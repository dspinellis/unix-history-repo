Insert Mode
===========

You can enter insert mode by one of the following commands.  In
addition to these, you will enter insert mode if you give a change
command with a line command as the motion command.  Insert commands
are also modifying commands and you can repeat them by the repeat
command `.' (`vip-repeat').

`i'
     Enter insert mode at point (`vip-insert').

`I'
     Enter insert mode at the first non white character on the line
     (`vip-Insert').

`a'
     Move point forward by one character and then enter insert mode
     (`vip-append').

`A'
     Enter insert mode at end of line (`vip-Append').

`o'
     Open a new line below the current line and enter insert mode
     (`vip-open-line').

`O'
     Open a new line above the current line and enter insert mode
     (`vip-Open-line').

`C-o'
     Insert a newline and leave point before it, and then enter
     insert mode 
     (`vip-open-line-at-point').

Insert mode is almost like emacs mode.  Only the following 4 keys
behave differently from emacs mode.

`ESC'
     This key will take you back to vi mode (`vip-change-mode-to-vi').

`C-h'
     Delete previous character (`delete-backward-char').

`C-w'
     Delete previous word (`vip-delete-backward-word').

`C-z'
     This key simulates ESC key in emacs mode.  For instance, typing
     `C-z x' in insert mode iw the same as typing `ESC x' in emacs
     mode (`vip-ESC').

You can also bind `C-h' to `help-command' if you like.  (*Note
Customizing Key Bindings::, for details.)  Binding `C-h' to
`help-command' has the effect of making the meaning of `C-h' uniform
among emacs, vi and insert modes.

When you enter insert mode, VIP records point as the start point of
insertion, and when you leave insert mode the region between point
and start point is saved for later use by repeat command etc. 
Therefore, repeat command will not really repeat insertion if you
move point by emacs commands while in insert mode.



File: vip,  Node: Ex Commands,  Next: Ex Command Reference,  Prev: Commands in Insert Mode,  Up: Top

Ex Commands
***********

In vi mode, you can execute an Ex command EX-COMMAND by typing:

     `: EX-COMMAND RET'

Every Ex command follows the following pattern:

     ADDRESS COMMAND `!' PARAMETERS COUNT FLAGS

where all parts are optional.  For the syntax of "address", the
reader is referred to the reference manual of Ex.

In the current version of VIP, searching by Ex commands is always
"magic".  That is, search patterns are always treated as "regular
expressions".  For example, a typical forward search would be invoked
by `:/PAT/'.  If you wish to include `/' as part of PAT you must
preceded it by `\'.  VIP strips off these `\''s before `/' and the
resulting PAT becomes the actual search pattern.  Emacs provides a
different and richer class or regular expressions than Vi/Ex, and VIP
uses Emacs' regular expressions.  See GNU Emacs Manual for details of
regular expressions.

Several Ex commands can be entered in a line by separating them by a
pipe character `|'.

Ex Command Reference
====================

In this section we briefly explain all the Ex commands supported by
VIP.  Most Ex commands expect ADDRESS as their argument, and they use
default addresses if they are not explicitly given.  In the
following, such default addresses will be shown in parentheses.

Most command names can and preferably be given in abbreviated forms. 
In the following, optional parts of command names will be enclosed in
brackets.  For example, `co[py]' will mean that copy command can be
give as `co' or `cop' or `copy'.

If COMMAND is empty, point will move to the beginning of the line
specified by the ADDRESS.  If ADDRESS is also empty, point will move
to the beginning of the current line.

Some commands accept "flags" which are one of `p', `l' and `#'.  If
FLAGS are given, the text affected by the commands will be displayed
on a temporary window, and you will be asked to hit return to
continue.  In this way, you can see the text affected by the commands
before the commands will be executed.  If you hit `C-g' instead of
RET then the commands will be aborted.  Note that the meaning of
FLAGS is different in VIP from that in Vi/Ex.

`(.,.) co[py] ADDR FLAGS'
`(.,.) t ADDR FLAGS'
     Place a copy of specified lines after ADDR.  If ADDR is `0', it
     will be placed before the first line.

`(.,.) d[elete] REGISTER COUNT FLAGS'
     Delete specified lines.  Text will be saved in a named REGISTER
     if a lower case letter is given, and appended to a register if a
     capital letter is given.

`e[dit] ! +ADDR FILE'
`e[x] ! +ADDR FILE'
`vi[sual] ! +ADDR FILE'
     Edit a new file FILE in the current window.  The command will
     abort if current buffer is modified, which you can override by
     giving `!'.  If `+'ADDR is given, ADDR becomes the current line.

`file'
     Give information about the current file.

`(1,$) g[lobal] ! /PAT/ CMDS'
`(1,$) v /PAT/ CMDS'
     Among specified lines first mark each line which matches the
     regular expression PAT, and then execute CMDS on each marked line.
     If `!' is given, CMDS will be executed on each line not matching
     PAT.  `v' is same as `g!'.

`(.,.+1) j[oin] ! COUNT FLAGS'
     Join specified lines into a line.  Without `!', a space
     character will be inserted at each junction.

`(.) k CH'
`(.) mar[k] CH'
     Mark specified line by a lower case character CH.  Then the
     addressing form `''CH will refer to this line.  No white space
     is required between `k' and CH.  A white space is necessary
     between `mark' and CH, however.

`map CH RHS'
     Define a macro for vi mode.  After this command, the character
     CH will be expanded to RHS in vi mode.

`(.,.) m[ove] ADDR'
     Move specified lines after ADDR.

`(.) pu[t] REGISTER'
     Put back previously deleted or yanked text.  If REGISTER is
     given, the text saved in the register will be put back;
     otherwise, last deleted or yanked text will be put back.

`q[uit] !'
     Quit from Emacs.  If modified buffers with associated files
     exist, you will be asked whether you wish to save each of them. 
     At this point, you may choose not to quit, by hitting `C-g'.  If
     `!' is given, exit from Emacs without saving modified buffers.

`(.) r[ead] FILE'
     Read in the content of the file FILE after the specified line.

`(.) r[ead] ! COMMAND'
     Read in the output of the shell command COMMAND after the
     specified line.

`se[t]'
     Set a variable's value.  *Note Customizing Constants::, for the
     list of variables you can set.

`sh[ell]'
     Run a subshell in a window.

`(.,.) s[ubstitute] /PAT/REPL/ OPTIONS COUNT FLAGS'
`(.,.) & OPTIONS COUNT FLAGS'
     On each specified line, the first occurrence of string matching
     regular expression PAT is replaced by replacement pattern REPL. 
     Option characters are `g' and `c'.  If global option character
     `g' appears as part of OPTIONS, all occurrences are substituted.
     If confirm option character `c' appears, you will be asked to
     give confirmation before each substitution.  If `/PAT/REPL/' is
     missing, the last substitution is repeated.

`st[op]'
     Suspend Emacs.

`ta[g] TAG'
     Find first definition of TAG.  If no TAG is given, previously
     given TAG is used and next alternate definition is find.  By
     default, the file `TAGS' in the current directory becomes the
     "selected tag table".  You can select another tag table by `set'
     command.  *Note Customizing Constants::, for details.

`und[o]'
     Undo the last change.

`unm[ap] CH'
     The macro expansion associated with CH is removed.

`ve[rsion]'
     Tell the version number of VIP.

`(1,$) w[rite] ! FILE'
     Write out specified lines into file FILE.  If no FILE is given,
     text will be written to the file associated to the current
     buffer.  Unless `!' is given, if FILE is different from the file
     associated to the current buffer and if the file FILE exists,
     the command will not be executed.  Unlike Ex, FILE becomes the
     file associated to the current buffer.

`(1,$) w[rite]>> FILE'
     Write out specified lines at the end of file FILE.  FILE becomes
     the file associated to the current buffer.

`(1,$) wq ! FILE'
     Same as `write' and then `quit'.  If `!' is given, same as
     `write !' then `quit'.

`(.,.) y[ank] REGISTER COUNT'
     Save specified lines into register REGISTER.  If no register is
     specified, text will be saved in an anonymous register.

`ADDR ! COMMAND'
     Execute shell command COMMAND.  The output will be shown in a
     new window.  If ADDR is given, specified lines will be used as
     standard input to COMMAND.

`($) ='
     Print the line number of the addressed line.

`(.,.) > COUNT FLAGS'
     Shift specified lines to the right.  The variable
     `vip-shift-width' (default value is 8) determines the amount of
     shift.

`(.,.) < COUNT FLAGS'
     Shift specified lines to the left.  The variable
     `vip-shift-width' (default value is 8) determines the amount of
     shift.

`(.,.) ~ OPTIONS COUNT FLAGS'
     Repeat the previous `substitute' command using previous search
     pattern as PAT for matching.

The following Ex commands are available in Vi, but not implemented in
VIP.

     `abbreviate', `list', `next', `print', `preserve', `recover', `rewind', `source',
     `unabbreviate', `xit', `z'

If you have a file called `.vip' in your home directory, then it will
also be loaded when VIP is loaded.  This file is thus useful for
customizing VIP.

Customizing Constants
=====================

An easy way to customize VIP is to change the values of constants
used in VIP.  Here is the list of the constants used in VIP and their
default values.

`vip-shift-width 8'
     The number of columns shifted by `>' and `<' command.

`vip-re-replace nil'
     If `t' then do regexp replace, if `nil' then do string replace.

`vip-search-wrap-around t'
     If `t', search wraps around the buffer.

`vip-re-search nil'
     If `t' then search is reg-exp search, if `nil' then vanilla
     search.

`vip-case-fold-search nil'
     If `t' search ignores cases.

`vip-re-query-replace nil'
     If `t' then do reg-exp replace in query replace.

`vip-open-with-indent nil'
     If `t' then indent to the previous current line when open a new
     line by `o' or `O' command.

`vip-tags-file-name "TAGS"'
     The name of the file used as the tag table.

`vip-help-in-insert-mode nil'
     If `t' then C-h is bound to `help-command' in insert mode, if
     `nil' then it sis bound to `delete-backward-char'.

You can reset these constants in VIP by the Ex command `set'.  Or you
can include a line like this in your `.vip' file:

     (setq vip-case-fold-search t)



File: vip,  Node: Customizing Key Bindings,  Prev: Customizing Constants,  Up: Customization

Customizing Key Bindings
========================

VIP uses `vip-command-mode-map' as the "local keymap" for vi mode. 
For example, in vi mode, SPC is bound to the function `vip-scroll'. 
But, if you wish to make SPC and some other keys  behave like Vi, you
can include the following lines in your `.vip' file.

     (define-key vip-command-mode-map "\C-g" 'vip-info-on-file)
     (define-key vip-command-mode-map "\C-h" 'vip-backward-char)
     (define-key vip-command-mode-map "\C-m" 'vip-next-line-at-bol)
     (define-key vip-command-mode-map " " 'vip-forward-char)
     (define-key vip-command-mode-map "g" 'vip-keyboard-quit)
     (define-key vip-command-mode-map "s" 'vip-substitute)
     (define-key vip-command-mode-map "C" 'vip-change-to-eol)
     (define-key vip-command-mode-map "R" 'vip-change-to-eol)
     (define-key vip-command-mode-map "S" 'vip-substitute-line)
     (define-key vip-command-mode-map "X" 'vip-delete-backward-char)
