VIP ***

VIP is a Vi emulating package written in Emacs Lisp.  VIP implements
most Vi commands including Ex commands.  It is therefore hoped that
this package will enable you to do Vi style editing under the
powerful GNU Emacs environment.  This info file describes the usage
of VIP assuming that you are fairly accustomed to Vi but not so much
with Emacs.  Also we will concentrate mainly on differences from Vi,
especially features unique to VIP.

It is recommended that you read nodes on survey and on customization
before you start using VIP.  Other nodes may be visited as needed.

Comments and bug reports are welcome.  Please send messages to
`ms@Sail.Stanford.Edu' if you are outside of Japan and to
`masahiko@sato.riec.tohoku.junet' if you are in Japan.

Basic Concepts
==============

We begin by explaining some basic concepts of Emacs.  These concepts
are explained in more detail in the GNU Emacs Manual.

Conceptually, a "buffer" is just a string of ASCII characters and two
special characters PNT ("point") and MRK ("mark") such that the
character PNT occurs exactly once and MRK occurs at most once.  The
"text" of a buffer is obtained by deleting the occurrences of PNT and
MRK.  If, in a buffer, there is a character following PNT then we say
that point is "looking at" the character; otherwise we say that point
is "at the end of buffer".  PNT and MRK are used to indicate
positions in a buffer and they are not part of the text of the
buffer.  If a buffer contains a MRK then the text between MRK and PNT
is called the "region" of the buffer.

Emacs provides (multiple) "windows" on the screen, and you can see
the content of a buffer through the window associated with the
buffer.  The cursor of the screen is always positioned on the
character after PNT.

A "keymap" is a table that records the bindings between characters
and command functions.  There is the "global keymap" common to all
the buffers.  Each buffer has its "local keymap" that determines the
"mode" of the buffer.  Local keymap overrides global keymap, so that
if a function is bound to some key in the local keymap then that
function will be executed when you type the key.  If no function is
bound to a key in the local map, however, the function bound to the
key in the global map becomes in effect.

Loading VIP
===========

The recommended way to load VIP automatically is to include the line:

     (load "vip")

in your `.emacs' file.  The `.emacs' file is placed in your home
directory and it will be executed every time you invoke Emacs.  If
you wish to be in vi mode whenver Emacs starts up, you can include
the following line in your `.emacs' file instead of the above line:

     (setq term-setup-hook 'vip-mode)

(*Note Vi Mode::, for the explanation of vi mode.)

Even if your `.emacs' file does not contain any of the above lines,
you can load VIP and enter vi mode by typing the following from
within Emacs.

     M-x vip-mode



File: vip,  Node: Modes in VIP,  Next: Emacs Mode,  Prev: Loading VIP,  Up: Survey

Modes in VIP
============

Loading VIP has the effect of globally binding `C-z' (`Control-z') to
the function `vip-change-mode-to-vi'. The default binding of `C-z' in
GNU Emacs is `suspend-emacs', but, you can also call `suspend-emacs'
by typing `C-x C-z'.  Other than this, all the key bindings of Emacs
remain the same after loading VIP.

Now, if you hit `C-z', the function `vip-change-mode-to-vi' will be
called and you will be in "vi mode".  (Some major modes may locally
bind `C-z' to some special functions.  In such cases, you can call
`vip-change-mode-to-vi' by `execute-extended-command' which is
invoked by `M-x'.  Here `M-x' means `Meta-x', and if your terminal
does not have a META key you can enter it by typing `ESC x'.  The
same effect can also be achieve by typing `M-x vip-mode'.)

You can observe the change of mode by looking at the "mode line". 
For instance, if the mode line is:

     -----Emacs: *scratch*              (Lisp Interaction)----All------------

then it will change to:

     -----Vi:    *scratch*              (Lisp Interaction)----All------------

Thus the word `Emacs' in the mode line will change to `Vi'.

You can go back to the original "emacs mode" by typing `C-z' in vi
mode.  Thus `C-z' toggles between these two modes.

Note that modes in VIP exist orthogonally to modes in Emacs.  This
means that you can be in vi mode and at the same time, say, shell mode.

Vi mode corresponds to Vi's command mode.  From vi mode you can enter
"insert mode" (which corresponds to Vi's insert mode) by usual Vi
command keys like `i', `a', `o' ... etc.

In insert mode, the mode line will look like this:

     -----Insert *scratch*              (Lisp Interaction)----All------------

You can exit from insert mode by hitting ESC key as you do in Vi.

That VIP has three modes may seem very complicated, but in fact it is
not so.  VIP is implemented so that you can do most editing remaining
only in the two modes for Vi (that is vi mode and insert mode).

The figure below shows the transition of three modes in VIP.


     
                     === C-z ==>          == i,o ... ==>
     emacs mode             vi mode                 insert mode
                <== X-z ===          <=== ESC ====

* Menu:

* Emacs Mode::		This is the mode you should know better.
* Vi Mode::		Vi commands are executed in this mode.
* Insert Mode::		You can enter text, and also can do editing if you
			know enough Emacs commands.

 

File: vip,  Node: Emacs Mode,  Next: Vi Mode,  Prev: Modes in VIP,  Up: Modes in VIP

Emacs Mode
----------

You will be in this mode just after you loaded VIP.  You can do all
normal Emacs editing in this mode.  Note that the key `C-z' is
globally bound to `vip-change-mode-to-vi'.  So, if you type `C-z' in
this mode then you will be in vi mode.



File: vip,  Node: Vi Mode,  Next: Insert Mode,  Prev: Emacs Mode,  Up: Modes in VIP

Vi Mode
-------

This mode corresponds to Vi's command mode.  Most Vi commands work as
they do in Vi.  You can go back to emacs mode by typing `C-z'.  You
can enter insert mode, just as in Vi, by typing `i', `a' etc.



File: vip,  Node: Insert Mode,  Next: Differences from Vi,  Prev: Vi Mode,  Up: Modes in VIP

Insert Mode
-----------

The key bindings in this mode is the same as in the emacs mode except
for the following 4 keys.  So, you can move around in the buffer and
change its content while you are in insert mode.

`ESC'
     This key will take you back to vi mode.

`C-h'
     Delete previous character.

`C-w'
     Delete previous word.

`C-z'
     Typing this key has the same effect as typing ESC in emacs mode.
     Thus typing `C-z x' in insert mode will have the same effect as
     typing `ESC x' in emacs mode.



File: vip,  Node: Differences from Vi,  Next: Undoing,  Prev: Insert Mode,  Up: Survey

Differences from Vi
===================

The major differences from Vi are explained below.

* Menu:

* Undoing::		You can undo more in VIP.
* Changing::		Commands for changing the text.
* Searching::		Search commands.
* z Command::		You can now use zH, zM and zL as well as z- etc.
* Counts::		Some Vi commands which do not accept a count now
			accept one.
* Marking::		You can now mark the current point, beginning of
			the buffer etc.
* Region Commands::	You can now give a region as an argument for delete
			commands etc.
* New Commands::	Some new commands not available in Vi are added.
* New Bindings::	Bindings of some keys are changed for the
			convenience of editing under Emacs.
* Window Commands::	Commands for moving among windows etc.
* Buffer Commands::	Commands for selecting buffers etc.
* File Commands::	Commands for visiting files etc.
* Misc Commands::	Other useful commands.

 

File: vip,  Node: Undoing,  Next: Changing,  Prev: Differences from Vi,  Up: Differences from Vi

Undoing
-------

You can repeat undoing by the `.' key.  So, `u' will undo a single
change, while `u . . .', for instance, will undo 4 previous changes. 
Undo is undoable as in Vi.  So the content of the buffer will be the
same before and after `u u'.



File: vip,  Node: Changing,  Next: Searching,  Prev: Undoing,  Up: Differences from Vi

Changing
--------

Some commands which change a small number of characters are executed
slightly differently.  Thus, if point is at the beginning of a word
`foo' and you wished to change it to `bar' by typing `c w', then VIP
will prompt you for a new word in the minibuffer by the prompt `foo
=> '.  You can then enter `bar' followed by RET or ESC to complete
the command.  Before you enter RET or ESC you can abort the command
by typing `C-g'.  In general, you can abort a partially formed
command by typing `C-g'.



File: vip,  Node: Searching,  Next: z Command,  Prev: Changing,  Up: Differences from Vi

Searching
---------

As in Vi, searching is done by `/' and `?'.  The string will be
searched literally by default.  To invoke a regular expression
search, first execute the search command `/' (or `?') with empty
search string.  (I.e, type `/' followed by RET.) A search for empty
string will toggle the search mode between vanilla search and regular
expression search.  You cannot give an offset to the search string. 
(It is a limitation.)  By default, search will wrap around the buffer
as in Vi.  You can change this by rebinding the variable
`vip-search-wrap-around'.  *Note Customization::, for how to do this.



File: vip,  Node: z Command,  Next: Counts,  Prev: Searching,  Up: Differences from Vi

z Command
---------

For those of you who cannot remember which of `z' followed by RET,
`.' and `-' do what.  You can also use `z' followed by `H', `M' and
`L' to place the current line in the Home (Middle, and Last) line of
the window.



File: vip,  Node: Counts,  Next: Marking,  Prev: z Command,  Up: Differences from Vi

Counts
------

Some Vi commands which do not accept a count now accept one

`p'
`P'
     Given counts, text will be yanked (in Vi's sense) that many
     times.  Thus `3 p' is the same as `p p p'.

`o'
`O'
     Given counts, that many copies of text will be inserted. Thus `o
     a b c ESC' will insert 3 lines of `abc' below the current line.

`/'
`?'
     Given a count N, N-th occurrence will be searched.



File: vip,  Node: Marking,  Next: Region Commands,  Prev: Counts,  Up: Differences from Vi

Marking
-------

Typing an `m' followed by a lower case character CH marks the point
to the register named CH as in Vi.  In addition to these, we have
following key bindings for marking.

`m <'
     Set mark at the beginning of buffer.

`m >'
     Set mark at the end of buffer.

`m .'
     Set mark at point (and push old mark on mark ring).

`m ,'
     Jump to mark (and pop mark off the mark ring).



File: vip,  Node: Region Commands,  Next: New Commands,  Prev: Marking,  Up: Differences from Vi

Region Commands
---------------

Vi operators like `d', `c' etc. are usually used in combination with
motion commands.  It is now possible to use current region as the
argument to these operators.  (A "region" is a part of buffer
delimited by point and mark.)  The key `r' is used for this purpose. 
Thus `d r' will delete the current region.  If `R' is used instead of
`r' the region will first be enlarged so that it will become the
smallest region containing the original region and consisting of
whole lines.  Thus `m . d R' will have the same effect as `d d'.



File: vip,  Node: New Commands,  Next: New Bindings,  Prev: Region Commands,  Up: Differences from Vi

Some New Commands
-----------------

Note that the keys below (except for `R') are not used in Vi.

`C-a'
     Move point to the beginning of line.

`C-n'
     If you have two or more windows in the screen, this key will
     move point to the next window.

`C-o'
     Insert a newline and leave point before it, and then enter
     insert mode.

`C-r'
     Backward incremental search.

`C-s'
     Forward incremental search.

`C-c'
`C-x'
`ESC'
     These keys will exit from vi mode and return to emacs mode
     temporarily.  If you hit one of these keys, Emacs will be in
     emacs mode and will believe that you hit that key in emacs mode.
     For example, if you hit `C-x' followed by `2', then the current
     window will be split into 2 and you will be in vi mode again.

`\'
     Escape to emacs mode.  Hitting `\' will take you to emacs mode,
     and you can execute a single Emacs command.  After executing the
     Emacs command you will be in vi mode again.  You can give a
     count before typing `\'.  Thus `5 \ *', as well as `\ C-u 5 *',
     will insert `*****' before point.  Similarly `1 0 \ C-p' will
     move the point 10 lines above the current line.

`K'
     Kill current buffer if it is not modified.  Useful when you
     selected a buffer which you did not want.

`Q'
`R'
     `Q' is for query replace and `R' is for replace.  By default,
     string to be replaced are treated literally.  If you wish to do
     a regular expression replace, first do replace with empty string
     as the string to be replaced.  In this way, you can toggle
     between vanilla and regular expression replacement.

`v'
`V'
     These keys are used to Visit files.  `v' will switch to a buffer
     visiting file whose name can be entered in the minibuffer. `V'
     is similar, but will use window different from the current window.

`#'
     If followed by a certain character CH, it becomes an operator
     whose argument is the region determined by the motion command
     that follows.  Currently, CH can be one of `c', `C', `g', `q'
     and `s'.

`# c'
     Change upper case characters in the region to lower case
     (`downcase-region').

`# C'
     Change lower case characters in the region to upper case. For
     instance, `# C 3 w' will capitalize 3 words from the current
     point (`upcase-region').

`# g'
     Execute last keyboard macro for each line in the region
     (`vip-global-execute').

`# q'
     Insert specified string at the beginning of each line in the
     region (`vip-quote-region').

`# s'
     Check spelling of words in the region (`spell-region').

`*'
     Call last keyboard macro.



File: vip,  Node: New Bindings,  Next: Window Commands,  Prev: New Commands,  Up: Differences from Vi

New Key Bindings
----------------

In VIP the meanings of some keys are entirely different from Vi. 
These key bindings are done deliberately in the hope that editing
under Emacs will become easier.  It is however possible to rebind
these keys to functions which behave similarly as in Vi.  *Note
Customizing Key Bindings::, for details.

`C-g'
`g'
     In Vi, `C-g' is used to get information about the file
     associated to the current buffer.  Here, `g' will do that, and
     `C-g' is used to abort a command (this is for compatibility with
     emacs mode.)

`SPC'
`RET'
     Now these keys will scroll up and down the text of current window.
     Convenient for viewing the text.

`s'
`S'
     They are used to switch to a specified buffer.  Useful for
     switching to already existing buffer since buffer name
     completion is provided.  Also a default buffer will be given as
     part of the prompt, to which you can switch by just typing RET
     key.  `s' is used to select buffer in the current window, while
     `S' selects buffer in another window.

`C'
`X'
     These keys will exit from vi mode and return to emacs mode
     temporarily.  If you type `C' (`X'), Emacs will be in emacs mode
     and will believe that you have typed `C-c' (`C-x', resp.) in
     emacs mode. Moreover, if the following character you type is an
     upper case letter, then Emacs will believe that you have typed
     the corresponding control character.  You will be in vi mode
     again after the command is executed.  For example, typing `X S'
     in vi mode is the same as typing `C-x C-s' in emacs mode.  You
     get the same effect by typing `C-x C-s' in vi mode, but the idea
     here is that you can execute useful Emacs commands without
     typing control characters. For example, if you hit `X' (or
     `C-x') followed by `2', then the current window will be split
     into 2 and you will be in vi mode again.

In addition to these, `ctl-x-map' is slightly modified:

`X 3'
`C-x 3'
     This is equivalent to `C-x 1 C-x 2' (1 + 2 = 3).

Vi Commands
***********

This chapter describes Vi commands other than Ex commands implemented
in VIP.  Except for the last section which discusses insert mode, all
the commands described in this chapter are to be used in vi mode.

* Menu:

* Numeric Arguments::	Many commands accept numeric arguments
* Important Keys::	Some very important keys.
* Buffers and Windows::	Commands for handling buffers and windows.
* Files::		Commands for handling files.
* Viewing the Buffer::	How you can view the current buffer.

File: vip,  Node: Numeric Arguments,  Next: Important Keys,  Prev: Vi Commands,  Up: Vi Commands

Numeric Arguments
=================

Most Vi commands accept a "numeric argument" which can be supplied as
a prefix to the commands.  A numeric argument is also called a "count".
In many cases, if a count is given, the command is executed that many
times.  For instance, `5 d d' deletes 5 lines while simple `d d'
deletes a line.  In this manual the metavariable N will denote a count.



File: vip,  Node: Important Keys,  Next: Buffers and Windows,  Prev: Numeric Arguments,  Up: Vi Commands

Important Keys
==============

The keys `C-g' and `C-l' are unique in that their associated
functions are the same in any of emacs, vi and insert mode.

`C-g'
     Quit.  Cancel running or partially typed command
     (`keyboard-quit').

`C-l'
     Clear the screen and reprint everything (`recenter').

In Emacs many commands are bound to the key strokes that start with
`C-x', `C-c' and ESC.  These commands can be accessed from vi mode as
easily as from emacs mode.

`C-x'
`C-c'
`ESC'
     Typing one of these keys have the same effect as typing it in
     emacs mode.  Appropriate command will be executed according as
     the keys you type after it.  You will be in vi mode again after
     the execution of the command.  For instance, if you type `ESC <'
     (in vi mode) then the cursor will move to the beginning of the
     buffer and you will still be in vi mode.

`C'
`X'
     Typing one of these keys have the effect of typing the
     corresponding control character in emacs mode.  Moreover, if you
     type an upper case character following it, that character will
     also be translated to the corresponding control character.  Thus
     typing `X W' in vi mode is the same as typing `C-x C-w' in emacs
     mode.  You will be in vi mode again after the execution of a
     command.

`\'
     Escape to emacs mode.  Hitting the `\' key will take you to
     emacs mode, and you can execute a single Emacs command.  After
     executing the Emacs command you will be in vi mode again.  You
     can give a count before typing `\'.  Thus `5 \ +', as well as `\
     C-u 5 +', will insert `+++++' before point.



File: vip,  Node: Buffers and Windows,  Next: Files,  Prev: Important Keys,  Up: Vi Commands

Buffers and Windows
===================

In Emacs the text you edit is stored in a "buffer".  See GNU Emacs
Manual, for details.  There is always one "selected" buffer which is
called the "current buffer".

You can see the contents of buffers through "windows" created by Emacs.
When you have multiple windows on the screen only one of them is
selected.  Each buffer has a unique name, and each window has a mode
line which shows the name of the buffer associated with the window
and other information about the status of the buffer.  You can change
the format of the mode line, but normally if you see `**' at the
beginning of a mode line it means that the buffer is "modified".  If
you write out the content of the buffer to a file, then the buffer
will become not modified.  Also if you see `%%' at the beginning of
the mode line, it means that the file associated with the buffer is
write protected.

We have the following commands related to windows and buffers.

`C-n'
     Move cursor to the next-window (`vip-next-window').

`X 1'
     Delete other windows and make the selected window fill the screen 
     (`delete-other-windows').

`X 2'
     Split current window into two windows (`split-window-vertically').

`X 3'
     Show current buffer in two windows.

`s BUFFER RET'
     Select or create a buffer named BUFFER (`vip-switch-to-buffer').

`S BUFFER RET'
     Similar but select a buffer named BUFFER in another window 
     (`vip-switch-to-buffer-other-window').

`K'
     Kill the current buffer if it is not modified or if it is not
     associated with a file 
     (`vip-kill-buffer').

`X B'
     List the existing buffers (`list-buffers').

As "buffer name completion" is provided, you have only to type in
initial substring of the buffer name which is sufficient to identify
it among names of existing buffers.  After that, if you hit TAB the
rest of the buffer name will be supplied by the system, and you can
confirm it by RET.  The default buffer name to switch to will also be
prompted, and you can select it by giving a simple RET.  See GNU
Emacs Manual for details of completion.



File: vip,  Node: Files,  Next: Viewing the Buffer,  Prev: Buffers and Windows,  Up: Vi Commands

Files
=====

We have the following commands related to files.  They are used to
visit, save and insert files.

`v FILE RET'
     Visit specified file in the current window (`vip-find-file').

`V FILE RET'
     Visit specified file in another window
     (`vip-find-file-other-window').

`X S'
     Save current buffer to the file associated with the buffer.  If
     no file is associated with the buffer, the name of the file to
     write out the content of the buffer will be asked in the
     minibuffer.

`X W FILE RET'
     Write current buffer into a specified file.

`X I FILE RET'
     Insert a specified file at point.

`g'
     Give information on the file associated with the current buffer.
     Tell you the name of the file associated with the buffer, the
     line number of the current point and total line numbers in the
     buffer.  If no file is associated with the buffer, this fact
     will be indicated by the null file name `""'.

In Emacs, you can edit a file by "visiting" it.  If you wish to visit
a file in the current window, you can just type `v'.  Emacs maintains
the "default directory" which is specific to each buffer.  Suppose,
for instance, that the default directory of the current buffer is
`/usr/masahiko/lisp/'.  Then you will get the following prompt in the
minibuffer.

     visit file: /usr/masahiko/lisp/

If you wish to visit, say, `vip.el' in this directory, then you can
just type `vip.el' followed by RET.  If the file `vip.el' already
exists in the directory, Emacs will visit that file, and if not, the
file will be created.  Emacs will use the file name (`vip.el', in
this case) as the name of the buffer visiting the file.  In order to
make the buffer name unique, Emacs may append `<2>', `<3>' etc., to
the buffer name.  As the "file name completion" is provided here, you
can sometime save typing.  For instance, suppose there is only one
file in the default directory whose name starts with `v', that is
`vip.el'.  Then if you just type `v TAB' then it will be completed to
`vip.el'.  Thus, in this case, you just have to type `v v TAB RET' to
visit `/usr/masahiko/lisp/vip.el'.  Continuing the example, let us
now suppose that you wished to visit the file
`/usr/masahiko/man/vip.texinfo'.  Then to the same prompt which you
get after you typed `v', you can enter
`/usr/masahiko/man/vip.texinfo' or `../man/vip.texinfo' followed by
RET.

Use `V' instead of `v', if you wish to visit a file in another window.

You can verify which file you are editing by typing `g'.  (You can
also type `X B' to get nformation on other buffers too.)  If you type
`g' you will get an information like below in the echo area:

     "/usr/masahiko/man/vip.texinfo" line 921 of 1949

After you edited the buffer (`vip.texinfo', in our example) for a
while, you may wish to save it in a file.  If you wish to save it in
the file associated with the buffer (`/usr/masahiko/man/vip.texinfo',
in this case), you can just say `X S'.  If you wish to save it in
another file, you can type `X W'.  You will then get a similar prompt
as you get for `v', to which you can enter the file name.

Viewing the Buffer
==================

In this and next section we discuss commands for moving around in the
buffer.  These command do not change the content of the buffer.  The
following commands are useful for viewing the content of the current
buffer.

`SPC'
`C-f'
     Scroll text of current window upward almost full screen.  You
     can go forward in the buffer by this command (`vip-scroll').

`RET'
`C-b'
     Scroll text of current window downward almost full screen.  You
     can go backward in the buffer by this command (`vip-scroll-back').

`C-d'
     Scroll text of current window upward half screen.  You can go
     down in the buffer by this command (`vip-scroll-down').

`C-u'
     Scroll text of current window downward half screen.  You can go
     up in the buffer by this command (`vip-scroll-up').

`C-y'
     Scroll text of current window upward by one line
     (`vip-scroll-down-one').

`C-e'
     Scroll text of current window downward by one line
     (`vip-scroll-up-one').

You can repeat these commands by giving a count.  Thus, `2 SPC' has
the same effect as `SPC SPC'.

The following commands reposition point in the window.

`z H'
`z RET'
     Put point on the top (home) line in the window.  So the current
     line becomes the top line in the window.  Given a count N, point
     will be placed in the N-th line from top (`vip-line-to-top').

`z M'
`z .'
     Put point on the middle line in the window.  Given a count N,
     point will be placed in the N-th line from the middle line
     (`vip-line-to-middle').

`z L'
`z -'
     Put point on the bottom line in the window.  Given a count N,
     point will be placed in the N-th line from bottom
     (`vip-line-to-bottom').

`C-l'
     Center point in window and redisplay screen (`recenter').

Mark Commands
=============

The following commands are used to mark positions in the buffer.

`m CH'
     Store current point in the register CH.  CH must be a lower case
     character between `a' and `z'.

`m <'
     Set mark at the beginning of current buffer.

`m >'
     Set mark at the end of current buffer.

`m .'
     Set mark at point.

`m ,'
     Jump to mark (and pop mark off the mark ring).

Emacs uses the "mark ring" to store marked positions.  The commands
`m <', `m >' and `m .' not only set mark but also add it as the
latest element of the mark ring (replacing the oldest one).  By
repeating the command ``m ,'' you can visit older and older marked
positions.  You will eventually be in a loop as the mark ring is a
ring.



File: vip,  Node: Motion Commands,  Next: Searching and Replacing,  Prev: Mark Commands,  Up: Vi Commands

Motion Commands
===============

Commands for moving around in the current buffer are collected here. 
These commands are used as an `argument' for the delete, change and
yank commands to be described in the next section.

`h'
     Move point backward by one character.  Signal error if point is
     at the beginning of buffer, but (unlike Vi) do not complain
     otherwise (`vip-backward-char').

`l'
     Move point backward by one character.  Signal error if point is
     at the end of buffer, but (unlike Vi) do not complain otherwise
     (`vip-forward-char').

`j'
     Move point to the next line keeping the current column.  If
     point is on the last line of the buffer, a new line will be
     created and point will move to that line (`vip-next-line').

`k'
     Move point to the previous line keeping the current column
     (`vip-next-line').

`+'
     Move point to the next line at the first non-white character. 
     If point is on the last line of the buffer, a new line will be
     created and point will move to the beginning of that line
     (`vip-next-line-at-bol').

`-'
     Move point to the previous line at the first non-white character
     (`vip-previous-line-at-bol').

If a count is given to these commands, the commands will be repeated
that many times.

`0'
     Move point to the beginning of line (`vip-beginning-of-line').

`^'
     Move point to the first non-white character on the line
     (`vip-bol-and-skip-white').

`$'
     Move point to the end of line (`vip-goto-eol').

`N |'
     Move point to the N-th column on the line (`vip-goto-col').

Except for the `|' command, these commands neglect a count.

`w'
     Move point forward to the beginning of the next word
     (`vip-forward-word').

`W'
     Move point forward to the beginning of the next word, where a
     "word" is considered as a sequence of non-white characters
     (`vip-forward-Word').

`b'
     Move point backward to the beginning of a word
     (`vip-backward-word').

`B'
     Move point backward to the beginning of a word, where a word is
     considered as a sequence of non-white characters
     (`vip-forward-Word').

`e'
     Move point forward to the end of a word (`vip-end-of-word').

`E'
     Move point forward to the end of a word, where a word is
     considered as a sequence of non-white characters
     (`vip-end-of-Word').

Here the meaning of the word `word' for the `w', `b' and `e' commands
is determined by the "syntax table" effective in the current buffer. 
Each major mode has its syntax mode, and therefore the meaning of a
word also changes as the major mode changes.  See GNU Emacs Manual
for details of syntax table.

`H'
     Move point to the beginning of the home (top) line of the window.
     Given a count N, go to the N-th line from top (`vip-window-top').

`M'
     Move point to the beginning of the middle line of the window. 
     Given a count N, go to the N-th line from the middle line
     (`vip-window-middle').

`L'
     Move point to the beginning of the lowest (bottom) line of the
     window.  Given count, go to the N-th line from bottom
     (`vip-window-bottom').

These commands can be used to go to the desired line visible on the
screen.

`('
     Move point backward to the beginning of the sentence
     (`vip-backward-sentence').

`)'
     Move point forward to the end of the sentence
     (`vip-forward-sentence').

`{'
     Move point backward to the beginning of the paragraph
     (`vip-backward-paragraph').

`}'
     Move point forward to the end of the paragraph
     (`vip-forward-paragraph').

A count repeats the effect for these commands.

`G'
     Given a count N, move point to the N-th line in the buffer on
     the first non-white character.  Without a count, go to the end
     of the buffer (`vip-goto-line').

`` `'
     Exchange point and mark (`vip-goto-mark').

`` CH'
     Move point to the position stored in the register CH.  CH must
     be a lower case letter.

`' ''
     Exchange point and mark, and then move point to the first
     non-white character on the line (`vip-goto-mark-and-skip-white').

`' CH'
     Move point to the position stored in the register CH and skip to
     the first non-white character on the line.  CH must be a lower
     case letter.

`%'
     Move point to the matching parenthesis if point is looking at
     `(', `)', `{', `}', `[' or `]' 
     (`vip-paren-match').

The command `G' mark point before move, so that you can return to the
original point by `` `'.  The original point will also be stored in
the mark ring.

The following commands are useful for moving points on the line.  A
count will repeat the effect.

`f CH'
     Move point forward to the character CH on the line.  Signal
     error if CH could not be found (`vip-find-char-forward').

`F CH'
     Move point backward to the character CH on the line.  Signal
     error if CH could not be found (`vip-find-char-backward').

`t CH'
     Move point forward upto the character CH on the line.  Signal
     error if CH could not be found (`vip-goto-char-forward').

`T CH'
     Move point backward upto the character CH on the line.  Signal
     error if CH could not be found (`vip-goto-char-backward').

`;'
     Repeat previous `f', `t', `F' or `T' command (`vip-repeat-find').

`,'
     Repeat previous `f', `t', `F' or `T' command, in the opposite
     direction (`vip-repeat-find-opposite').



File: vip,  Node: Searching and Replacing,  Next: Modifying Commands,  Prev: Motion Commands,  Up: Vi Commands

Searching and Replacing
=======================

Following commands are available for searching and replacing.

`/ STRING RET'
     Search the first occurrence of the string STRING forward
     starting from point.  Given a count N, the N-th occurrence of
     STRING will be searched.  If the variable `vip-re-search' has
     value `t' then "regular expression" search is done and the
     string matching the regular expression STRING is found.  If you
     give an empty string as STRING then the search mode will change
     from vanilla search to regular expression search and vice versa
     (`vip-search-forward').

`? STRING RET'
     Same as `/', except that search is done backward
     (`vip-search-backward').

`n'
     Search the previous search pattern in the same direction as
     before (`vip-search-next').

`N'
     Search the previous search pattern in the opposite direction
     (`vip-search-Next').

`C-s'
     Search forward incrementally.  See GNU Emacs Manual for details
     (`isearch-forward').

`C-r'
     Search backward incrementally (`isearch-backward').

`R STRING RET NEWSTRING'
     There are two modes of replacement, "vanilla" and "regular
     expression".  If the mode is vanilla you will get a prompt
     `Replace string:', and if the mode is regular expression you
     will ge a prompt `Replace regexp:'.  The mode is initially
     vanilla, but you can toggle these modes by giving a null string
     as STRING.  If the mode is vanilla, this command replaces every
     occurrence of STRING with NEWSTRING.  If the mode is regular
     expression, STRING is treated as a regular expression and every
     string matching the regular expression is replaced with
     NEWSTRING (`vip-replace-string').

`Q	STRING RET NEWSTRING'
     Same as `R' except that you will be asked form confirmation
     before each replacement 
     (`vip-query-replace').

`r CH'
     Replace the character point is looking at by the character CH. 
     Give count, replace that many characters by CH
     (`vip-replace-char').

The commands `/' and `?' mark point before move, so that you can
return to the original point by `` `'.

Modifying Commands
==================

In this section, commands for modifying the content of a buffer are
described.  These commands affect the region determined by a motion
command which is given to the commands as their argument.

We classify motion commands into "point commands" and "line
commands".  The point commands are as follows:

     `h', `l', `0', `^', `$', `w', `W', `b', `B', `e', `E', `(', `)', `/', `?', ``', `f', `F', `t', `T', `%', `;', `,'

The line commands are as follows:

     `j', `k', `+', `-', `H', `M', `L', `{', `}', `G', `''

If a point command is given as an argument to a modifying command,
the region determined by the point command will be affected by the
modifying command. On the other hand, if a line command is given as
an argument to a modifying command, the region determined by the line
command will be enlarged so that it will become the smallest region
properly containing the region and consisting of whole lines (we call
this process "expanding the region"), and then the enlarged region
will be affected by the modifying command.

* Yank Commands::	Commands for yanking text in Vi's sense.
* Put Back Commands::	Commands for putting bake deleted/yanked text.
* Change Commands::	Commands for changing text.



File: vip,  Node: Delete Commands,  Next: Yank Commands,  Prev: Modifying Commands,  Up: Modifying Commands

Delete Commands
---------------

`d MOTION-COMMAND'
     Delete the region determined by the motion command MOTION-COMMAND.

For example, `d $' will delete the region between point and end of
current line since `$' is a point command that moves point to end of
line.  `d G' will delete the region between the beginning of current
line and end of the buffer, since `G' is a line command.  A count
given to the command above will become the count for the associated
motion command.  Thus, `3 d w' will delete three words.

It is also possible to save the deleted text into a register you
specify.  For example, you can say `" t 3 d w' to delete three words
and save it to register `t'.  The name of a register is a lower case
letter between `a' and `z'.  If you give an upper case letter as an
argument to a delete command, then the deleted text will be appended
to the content of the register having the corresponding lower case
letter as its name.  So, `" T d w' will delete a word and append it
to register `t'.  Other modifying commands also accept a register
name as their argument, and we will not repeat similar explanations.

We have more delete commands as below.

`d d'
     Delete a line.  Given a count N, delete N lines.

`d r'
     Delete current region.

`d R'
     Expand current region and delete it.

`D'
     Delete to the end of a line (`vip-kill-line').

`x'
     Delete a character after point.  Given N, delete N characters
     (`vip-delete-char').

`DEL'
     Delete a character before point.  Given N, delete N characters
     (`vip-delete-backward-char').



File: vip,  Node: Yank Commands,  Next: Put Back Commands,  Prev: Delete Commands,  Up: Modifying Commands

Yank Commands
-------------

Yank commands "yank" a text of buffer into a (usually anonymous)
register.  Here the word `yank' is used in Vi's sense.  Thus yank
commands do not alter the content of the buffer, and useful only in
combination with commands that put back the yanked text into the
buffer.

`y MOTION-COMMAND'
     Yank the region determined by the motion command MOTION-COMMAND.

For example, `y $' will yank the text between point and the end of
line into an anonymous register, while `"c y $' will yank the same
text into register `c'.

Use the following command to yank consecutive lines of text.

`y y'
`Y'
     Yank a line.  Given N, yank N lines (`vip-yank-line').

`y r'
     Yank current region.

`y R'
     Expand current region and yank it.



File: vip,  Node: Put Back Commands,  Next: Change Commands,  Prev: Yank Commands,  Up: Modifying Commands

Put Back Commands
-----------------

Deleted or yanked texts can be put back into the buffer by the
command below.

`p'
     Insert, after the character point is looking at, most recently
     deleted/yanked text from anonymous register. Given a register
     name argument, the content of the named register will be put
     back.  Given a count, the command will be repeated that many
     times. This command also checks if the text to put back ends
     with a new line character, and if so the text will be put below
     the current line (`vip-put-back').

`P'
     Insert at point most recently deleted/yanked text from anonymous
     register.  Given a register name argument, the content of the
     named register will be put back.  Given a count, the command
     will be repeated that many times.  This command also checks if
     the text to put back ends with a new line character, and if so
     the text will be put above the current line rather than at point
     (`vip-Put-back').

Thus, `" c p' will put back the content of the register `c' into the
buffer.  It is also possible to specify "number register" which is a
numeral between `1' and `9'.  If the number register N is specified,
N-th previously deleted/yanked text will be put back.  It is an error
to specify a number register for the delete/yank commands.



File: vip,  Node: Change Commands,  Next: Repeating and Undoing Modifications,  Prev: Put Back Commands,  Up: Modifying Commands

Change Commands
---------------

Most commonly used change command takes the following form.

`c MOTION-COMMAND'
     Replace the content of the region determined by the motion
     command MOTION-COMMAND by the text you type.  If the motion
     command is a point command then you will type the text into
     minibuffer, and if the motion command is a line command then the
     region will be deleted first and you can insert the text in
     INSERT MODE.

For example, if point is at the beginning of a word `foo' and you
wish to change it to `bar', you can type `c w'.  Then, as `w' is a
point command, you will get the prompt `foo =>' in the minibuffer,
for which you can type `b a r RET' to complete the change command.

`c c'
     Change a line.  Given a count, that many lines are changed.

`c r'
     Change current region.

`c R'
     Expand current region and change it.

Repeating and Undoing Modifications
-----------------------------------

VIP records the previous modifying command, so that it is easy to
repeat it.  It is also very easy to undo changes made by modifying
commands.

`u'
     Undo the last change.  You can undo more by repeating undo by
     the repeat command `.'.  For example, you can undo 5 previous
     changes by typing `u....'.  If you type `uu', then the second
     `u' undoes the first undo command (`vip-undo').

`.'
     Repeat the last modifying command.  Given count N it becomes the
     new count for the repeated command.  Otherwise, the count for
     the last modifying command is used again (`vip-repeat').

Other Vi Commands
=================

Miscellaneous Vi commands are collected here.

`Z Z'
     Exit Emacs.  If modified buffers exist, you will be asked
     whether you wish to save them or not (`save-buffers-kill-emacs').

`! MOTION-COMMAND FORMAT-COMMAND'
`N ! ! FORMAT-COMMAND'
     The region determined by the motion command MOTION-COMMAND will
     be given to the shell command FORMAT-COMMAND and the region will
     be replaced by its output.  If a count is given, it will be
     passed to MOTION-COMMAND.  For example, `3!Gsort' will sort the
     region between point and the 3rd line.  If `!' is used instead
     of MOTION-COMMAND then N lines will be processed by
     FORMAT-COMMAND (`vip-command-argument').

`J'
     Join two lines.  Given count, join that many lines.  A space
     will be inserted at each junction (`vip-join-lines').

`< MOTION-COMMAND'
`N < <'
     Shift region determined by the motion command MOTION-COMMAND to
     left by SHIFT-WIDTH (default is 8).  If `<' is used instead of
     MOTION-COMMAND then shift N lines 
     (`vip-command-argument').

`> MOTION-COMMAND'
`N > >'
     Shift region determined by the motion command MOTION-COMMAND to
     right by SHIFT-WIDTH (default is 8).  If `<' is used instead of
     MOTION-COMMAND then shift N lines 
     (`vip-command-argument').

`= MOTION-COMMAND'
     Indent region determined by the motion command MOTION-COMMAND. 
     If `=' is used instead of MOTION-COMMAND then indent N lines
     (`vip-command-argument').

`*'
     Call last remembered keyboard macro.

`#'
     A new vi operator. *Note New Commands::, for more details.

The following keys are reserved for future extensions, and currently
assigned to a function that just beeps (`vip-nil').

     &, @, U, [, ], _, q, ~

VIP uses a special local keymap to interpret key strokes you enter in
vi mode.  The following keys are bound to NIL in the keymap. 
Therefore, these keys are interpreted by the global keymap of Emacs. 
We give below a short description of the functions bound to these
keys in the global keymap.  See GNU Emacs Manual for details.

`C-@'
     Set mark and push previous mark on mark ring (`set-mark-command').

`TAB'
     Indent line for current major mode (`indent-for-tab-command').

`LFD'
     Insert a newline, then indent according to mode
     (`newline-and-indent').

`C-k'
     Kill the rest of the current line; before a newline, kill the
     newline.  With prefix argument, kill that many lines from point.
     Negative arguments kill lines backward (`kill-line').

`C-l'
     Clear the screen and reprint everything (`recenter').

`N C-p'
     Move cursor vertically up N lines (`previous-line').

`C-q'
     Read next input character and insert it.  Useful for inserting
     control characters 
     (`quoted-insert').

`C-r'
     Search backward incrementally (`isearch-backward').

`C-s'
     Search forward incrementally (`isearch-forward').

`N C-t'
     Interchange charcters around point, moving forward one
     character.  With count N, take character before point and drag
     it forward past N other characters.  If no argument and at end
     of line, the previous two characters are exchanged
     (`transpose-chars').

`N C-v'
     Scroll text upward N lines.  If N is not given, scroll near full
     screen (`scroll-up').

`C-w'
     Kill between point and mark.  The text is save in the kill ring.
     The command `P' or `p' can retrieve it from kill ring
     (`kill-region').
