To save having to use absolute pathnames when you want to edit a nearby file
\s-2JOVE\s0 allows you to move around the

filesystem just as the c-shell does.
These commands are:
.IP "cd dir" 15n
Change to the specified directory.
.IP "pushd [dir]"
Like \fIcd\fP, but save the old directory on the directory stack.
With no directory argument, simply exchange the top two directories
on the stack and \fIcd\fP to the new top.
.IP "popd"
Take the current directory off the stack and \fIcd\fP to the directory now
at the top.
.IP "dirs"
Display the contents of the directory stack.

The names and behavior of these commands were chosen to mimic those in the c-shell.

\*(SN Indentation Commands

To save having to lay out C programs "by hand", \s-2JOVE\s0
has an idea of the correct indentation of a line,
based on the surrounding context.
When you are in C Mode, \s-2JOVE\s0 treats tabs specially \(em
typing a tab at the beginning of a new line means "indent to
the right place".
Closing braces are also handled specially, and are indented
to match the corresponding open brace.

To check that parentheses and braces match the way you think they do,
turn on \fIShow Match\fP mode (ESC X show-match-mode).  Then, whenever
you type a close brace or parenthesis, the cursor moves momentarily to
the matching opener, if it's currently visible.  If it's not visible,
\s-2JOVE\s0 displays the line containing the matching opener on the message
line.

C Tags
.XS \n(PN 5n
\*(SN C Tags
.XE
.LP
Often when you are editing a C program,
especially someone else's code,
you see a function call and wonder what that function does.
You then search for the function within the current file and if you're
lucky find
the definition, finally returning to the original spot when you are done.
However, if are unlucky, the function turns out to be external
(defined in another file) and
you have to suspend the edit,
\fIgrep\fP for the function name in every .c that might contain it,
and finally visit the appropriate file.
.LP
To avoid this diversion or the need to remember which
function is defined in which file,
Berkeley 
.UX
has a program called \fIctags(1)\fP, which
takes a set of source files and looks for function
definitions, producing a file called \fItags\fP as its output.
.LP
\s-2JOVE\s0 has a command called C-X T (\fIfind-tag\fP)
that prompts you for the name of a function (a \fItag\fP), looks up
the tag reference in the previously constructed tags file, 
then visits the file containing that tag in a new buffer,
with point positioned at the definition of the function.
There is another version of this command, namely \fIfind-tag-at-point\fP,
that uses the identifier at 
.I point.
.LP
So, when you've added new functions to a module, or moved some old
ones around, run the \fIctags\fP program to regenerate the \fItags\fP file.
\s-2JOVE\s0 looks in the file specified in the \fItag-file\fP variable.  The
default is "./tags", that is, the tag file in the current directory.  If you
wish to use an alternate tag file, you use C-U\ C-X\ T, and \s-2JOVE\s0 will
prompt for a file name.  If you find yourself specifying the same file again
and again, you can set \fItag-file\fP to that file, and run
\fIfind-tag\fP with no numeric argument.
.LP
To begin an editing session looking for a particular tag, use
the \fI\-t tag\fP command line option to \s-2JOVE\s0.
For example, say you wanted to look at the file containing the tag
\fISkipChar\fP, you would invoke \s-2JOVE\s0 as:
.DS I
.I
% jove \-t SkipChar
.R
.DE

You've typed in a program or altered an existing one and now you
want to run it through the compiler to check for errors.
To save having to suspend the edit,
run the compiler,
scribble down error messages, and then resume the edit,
\s-2JOVE\s0 allows you to compile your code while in the editor.
This is done with the C-X C-E (\fIcompile-it\fP) command.
If you run \fIcompile-it\fP with no argument
it runs the
.UX
\fImake\fP
program into a buffer;
If you need a special command or want to pass arguments to \fImake\fP,
run \fIcompile-it\fP with any argument (C-U is good enough) and you
will be prompted for the command to execute.

If any error messages are produced, they are treated specially by \s-2JOVE\s0.
That treatment is the subject of the next section.

\s-2JOVE\s0 knows how to interpret the error messages from many
.UX
commands;
In particular,
the messages from \fIcc\fP,
\fIgrep\fP and \fIlint\fP can be understood.
After running the \fIcompile-it\fP command,
the \fIparse-errors\fP command is automatically executed,
and any errors found are displayed in a new buffer.
The files whose names are found in parsing the error messages are each
brought into \s-2JOVE\s0 buffers and the point is positioned at the first error
in the first file.
The commands \fIcurrent-error\fP, C-X C-N (\fInext-error\fP), and
C-X C-P (\fIprevious-error\fP)
can be used to traverse the list of errors.
.LP
If you already have a file called
\fIerrs\fP containing, say, c compiler messages then you can get \s-2JOVE\s0 to interpret the messages by
invoking it as:
.DS I
.I
% jove \-p errs
.R
.DE
.LP
\s-2JOVE\s0 has a special mechanism for checking the the spelling of a document;
It runs the
.UX
spell program into a buffer.
You then delete from this buffer all those words that are not spelling
errors and then \s-2JOVE\s0 runs the \fIparse-spelling-errors\fP command to
yield a list of errors just as in the last section.

C mode

This mode affects the behavior of the tab and parentheses characters.
Instead of just inserting the tab, \s-2JOVE\s0 determines
where the text "ought" to line up for the C language and tabs to that position
instead.  The same thing happens with the close brace and close parenthesis;
they are tabbed to the "right" place and then inserted.
Using the \fIauto-execute-command\fP command, you can make \s-2JOVE\s0 enter
\fIC Mode\fP whenever you edit a file whose name ends in \fI.c\fP.
.NH 3

screen.
.NH 3
Word Abbrev

\*(SN Word Abbrev
.XE
.LP
In this mode, every word you type is compared to a list of word
abbreviations; whenever you type an abbreviation, it is replaced
by the text that it abbreviates.
This can save typing if a particular word or phrase must be entered
many times.
The abbreviations and their expansions are held in a file that looks like:
.DS I
abbrev:phrase
.DE
This file can be set up in your \fI~/.\|joverc\fP with the \fIread-word-abbrev-file\fP command.
Then, whenever you are editing a buffer in \fIWord Abbrev\fP mode,
\s-2JOVE\s0 checks for the abbreviations you've given.
See also the commands
\fIread-word-abbrev-file\fP,
\fIwrite-word-abbrev-file\fP,

Key Re-binding
.XS \n(PN 5n
\*(SN Key Re-binding
.XE
.LP
Many of the commands built into \s-2JOVE\s0 are not bound to
specific keys.
The command handler in
\s-2JOVE\s0 is used to invoke these commands and is activated
by the \fIexecute-extended-command\fP command (ESC X).
When the name of a command typed in is unambiguous,
that command will be executed.
Since it is very slow to have
to type in the name of each command every time it is needed,
\s-2JOVE\s0 makes it possible to \fIbind\fP commands to keys.
When a command is
\fIbound\fP to a key any future hits on that key will invoke that command.
All the printing characters are initially bound to the
command \fIself-insert\fP.
Thus, typing any printing character causes it to be inserted into the text.
Any of the existing commands can be bound to any key.
(A \fIkey\fP may actually be a \fIcontrol character\fP
or an \fIescape sequence\fP as explained previously under
\fICommand Input Conventions\fP).
.LP
Since there are more commands than there are keys,
two keys are treated as \fIprefix\fP commands.
When a key bound to one of the prefix commands is typed,
the next character
typed is interpreted on the basis that it was preceded by one of the
prefix keys.
Initially ^X and ESC are the prefix keys and
many of the built in commands are initially bound to these "two stroke" keys.
(For historical reasons, the Escape key is often referred to as "Meta").
.NH 2
Keyboard Macros
.XS \n(PN 5n
\*(SN Keyboard Macros
.XE
.LP
Although \s-2JOVE\s0 has many powerful commands,
you often find that you have a task that no individual command can do.
\s-2JOVE\s0 allows you to define your own commands from sequences
of existing ones "by example";
Such a sequence is termed a \fImacro\fP.
The procedure is as follows:
First you type the \fIstart-remembering\fP command,
usually bound to C-X (.
Next you "perform" the commands which as they are being executed are
also 
remembered, which will constitute the body of the macro.
Then you give the \fIstop-remembering\fP command, usually bound to
C-X ).
You now have a \fIkeyboard macro\fP.
To run this command sequence again,
use the command \fIexecute-keyboard-macro\fP, usually bound to
C-X E.
You may find this bothersome to type and re-type,
so there is a way to bind the macro to a key.
First,
you must give the keyboard macro a name using the
\fIname-keyboard-macro\fP command.
Then the binding is made with the \fIbind-macro-to-key\fP command.
We're still not finished because all this hard work will be lost
if you leave \s-2JOVE\s0.
What you do is to save your macros into a file
with the \fIwrite-macros-to-file\fP command.
To retrieve your macros in the next editing session (but not their bindings),
you can simply execute the \fIsource\fP command on that file.
.NH 2
Initialization Files
.XS \n(PN 5n
\*(SN Initialization Files
.XE
.LP
Users will likely want to modify the default key bindings to their liking.
Since it would be quite annoying to have to set up the bindings
each time \s-2JOVE\s0 is started up,
\s-2JOVE\s0 has the ability to read in a "startup" file.
Whenever \s-2JOVE\s0 is started,
it reads commands from the file \fI.\|joverc\fP in the user's home directory.
.LP
These commands are read as
if they were typed to the command handler (ESC X) during an edit.
There can be only one command per line in the startup file.
Lines that start with ``#'' are comments.
Lines may be indented.
.LP
Sometimes it is useful for a startup file to do different things in
different circumstances.
To make this possible, there are two conditional commands:
\fIif\fP and \fIifenv\fP.
The \fIif\fP command takes as an operand a shell command, which it runs.
If the command succeeds, the commands after the \fIif\fP, until a line
containing \fIelse\fP or \fIendif\fP, are performed.
Otherwise, these commands are suppressed.
The commands after any \fIelse\fP, up until an \fIendif\fP, are executed
only if the shell command failed.
Conditionals nest in the normal way.
.LP
The \fIifenv\fP command takes as operands the name of an environment variable
and a pattern.
If the environment variable is defined and its value matches the pattern,
the \fIif\fP succeeds.
.LP
If there is a file \fI/usr/lib/jove/joverc\fP,
then this file will be read before the user's
.I .\|joverc
file.
This can be used to set up a system-wide default startup mode for
\s-2JOVE\s0
that is tailored to the needs of that system.
.LP
The \fIsource\fP command can be used to read commands from a specified file
at any time during an editing session,
even from inside the \fI.\|joverc\fP file.
This means that a macro can be used to change the key bindings,
e.g., to enter a mode,
by reading from a specified file which contains all the necessary bindings.
