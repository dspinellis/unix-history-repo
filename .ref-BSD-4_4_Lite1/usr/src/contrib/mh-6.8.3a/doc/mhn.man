       The _m_h_n command manipulates multi-media messages as speci-
       fied in RFC 1521.

       Four action switches direct the operation of  _m_h_n,  namely
       `-list',  `-show',  `-store',  and `-cache'.  Any of these
       switches may be used concurrently.  Normally these  action
       switches  will operate on the content of each of the named
       messages.  However,  by  using  the  `-part'  and  `-type'
       switches,  the  scope  of  the operation can be focused on
       particular subparts (of a multipart content)  and/or  par-
       ticular content types.

       A part specification consists of a series of numbers sepa-
       rated by dots.  For example, in a multipart  content  con-
       taining  three parts, these would be named as 1, 2, and 3,
       respectively.  If part 2 was also a multipart content con-
       taining  two  parts,  these would be named as 2.1 and 2.2,
       respectively.  Note that the `-part' switch  is  effective
       for  only  messages  containing a multipart content.  If a
       message has some other kind of content, or if the part  is
       itself  another multipart content, the `-part' switch will
       not prevent the content from being acted upon.

       A content specification consists of a content type  and  a
       subtype.  The initial list of "standard" content types and

       subtypes can be found in RFC 1521.   A  list  of  commonly
       used contents is briefly reproduced here:

            Type         Subtypes
            ----         --------
            text         plain
            multipart    mixed, alternative, digest, parallel
            message      rfc822, partial, external-body
            application  octet-stream, postscript
            image        jpeg, gif, x-pbm, x-pgm, x-ppm, x-xwd
            audio        basic
            video        mpeg

       Subtypes are mandatory.

       To  specify a content, regardless of its subtype, just use
       the name of the content, e.g., "audio".  To specify a spe-
       cific  subtype,  separate  the  two  with  a  slash, e.g.,
       "audio/basic".  Note that regardless of the  values  given
       to the `-type' switch, a multipart content (of any subtype
       listed above) is always acted upon.  Further note that  if
       the  `-type' switch is used, and it is desirable to act on
       a message/external-body content, then the  `-type'  switch
       must  be  used  twice:  once for message/external-body and
       once for the content externally referenced.

       Each content may optionally have an integrity check  asso-
       ciated  with  it.   If  present and the `-check' switch is
       given, then _m_h_n will attempt to verify  the  integrity  of
       the content.

       The  option  `-file file' directs _m_h_n to use the specified
       file as the source message, rather than a message  from  a
       folder.   Note that the file should be a validly formatted
       message, just like any other _M_H message.  It should NNOOTT be
       in mail drop format (to convert a file in mail drop format
       to a folder of _M_H messages, see _i_n_c (1)).


   LLiissttiinngg tthhee CCoonntteennttss
       The `-list' switch tells _m_h_n to list the table of contents
       associated with the named messages.  The `-headers' switch
       indicates that a one-line banner should be displayed above
       the listing.  The `-realsize' switch tells _m_h_n to evaluate
       the "native" (decoded) format of  each  content  prior  to
       listing.   This  provides an accurate count at the expense
       of a small delay.







[mh.6]                        MH.6.8                            2








MHN(1)                 BSD Reference Manual                MHN(1)


   SShhoowwiinngg tthhee CCoonntteennttss
       The `-show' switch tells _m_h_n to display  the  contents  of
       the  named  messages.  The headers of the message are dis-
       played with the _m_h_l_p_r_o_c, using  format  file  _m_h_l_._h_e_a_d_e_r_s.
       (The  choice  of  format  file  can  be  overridden by the
       `-form formfile' switch.)

       _m_h_n will look for information in  the  user's  profile  to
       determine  how the different contents should be displayed.
       This is accomplished by consulting a display  string,  and
       executing it under //bbiinn//sshh, with the standard input set to
       the  content.   The  display  string  may  contain   these
       escapes:

            %a  additional arguments
            %e  exclusive execution
            %f  filename containing content
            %F  %e, %f, and stdin is terminal not content
            %l  display listing prior to displaying content
            %p  %l, and ask for confirmation
            %s  subtype
            %d  content description

       For  those  display strings containing the e- or F-escape,
       _m_h_n will execute at most one of these at any  given  time.
       Although  the F-escape expands to be the filename contain-
       ing the content, the e-escape has no expansion as  far  as
       the shell is concerned.

       When  the  p-escape  prompts for confirmation, typing INTR
       (usually control-C) will tell _m_h_n not to display that con-
       tent.    (The  p-escape  can  be  disabled  by  specifying
       `-nopause'.)  Further, when _m_h_n is display a content, typ-
       ing  QUIT (usually control-\) will tell _m_h_n to wrap things
       up immediately.

       Note that if the content being displayed is multipart, but
       not  one  of the subtypes listed above, then the f- and F-
       escapes expand to multiple filenames, one for each  subor-
       dinate content.  Further, stdin is not redirected from the
       terminal to the content.

       First, _m_h_n will look for an entry of the form:

            mhn-show-<type>/<subtype>

       to determine the command to use to  display  the  content.
       If  this  isn't  found,  _m_h_n will look for an entry of the
       form:

            mhn-show-<type>



[mh.6]                        MH.6.8                            3








MHN(1)                 BSD Reference Manual                MHN(1)


       to determine the display command.  If  this  isn't  found,
       _m_h_n has two default values:

            mhn-show-text/plain: %pmoreproc '%F'
            mhn-show-message/rfc822: %pshow -file '%F'

       If neither apply, _m_h_n will check to see if the message has
       a   application/octet-stream   content   with    parameter
       "type=tar".   If  so, _m_h_n will use an appropriate command.
       If not, _m_h_n will complain.

       Example entries might be:

            mhn-show-audio/basic: raw2audio 2>/dev/null | play
            mhn-show-image: xv '%f'
            mhn-show-application/PostScript: lpr -Pps

       Note that when using the f- or F-escape, it's a good  idea
       to  use  single-quotes  around  the escape.  This prevents
       misinterpretation by the shell  of  any  funny  characters
       that might be present in the filename.

       Because the text content might be in a non-ASCII character
       set, when _m_h_n encounters a "charset"  parameter  for  this
       content, it checks to see whether the environment variable
       $MM_CHARSET is set and whether the value of this  environ-
       ment variable is equal to the value of the charset parame-
       ter.  If not, then _m_h_n will look for an entry of the form:

            mhn-charset-<charset>

       which  should contain a command creating an environment to
       render the character set.  This command string should con-
       taining  a  single  "%s", which will be filled-in with the
       command to display the content.

       An example entry might be:

            mhn-charset-iso-8859-1:  xterm  -fn   '-*-*-medium-r-
            normal-*-*-120-*-*-c-*-iso8859-*' -e %s

       Note  that  many  pagination  programs strip off the high-
       order bit.  However, newer releases of  the  _l_e_s_s  program
       have  modest support for single-octet character sets.  The
       source to _l_e_s_s version 177, which  has  such  support,  is
       found in the MH source tree under mmiisscceellllaannyy//lleessss--117777.  In
       order to view messages sent in the  ISO  8859/1  character

       set using _l_e_s_s, put these lines in your .login file:

            setenv LESSCHARSET latin1
            setenv LESS "-f"

       The  first  line  tells  _l_e_s_s to use 8859/1 definition for
       determing whether a character is "normal",  "control",  or
       "binary".   The  second line tells _l_e_s_s not to warn you if
       it encounters a file that has non-ASCII characters.  Then,
       simply set the mmoorreepprroocc profile entry to _l_e_s_s, and it will
       get called automatically.  (To handle  other  single-octet
       character  sets,  look  at  the  _l_e_s_s (1) manual entry for
       information about the LLEESSSSCCHHAARRDDEEFF environment variable.)

       Finally, _m_h_n  will  process  each  message  serially -- it
       won't  start  showing  the next message until all the com-
       mands executed to display the current message have  termi-
       nated.  In the case of a multipart content (of any subtype
       listed above), the content contains advice  indicating  if
       the  parts  should  be  displayed serially or in parallel.
       Because this may cause  confusion,  particularly  on  uni-
       window  displays, the `-serialonly' switch can be given to
       tell _m_h_n to never display parts in parallel.


   SSttoorriinngg tthhee CCoonntteennttss
       The `-store' switch tells _m_h_n to store the contents of the
       named  messages  in "native" (decoded) format.  Two things
       must be determined: the directory to  store  the  content,
       and  the  filenames.   Files  are written in the directory
       given by the mmhhnn--ssttoorraaggee profile entry, e.g.,

            mhn-storage: /tmp

       If this entry isn't present, the current working directory
       is used.

       _m_h_n  will  look  for  information in the user's profile to
       determine how the different  contents  should  be  stored.















[mh.6]                        MH.6.8                            5








MHN(1)                 BSD Reference Manual                MHN(1)


       This  is  achieved through the use of a formatting string,
       which may contain these escapes:

            %m  message number
            %P  .part
            %p  part
            %s  subtype

       If the content isn't part of a multipart (of  any  subtype
       listed  above)  content,  the p-escapes are ignored.  Note
       that if the formatting string starts with a "+" character,
       then  these escapes are ignored, and the content is stored
       in the named  folder.   (A  formatting  string  consisting
       solely  of  a "+" character indicates the current folder.)
       Further, a formatting string consisting solely  of  a  "-"
       character indicates the standard-output.

       First, _m_h_n will look for an entry of the form:

            mhn-store-<type>/<subtype>

       to  determine the formatting string.  If this isn't found,
       _m_h_n will look for an entry of the form:

            mhn-store-<type>

       to determine the formatting string.  If this isn't  found,
       _m_h_n will check to see if the content is application/octet-
       stream with parameter "type=tar".  If so, _m_h_n will  choose
       an  appropriate  filename.  If the content is not applica-
       tion/octet-stream, then _m_h_n will check to see if the  con-
       tent is a message.  If so, _m_h_n will use the value "+".  If
       not, _m_h_n will use the value "%m%P.%s".

       Note that if the formatting string starts with a '/', then
       content will be stored in the full path given (rather than
       using the value of  mmhhnn--ssttoorraaggee  or  the  current  working
       directory.)   Similarly,  if  the formatting string starts
       with a '|', then _m_h_n will execute a command  which  should
       ultimately  store the content.  Note that before executing
       the command, _m_h_n will change to the appropriate directory.
       Also note that if the formatting string starts with a '|',
       then _m_h_n will also honor the a-escape when processing  the
       formatting string.










[mh.6]                        MH.6.8                            6








MHN(1)                 BSD Reference Manual                MHN(1)


       Example entries might be:

            mhn-store-text: %m%P.txt
            mhn-store-audio/basic: | raw2audio -e ulaw -s 8000 -c 1 > %m%P.au
            mhn-store-application/PostScript: %m%P.ps

       Further,  note that when asked to store a content contain-
       ing a partial message, _m_h_n will try to locate all  of  the
       portions and combine them accordingly.  Thus, if someone's
       sent you a message in several parts, you  might  put  them
       all in their own folder and do:

            mhn all -store

       This will store exactly one message, containing the sum of
       the parts.  Note that if _m_h_n can not locate each part,  it
       will not store anything.

       Finally,  if  the  `-auto' switch is given and the content
       contains information indicating the filename  the  content
       should  be  stored  as  (and if the filename doesn't begin
       with a '/'), then the filename from the  content  will  be
       used instead.


   EExxtteerrnnaall AAcccceessss
       For  contents  of type message/external-body, _m_h_n supports
       these access-types:

            afs
            anon-ftp
            ftp
            local-file
            mail-server

       For the "anon-ftp" and "ftp" access types, if your  system
       supports  a SOCKETs interface to TCP/IP, then _m_h_n will use
       a built-in FTP client.  Otherwise, _m_h_n will look  for  the
       mmhhnn--aacccceessss--ffttpp profile entry, e.g.,

       retrieval.  This program is invoked with these arguments:

            domain name of FTP-site
            username
            password
            remote directory
            remote filename
            local filename
            "ascii" or "binary"

       The program should  terminate  with  a  zero-valued  exit-
       status if the retrieval is successful.

       When _m_h_n encounters an external content containing a "Con-
       tent-ID:" field, and if the content allows  caching,  then
       depending  on  the  caching  behavior  of _m_h_n, the content
       might be read from or written to a cache.

       The  caching  behavior  of  _m_h_n  is  controlled  with  the
       `-rcache'  and `-wcache' switches, which define the policy
       for reading from, and writing to, the cache, respectively.
       One  of four policies may be specified: "public", indicat-
       ing that _m_h_n should make use  of  a  publically-accessible
       content  cache; "private", indicating that _m_h_n should make
       use of the user's private content cache; "never", indicat-
       ing that _m_h_n should never make use of caching; and, "ask",
       indicating that _m_h_n should ask the user.

       There are two directories where contents  may  be  cached:
       the  profile  entry mmhhnn--ccaacchhee names a directory containing
       world-readable  contents,  and,  the  profile  entry  mmhhnn--
       pprriivvaattee--ccaacchhee  names  a  directory containing private con-
       tents.  The former should be an absolute  (rooted)  direc-
       tory name.  For example,

            mhn-cache: /tmp

       might  be used if you didn't care that the cache got wiped
       after each reboot of the system.   The  latter  is  inter-
       preted relative to the user's MH directory, if not rooted,
       e.g.,

            mhn-private-cache: .cache

       (which is the default value).

       send a message to a mail-server  requesting  the  content,
       e.g.,

            % show 1
            Retrieve content by asking mail-server@...

            SEND file

            ? yes
            mhn: request sent

       Regardless  of  your decision, _m_h_n can't perform any other
       processing on the content.

       However, if _m_h_n is allowed to request  the  content,  then
       when it arrives, there should be a top-level "Content-ID:"
       field which corresponds to the value in the original  mes-
       sage/external-body   content.   You  should  now  use  the
       `-cache' switch to tell _m_h_n to enter the arriving  content
       into the content cache, e.g.,

            % mhn -cache 2
            caching message 2 as file ...

       You can then re-process the original message/external-body
       content, and "the right thing should happen", e.g.,

            % show 1
             ...

       The _m_h_n program can also be used as a simple editor to aid
       in  composing  multi-media  messages.   When  invoked by a
       _w_h_a_t_n_o_w program, _m_h_n will expect the body of the draft  to
       be formatted as an "_m_h_n composition file."

               line         ::=     "##" text EOL
                                    -- interpreted as "#"text EOL
                                  | text EOL

       Basically, the body contains one or more contents.  A con-
       tent consists of either a directive, indicated with a  "#"
       as  the  first  character of a line; or, plaintext (one or
       more lines of text).  The continuation character, "\", may
       be used to enter a single directive on more than one line,
       e.g.,

            #@application/octet-stream; \
                type=tar; \
                x-conversions=compress

       There are four kinds  of  directives:  "type"  directives,
       which name the type and subtype of the content; "external-
       type" directives, which also name the type and subtype  of
       the  content;  the "forw" directive, which is used to for-
       ward a digest of messages;  and,  the  "begin"  directive,
       which is used to create a multipart content.

       For  the  type directives, the user may optionally specify
       the name of a file containing  the  contents  in  "native"
       (decoded)  format.   (If  the filename starts with the "|"
       character, then this gives a command whose output is  cap-
       tured  accordingly.)  If a filename is not given, _m_h_n will
       look for information in the user's  profile  to  determine
       how  the  different  contents should be composed.  This is
       accomplished by consulting a composition string, and  exe-
       cuting  it  under //bbiinn//sshh, with the standard output set to
       the content.  The composition  string  may  contain  these
       escapes:

            %a  additional arguments
            %f  filename containing content
            %F  %f, and stdout is not re-directed
            %s  subtype

       First, _m_h_n will look for an entry of the form:

            mhn-compose-<type>/<subtype>

       to  determine  the  command to use to compose the content.
       If this isn't found, _m_h_n will look for  an  entry  of  the
       form:

            mhn-compose-<type>

       to  determine  the  composition  command.   If  this isn't
       found, _m_h_n will complain.



[mh.6]                        MH.6.8                           11








MHN(1)                 BSD Reference Manual                MHN(1)


       An example entry might be:

            mhn-compose-audio/basic: record | raw2audio -F

       Because commands like these will vary,  depending  on  the
       display  environment  used  for login, composition strings
       for different contents should probably be put in the  file
       specified  by  the  $$MMHHNN  environment variable, instead of
       directly in your user profile.

       The external-type directives are used to provide a  refer-
       ence  to  a  content,  rather  than enclosing the contents
       itself.  Hence, instead of providing a  filename  as  with
       the  type  directives,  external-parameters  are supplied.
       These look like regular parameters, so they must be  sepa-
       rated accordingly, e.g.,

            #@application/octet-stream; \
                type=tar; \
                x-conversions=compress [] \
                access-type=anon-ftp; \
                name="mh-mime.tar.Z"; \
                directory="mrose/mh-mime"; \
                site="ftp.ics.uci.edu"

       By  specifying "[]", an empty description string is given,
       and the start of the  external-parameters  is  identified.
       These parameters are of the form:

            access-type=  usually _a_n_o_n_-_f_t_p or _m_a_i_l_-_s_e_r_v_e_r
            name=         filename
            permission=   read-only or read-write
            site=         hostname
            directory=    directoryname (optional)
            mode=         usually _a_s_c_i_i or _i_m_a_g_e (optional)
            size=         number of octets
            server=       mailbox
            subject=      subject to send
            body=         command to send for retrieval


       For  the  forw  directive, the user may optionally specify
       the name of the folder and which messages are to  be  for-
       warded.  if a folder is not given, it defaults to the cur-
       rent folder.  Similarly, if a message  is  not  given,  it
       defaults  to  the current message.  Hence, the forw direc-
       tive is similar to the _f_o_r_w (1) command, except  that  the
       former  uses  the MIME rules for encapsulation rather than
       those specified in RFC 934.  Usage  of  the  `-rfc934mode'
       switch indicates whether _m_h_n should attempt to utilize the
       encapsulation rules in such a way as to  appear  that  RFC



[mh.6]                        MH.6.8                           12








MHN(1)                 BSD Reference Manual                MHN(1)


       934 is being used.  If given, then RFC 934-compliant user-
       agents  should  be  able   to   burst   the   message   on
       reception -- providing  that  the  messages being encapsu-
       lated do not  contain  encapsulated  messages  themselves.
       The  drawback  of this approach is that the encapsulations
       are generated by placing an extra newline at  the  end  of
       the body of each message.

       For  the  begin  directive, the user must specify at least
       one content between the begin and end pairs.

       For all of these directives, the user may include a  brief
       description  of  the content between the "[" character and
       the "]" character.  By default, _m_h_n will generate a unique
       "Content-ID:"  for  each  directive; however, the user may
       override this by defining the ID using  the  "<"  and  ">"
       characters.   Putting  this  all together, here is a brief
       example of what a user's components file might look like:

            To:
            cc:
            Subject:
            --------
            #audio/basic [Flint phone]  \
                |raw2audio -F < /home/mrose/lib/multi-media/flint.au
            #image/gif   [MTR's photo] \
                                /home/mrose/lib/multi-media/mrose.gif

       For a later example, we'll call this components file  _m_h_n_-
       _c_o_m_p_s.

       As noted earlier, in addition to directives, plaintext can
       be present.  Plaintext is gathered, until a  directive  is
       found  or the draft is exhausted, and this is made to form
       a text content.  If the plaintext must contain  a  "#"  at
       the beginning of a line, simply double it, e.g.,

            ##when sent, this line will start with only one #

       If  you  want  to  end the plaintext prior to a directive,
       e.g., to have  two  plaintext  contents  adjacent,  simply
       insert a line containing a single "#" character, e.g.,

            this is the first content
            #
            and this is the second

       Finally, if the plaintext starts with a line of the form:

            Content-Description: text




[mh.6]                        MH.6.8                           13








MHN(1)                 BSD Reference Manual                MHN(1)


       then  this will be used to describe the plaintext content.
       NNOOTTEE WWEELLLL:: you must follow this line  with  a  blank  line
       before starting your text.

       By default, plaintext is captured as a text/plain content.
       You can override this by starting the plaintext with  "#<"
       followed by a content-type specification, e.g.,

            #<text/richtext
            this content will be tagged as text/richtext
            #
            and this content will be tagged as text/plain

       Note  that  if  you  use the "#<" plaintext-form, then the
       content-description must be on the same line which identi-
       fies the content type of the plaintext.

       If  _m_h_n  is  successful,  it renames the original draft to
       start with the ","  character  and  end  with  the  string
       ".orig",  e.g.,  if  you  are editing the file "draft", it
       will be renamed to ",draft.orig".  This allows you to eas-
       ily recover the _m_h_n composition file.

       If  the  `-check'  switch  is given, _m_h_n will associate an
       integrity check with each content.

       Note that MH will not invoke _m_h_n automatically, unless you
       add this line to your .mh_profile file:

       Otherwise, you must specifically give the command

       You  can easily tailor MH to help you remember to do this.

       ning _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l and expect to generate a lot of partial mes-
       sages.  If the first argument given to _v_i_a_m_a_i_l starts with
       a dash, then it is interpreted as the number of seconds to
       pause in between postings, e.g.,

            /usr/contrib/mh-6.8/lib/viamail  -300  mailpath "sub-
            ject" files ...

       will pause 5 minutes in between each posting.

       When these messages are received, invoke  _m_h_n  once,  with
       the  list  of messages, and the `-store' command.  The _m_h_n
       program will then store exactly one message containing the
       archive.   You  can  then  use  `-show' to find out what's
       inside;  possibly   followed  by  `-store'  to  write  the
       archive  to  a  file where you can subsequently uncompress
       and untar it, e.g.,

            % mhn -list all
             msg part  type/subtype             size description
               1       message/partial           47K part 1 of 4
               2       message/partial           47K part 2 of 4
               3       message/partial           47K part 3 of 4
               4       message/partial           18K part 4 of 4
            % mhn -store all
            % mhn -list -verbose last
             msg part  type/subtype             size description

                         type=tar
                         x-conversions=compress
            % mhn -show last
             msg part  type/subtype             size description

       matically do the extraction for you, e.g.,

            % mhn -list all
             msg part  type/subtype             size description
               1       message/partial           47K part 1 of 4
               2       message/partial           47K part 2 of 4
               3       message/partial           47K part 3 of 4
               4       message/partial           18K part 4 of 4
            % mhn -store all
            % mhn -list -verbose last
             msg part  type/subtype             size description
               5       application/octet-stream 118K
                         (extract with uncompress | tar xvpf -)
                         type=tar
                         x-conversions=compress
            % mhn -show last
             msg part  type/subtype             size description
               5       application/octet-stream 118K
            -- headers of message, followed by _t_a_r listing appears here
            % mhn -store -auto last
            -- _t_a_r listing appears here as files are extracted

       As  the  second  _t_a_r  listing  is generated, the files are
       extracted.  A prudent user will never put `-auto'  in  the
       .mh_profile  file.   The correct procedure is to first use
       `-show', to find out what will be extracted.  Then _m_h_n can
       be  invoked  with   `-store'  and  `-auto'  to perform the
       extraction.

       Because the display environment in which _m_h_n operates  may
       vary  for  a user, _m_h_n will look for the environment vari-
       able $$MMHHNN.  If present, this  specifies  the  name  of  an
       additional user profile which should be read.  Hence, when
       a user logs in on a particular display device, this  envi-
       ronment variable should be set to refer to a file contain-
       ing definitions useful for the display device.   Normally,
       only entries of the form

            mhn-show-<type>/<subtype>
            mhn-show-<type>

       need be present.  Finally, _m_h_n will attempt to consult one
       other additional user profile, e.g.,

            /usr/contrib/mh-6.8/lib/mhn_defaults

       which is created automatically during MH installation.
