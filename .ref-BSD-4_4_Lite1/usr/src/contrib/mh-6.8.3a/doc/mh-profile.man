DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Each  user  of  _M_H  is  expected  to  have  a  file  named
       _._m_h___p_r_o_f_i_l_e  in his or her home directory.  This file con-
       tains a set of user parameters used by some or all of  the
       _M_H  family  of  programs.  Each line of the file is of the
       format

           _p_r_o_f_i_l_e_-_c_o_m_p_o_n_e_n_t: _v_a_l_u_e

       The possible profile  components  are  exemplified  below.
       Only  `Path:' is mandatory.  The others are optional; some
       have default values if they are not present.  In the nota-
       tion  used below, (profile, default) indicates whether the
       information is kept in the user's _M_H profile  or  _M_H  con-
       text, and indicates what the default value is.

       Path: Mail
                 Locates  _M_H  transactions  in  directory "Mail".
                 (profile, no default)

       context: context
                 Declares the location of the  _M_H  context  file,
                 see   the   HHIISSTTOORRYY  section  below.   (profile,
                 default: <mh-dir>/context)

       Current-Folder: inbox
                 Keeps track of the current open  folder.   (con-
                 text, default: folder specified by "Inbox")

       Inbox:    inbox
                 Defines  the  name  of  your  inbox.   (profile,
                 default: inbox)

       Previous-Sequence: pseq
                 Names the sequences which should be  defined  as
                 the  `msgs'  or `msg' argument given to the pro-
                 gram.  If not present, or  empty,  no  sequences
                 are  defined.   Otherwise,  for each name given,
                 the sequence is first zero'd and then each  mes-
                 sage  is  added  to  the sequence.  (profile, no
                 default)

       Sequence-Negation: not
                 Defines the string which,  when  prefixed  to  a

                 sequence  name,  negates  that sequence.  Hence,
                 "notseen" means all those messages that are  not
                 a  member  of the sequence "seen".  (profile, no
                 default)

       Unseen-Sequence: unseen
                 Names the sequences which should be  defined  as
                 those  messages  recently  incorporated  by _i_n_c.
                 _S_h_o_w knows to remove messages from this sequence
                 once it thinks they have been seen.  If not pre-
                 sent, or empty, no sequences are defined.   Oth-
                 erwise,  each  message is added to each sequence
                 name given.  (profile, no default)

       mh-sequences: .mh_sequences
                 The name  of  the  file  in  each  folder  which
                 defines public sequences.  To disable the use of
                 public sequences, leave  the  value  portion  of
                 this    entry    blank.     (profile,   default:
                 .mh_sequences)

       atr-_s_e_q-_f_o_l_d_e_r: 172 178-181 212
                 Keeps track of the private sequence  called  _s_e_q
                 in the specified folder.  (context, no default)

       Editor: /usr/ucb/ex
                 Defines editor to be used by _c_o_m_p (1), _d_i_s_t (1),
                 _f_o_r_w (1),  and  _r_e_p_l (1).   (profile,   default:
                 prompter)

       Msg-Protect: 644
                 Defines octal protection bits for message files.
                 See _c_h_m_o_d (1) for an explanation  of  the  octal
                 number.  (profile, default: 0644)

       Folder-Protect: 711
                 Defines  protection bits for folder directories.
                 (profile, default: 0711)

       _p_r_o_g_r_a_m: default switches
                 Sets default switches to be used whenever the mh
                 program  _p_r_o_g_r_a_m  is  invoked.  For example, one
                 could override  the  _E_d_i_t_o_r:  profile  component
                 when  replying to messages by adding a component
                 such as:
                      repl: -editor /bin/ed
                 (profile, no defaults)

       _l_a_s_t_e_d_i_t_o_r-next: nexteditor
                 Names "nexteditor"  to  be  the  default  editor
                 after  using "lasteditor".  This takes effect at

                 "What now?" level in _c_o_m_p, _d_i_s_t, _f_o_r_w, and _r_e_p_l.
                 After  editing  the draft with "lasteditor", the
                 default editor is set to  be  "nexteditor".   If
                 the  user  types "edit" without any arguments to
                 "What now?", then "nexteditor" is  used.   (pro-
                 file, no default)

       bboards: system
                 Tells  _b_b_c  which BBoards you are interested in.
                 (profile, default: system)

       Folder-Stack: _f_o_l_d_e_r_s
                 The contents of the folder-stack for the  _f_o_l_d_e_r
                 command.  (context, no default)

       mhe:
                 If  present,  tells _i_n_c to compose an _M_H_E audit-
                 file in addition to its  other  tasks.   _M_H_E  is
                 Brian  Reid's  _E_m_a_c_s front-end for _M_H.  An early
                 version is supplied with the _m_h_._6  distribution.
                 (profile, no default)

       Alternate-Mailboxes: mh@uci-750a, bug-mh*
                 Tells  _r_e_p_l  and _s_c_a_n which addresses are really
                 yours.  In this way, _r_e_p_l knows which  addresses
                 should  be included in the reply, and _s_c_a_n knows
                 if  the  message  really  originated  from  you.
                 Addresses  must be separated by a comma, and the
                 hostnames listed should be the "official"  host-
                 names  for  the mailboxes you indicate, as local
                 nicknames for hosts are not replaced with  their
                 official  site  names.   For  each address, if a
                 host is not given, then that address on any host
                 is considered to be you.  In addition, an aster-
                 isk (`*') may appear at either or both  ends  of
                 the  mailbox  and  host  to  indicate  wild-card
                 matching.  (profile, default: your user-id)

       Aliasfile: aliases other-alias
                 Indicates aliases files for _a_l_i, _w_h_o_m, and _s_e_n_d.
                 This  may  be  used instead of the `-alias file'
                 switch.  (profile, no default)

       Draft-Folder: drafts
                 Indicates a default draft folder for _c_o_m_p, _d_i_s_t,
                 _f_o_r_w, and _r_e_p_l.  (profile, no default)

       digest-issue-_l_i_s_t: 1
                 Tells  _f_o_r_w  the  last  issue of the last volume
                 sent for the digest _l_i_s_t.  (context, no default)

       digest-volume-_l_i_s_t: 1
                 Tells  _f_o_r_w  the last volume sent for the digest
                 _l_i_s_t.  (context, no default)

       MailDrop: .mail
                 Tells _i_n_c your maildrop, if different  from  the
                 default.   This  is  superceded  by the MMAAIILLDDRROOPP
                 envariable.  (profile, default: /var/mail/$USER)

       Signature: RAND MH System (agent: Marshall Rose)
                 Tells   _s_e_n_d   your  mail  signature.   This  is
                 superceded by the SSIIGGNNAATTUURREE envariable.  If SSIIGG--
                 NNAATTUURREE  is not set and this profile entry is not
                 present, the "gcos"  field  of  the  _/_e_t_c_/_p_a_s_s_w_d
                 file  will be used; otherwise, on hosts where _M_H
                 was configured with the  UCI  option,  the  file
                 $HOME/.signature  is  consulted.  Your signature
                 will be added to the address _s_e_n_d  puts  in  the
                 "From:" header; do not include an address in the
                 signature text.  (profile, no default)

       The following profile elements are  used  whenever  an  _M_H
       program  invokes some other program such as _m_o_r_e (1).  The
       _._m_h___p_r_o_f_i_l_e can be used to select  alternate  programs  if
       the  user  wishes.   The  default  values are given in the
       examples.

       If you define the envariable MMHH, you can specify a profile
       other  than _._m_h___p_r_o_f_i_l_e to be read by the _M_H programs that
       you invoke.  If the value of MMHH is  not  absolute,  (i.e.,
       does  not  begin  with a // ), it will be presumed to start
       from the current working directory.  This is  one  of  the
       very few exceptions in _M_H where non-absolute pathnames are
       not considered relative to the user's _M_H directory.

MH-PROFILE(5)        BSD Programmer's Manual        MH-PROFILE(5)


       Similarly, if you define the envariable MMHHCCOONNTTEEXXTT, you can
       specify  a  context other than the normal context file (as
       specified in the _M_H profile).  As always, unless the value
       of  MMHHCCOONNTTEEXXTT  is  absolute,  it will be presumed to start
       from your _M_H directory.

       _M_H programs also support other envariables:

       MMAAIILLDDRROOPP : tells _i_n_c the default maildrop
            This supercedes the "MailDrop:" profile entry.

       SSIIGGNNAATTUURREE : tells _s_e_n_d and _p_o_s_t your mail signature
            This supercedes the "Signature:" profile entry.

       HHOOMMEE : tells all _M_H programs your home directory

       SSHHEELLLL : tells _b_b_l the default shell to run

       TTEERRMM : tells _M_H your terminal type
            The TTEERRMMCCAAPP envariable is also consulted.  In partic-
            ular,  these tell _s_c_a_n and _m_h_l how to clear your ter-
            minal, and how many columns wide  your  terminal  is.
            They  also tell _m_h_l how many lines long your terminal
            screen is.

       eeddiittaalltt : the alternate message
            This is set by _d_i_s_t and _r_e_p_l during edit sessions  so
            you  can  peruse  the  message  being  distributed or
            replied to.  The message is also available through  a
            link called "@" in the current directory if your cur-
            rent working directory and  the  folder  the  message
            lives in are on the same UNIX filesystem.

       mmhhddrraafftt : the path to the working draft
            This is set by _c_o_m_p, _d_i_s_t, _f_o_r_w, and _r_e_p_l to tell the
            _w_h_a_t_n_o_w_p_r_o_c which file to ask "What  now?"  questions
            about.    In  addition,  _d_i_s_t,  _f_o_r_w,  and  _r_e_p_l  set
            mmhhffoollddeerr if appropriate.  Further, _d_i_s_t and _r_e_p_l  set
            mmhhaallttmmssgg  to  tell the _w_h_a_t_n_o_w_p_r_o_c about an alternate
            message associated with the draft (the message  being
            distributed  or  replied to), and _d_i_s_t sets mmhhddiisstt to
            tell the _w_h_a_t_n_o_w_p_r_o_c that message re-distribution  is
            occurring.   Also,  mmhheeddiittoorr is set to tell the _w_h_a_t_-
            _n_o_w_p_r_o_c the user's choice of editor (unless  overrid-
            den  by  `-noedit').   Similarly, mmhhuussee may be set by
            _c_o_m_p.  Finally, mmhhmmeessssaaggeess is set by _d_i_s_t, _f_o_r_w,  and
            _r_e_p_l  if annotations are to occur (along with mmhhaannnnoo--
            ttaattee, and mmhhiinnppllaaccee).  It's amazing all the  informa-
            tion  that  has to get passed via envariables to make
            the "What now?" interface look squeaky clean  to  the
            _M_H  user,  isn't it?  The reason for all this is that

            the _M_H user can select _a_n_y program  as  the  _w_h_a_t_n_o_w_-
            _p_r_o_c,  including  one  of  the standard shells.  As a
            result, it's not possible to pass information via  an
            argument list.
            If the WHATNOW option was set during _M_H configuration
            (type `-help' to an _M_H command to find out),  and  if
            this envariable is set, if the commands _r_e_f_i_l_e, _s_e_n_d,
            _s_h_o_w, or _w_h_o_m are not  given  any  `msgs'  arguments,
            then they will default to using the file indicated by
            mmhhddrraafftt.  This is  useful  for  getting  the  default
            behavior supplied by the default _w_h_a_t_n_o_w_p_r_o_c.

       mmhhffoollddeerr : the folder containing the alternate message
            This  is set by _d_i_s_t and _r_e_p_l during edit sessions so
            you can peruse other messages in the  current  folder
            besides the one being distributed or replied to.  The
            mmhhffoollddeerr envariable is also set by  _s_h_o_w,  _p_r_e_v,  and
            _n_e_x_t for use by _m_h_l.

       MMHHBBBBRRCC :
            If  you define the envariable MMHHBBBBRRCC, you can specify
            a BBoards information file other  than  _._b_b_r_c  to  be
            read by _b_b_c.  If the value of MMHHBBBBRRCC is not absolute,
            (i.e., does not begin with a // ), it will be presumed
            to start from the current working directory.

       MMHHFFDD :
            If  the  OVERHEAD option was set during _M_H configura-
            tion (type `-help' to an _M_H  command  to  find  out),
            then if this envariable is set, _M_H considers it to be
            the number of a  file  descriptor  which  is  opened,
            read-only  to  the  _M_H  profile.   Similarly,  if the
            envariable MMHHCCOONNTTEEXXTTFFDD is set, this is the number  of
            a file descriptor which is opened read-only to the _M_H
            context.  This feature of _M_H is experimental, and  is
            used  to  examine  possible speed improvements for _M_H
            startup.  Note that these envariables must be set and
            non-empty  to enable this feature.  However, if OVER-
            HEAD is enabled during _M_H configuration, then when _M_H
            programs call other _M_H programs, this scheme is used.
            These file descriptors are not closed throughout  the
            execution  of  the  _M_H  program, so children may take
            advantage of this.  This approach is  thought  to  be
            completely  safe  and does result in some performance
            enhancements.

       In previous versions of _M_H, the current-message value of a
       writable  folder  was  kept  in a file called "cur" in the
       folder itself.  In _m_h_._3,  the  _._m_h___p_r_o_f_i_l_e  contained  the
       current-message  values  for  all  folders,  regardless of
       their writability.

       In all versions of _M_H since _m_h_._4, the _._m_h___p_r_o_f_i_l_e contains
       only  static  information,  which  _M_H  programs  will  NNOOTT
       update.  Changes in context are made to the  _c_o_n_t_e_x_t  file
       kept in the users MH _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y.  This includes, but is not
       limited to: the "Current-Folder"  entry  and  all  private
       sequence information.  Public sequence information is kept
       in a file called _._m_h___s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e_s in each folder.

       To convert from the format used in releases of _M_H prior to
       the  format used in the _m_h_._4 release, _i_n_s_t_a_l_l_-_m_h should be
       invoked with the `-compat' switch.  This generally happens
       automatically  on  _M_H  systems generated with the "COMPAT"
       option during _M_H configuration.

       The _._m_h___p_r_o_f_i_l_e may override the path of the _c_o_n_t_e_x_t file,
       by  specifying  a  "context" entry (this must be in lower-
       case).  If the entry is not absolute (does not start  with
       a  // ),  then  it is interpreted relative to the user's _M_H
       directory.  As a result, you can actually have  more  than
       one  set  of  private sequences by using different context
       files.

       The shell quoting conventions are  not  available  in  the
       .mh_profile.  Each token is separated by whitespace.

       There is some question as to what kind of arguments should
       be placed in the profile as options.  In order to  provide
       a  clear  answer,  recall command line semantics of all _M_H

       programs:  conflicting  switches   (e.g.,   `-header   and
       `-noheader')  may  occur more than one time on the command
       line, with the last switch  taking  effect.   Other  argu-
       ments,  such  as message sequences, filenames and folders,
       are always remembered on the invocation line and  are  not
       superseded  by  following  arguments  of  the  same  type.
       Hence, it is safe to place only switches (and their  argu-
       ments) in the profile.

       If one finds that an _M_H program is being invoked again and
       again with the same arguments, and those arguments  aren't
       switches,  then there are a few possible solutions to this
       problem.  The first is to create a  (soft)  link  in  your
       _$_H_O_M_E_/_b_i_n  directory to the _M_H program of your choice.  By
       giving this link a different name, you can  create  a  new
       entry in your profile and use an alternate set of defaults
       for the _M_H command.  Similarly, you could create  a  small
       shell  script  which  called the _M_H program of your choice
       with an alternate set of invocation line  switches  (using
       links and an alternate profile entry is preferable to this
       solution).

       Finally, the _c_s_h user could create an alias for  the  com-
       mand of the form:

            alias cmd 'cmd arg1 arg2 ...'

       In  this  way,  the  user can avoid lengthy type-in to the
       shell, and still give _M_H commands  safely.   (Recall  that
       some _M_H commands invoke others, and that in all cases, the
       profile is read,  meaning  that  aliases  are  disregarded
       beyond an initial command invocation)
