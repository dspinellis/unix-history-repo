\fIPost\fR is the program called by \fIsend\fR\0(1)
to deliver the message in \fIfile\fR to local and remote users.
In fact, all of the functions attributed to \fIsend\fR
on its manual page are performed by \fIpost\fR,
with \fIsend\fR acting as a relatively simple preprocessor.
Thus, it is \fIpost\fR which parses the various header fields,
appends From: and Date: lines,
and interacts with the \fISendMail\fR transport system.
\fIPost\fR will not normally be called directly by the user.

\fIPost\fR
searches the \*(lqTo:\*(rq, \*(lqcc:\*(rq, \*(lqBcc:\*(rq, \*(lqFcc:\*(rq, and \*(lqResent\-xxx:\*(rq
header lines of
the specified message for destination addresses, checks these
addresses for validity, and formats them so as to conform to 
ARPAnet Internet Message Format protocol,
unless the `\-noformat' flag is set.
This will normally cause \*(lq@\fIlocal\-site\fR\*(rq to
be appended to each local destination address, as well
as any local return addresses.  
The `\-width\ columns' switch can be used to indicate the preferred length
of the header components that contain addresses.

If a \*(lqBcc:\*(rq field is encountered,
its addresses will be used for delivery,
and the \*(lqBcc:\*(rq field will be removed from the message sent to sighted
recipients.
The blind recipients will receive an entirely new message with
a minimal set of headers.
Included in the body of the message will be a copy of the message sent to the
sighted recipients.
If `\-filter\ filterfile' is specified,
then this copy is filtered (re\-formatted)
prior to being sent to the blind recipients.
Otherwise,
to use the MIME rules for encapsulation,
specify the `\-mime' switch.

The `\-alias\ aliasfile' switch can be used to specify a file that post should
take aliases from.  More than one file can be specified, each being preceded
with `\-alias'.
In any event,
the primary alias file is read first.

The `\-msgid' switch indicates that
a \*(lqMessage\-ID:\*(rq or \*(lqResent\-Message\-ID:\*(rq
field should be added to the header.

The `\-verbose' switch indicates that the user should be informed of each
step of the posting/filing process.

The `\-watch' switch indicates that the user would like to watch the transport
system's handling of the message (e.g., local and \*(lqfast\*(rq delivery).

\fIPost\fR consults the envariable \fB$SIGNATURE\fR to
determine the sender's personal name in constructing the \*(lqFrom:\*(rq line
of the message.
