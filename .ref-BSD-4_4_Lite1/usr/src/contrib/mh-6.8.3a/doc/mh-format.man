       some _M_H commands

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Several  _M_H  commands  utilize either a _f_o_r_m_a_t string or a
       _f_o_r_m_a_t file during their execution.  For example, _s_c_a_n (1)
       uses  a format string which directs it how to generate the
       scan listing for each message; _r_e_p_l (1) uses a format file
       which  directs  it how to generate the reply to a message,
       and so on.

       Format strings are designed to be efficiently parsed by _M_H
       which  means  they are not necessarily simple to write and
       understand.  This  means  that  novice,  casual,  or  even
       advanced  users  of  _M_H should not have to deal with them.
       Some    canned    scan    listing    formats    are     in
       /usr/contrib/mh-6.8/lib/scan.time,
       /usr/contrib/mh-6.8/lib/scan.size,                     and
       /usr/contrib/mh-6.8/lib/scan.timely.         Look       in
       /usr/contrib/mh-6.8/lib for other  _s_c_a_n  and  _r_e_p_l  format
       files which may have been written at your site.

       It  suffices  to  have your local _M_H expert actually write
       new format commands or modify existing ones.  This  manual
       section  explains  how to do that.  Note: familiarity with
       the C _p_r_i_n_t_f routine is assumed.

       A format string consists of  ordinary  text,  and  special
       multi-character  _e_s_c_a_p_e  sequences  which  begin with `%'.
       When specifying a format string,  the  usual  C  backslash
       characters  are honored: `\b', `\f', `\n', `\r', and `\t'.
       Continuation lines in format files end with  `\'  followed
       by the newline character.  There are three types of _e_s_c_a_p_e
       sequences: header _c_o_m_p_o_n_e_n_t_s, built-in _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n_s, and flow
       _c_o_n_t_r_o_l.

       A  _c_o_m_p_o_n_e_n_t  escape  is  specified as `%{_c_o_m_p_o_n_e_n_t}', and
       exists for each header found in  the  message  being  pro-
       cessed.  For example `%{date}' refers to the "Date:" field
       of the appropriate message.  All component escapes have  a
       string  value.   Normally, component values are compressed
       by converting any  control  characters  (tab  and  newline
       included)  to spaces, then eliding any leading or multiple
       spaces.  However, commands may give different  interpreta-
       tions  to some component escapes; be sure to refer to each
       command's manual entry for complete details.

       A _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n escape  is  specified  as  `%(_f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n)'.   All

       functions  are built-in, and most have a string or numeric
       value.

       A _c_o_n_t_r_o_l escape is one of: `%<',  `%?',  `%|',  or  `%>'.
       These  are  combined  into  the conditional execution con-
       struct:

            %<condition
                 _f_o_r_m_a_t _t_e_x_t _1
            %?condition2
                 _f_o_r_m_a_t _t_e_x_t _2
            %?condition3
                 _f_o_r_m_a_t _t_e_x_t _3
            ...
            %|
                 _f_o_r_m_a_t _t_e_x_t _N
            %>

       Extra white space is shown here only for  clarity.   These
       constructs  may  be nested without ambiguity.  They form a
       general iiff--eellsseeiiff--eellssee--eennddiiff block where only one  of  the
       _f_o_r_m_a_t _t_e_x_t segments is interpreted.

       The `%<' and `%?' control escapes causes a condition to be
       evaluated.  This condition may be either a _c_o_m_p_o_n_e_n_t or  a
       _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n.  The four constructs have the following syntax:

            %<{component}
            %<(function)
            %?{component}
            %?(function)

       These  control escapes test whether the function or compo-
       nent value is non-zero (for  integer-valued  escapes),  or
       non-empty (for string-valued escapes).

       If  this  test  evaulates true, then the format text up to
       the next corresponding control escape (one of `%|',  `%?',
       or  `%>')  is interpreted normally.  Next, all format text
       (if any) up to the corresponding `%>'  control  escape  is
       skipped.  The `%>' control escape is not interpreted; nor-
       mal interpretation resumes after the `%>' escape.

       If the test evaluates false, however, then the format text
       up to the next corresponding control escape (again, one of
       `%|', `%?', or `%>') is skipped, instead of  being  inter-
       preted.   If the control escape encountered was `%?', then
       the condition associated with that control escape is eval-
       uated,  and  interpretation  proceeds  after  that test as

       described in  the  previous  paragraph.   If  the  control
       escape  encountered  was  `%|', then the format text up to
       the corresponding `%>' escape is interpreted normally.  As
       above,  the  `%>'  escape  is  not  interpreted and normal
       interpretation resumes after the `%>' escape.

       The `%?' control escape and its following format  text  is
       optional,  and  may  be  included zero or more times.  The
       `%|' control escape and its following format text is  also
       optional, and may be included zero or one times.

       Most functions expect an argument of a particular type:

       _A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t _D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n            _E_x_a_m_p_l_e _S_y_n_t_a_x
       literal  A literal number,      %(_f_u_n_c 1234)
                or string              %(_f_u_n_c text string)
       comp     Any header component   %(_f_u_n_c{_i_n_-_r_e_p_l_y_-_t_o})
       date     A date component       %(_f_u_n_c{_d_a_t_e})
       addr     An address component   %(_f_u_n_c{_f_r_o_m})
       expr     An optional component, %(_f_u_n_c(_f_u_n_c_2))
                function or control,   %(_f_u_n_c %<{_r_e_p_l_y_-_t_o}%|%{_f_r_o_m}%>)
                perhaps nested         %(_f_u_n_c(_f_u_n_c_2{_c_o_m_p}))

       The  types _d_a_t_e and _a_d_d_r have the same syntax as _c_o_m_p, but
       require that the header component be  a  date  string,  or
       address string, respectively.

       All arguments except those of type _e_x_p_r are required.  For
       the _e_x_p_r argument type, the leading `%'  must  be  omitted
       for  component  and function escape arguments, and must be
       present (with a leading space) for  control  escape  argu-
       ments.

       The  evaluation  of  format  strings  is based on a simple
       machine with an integer register _n_u_m, and  a  text  string
       register  _s_t_r.  When a function escape is processed, if it
       accepts an optional _e_x_p_r argument which is not present, it
       reads  the current value of either _n_u_m or _s_t_r as appropri-
       ate.


   RReettuurrnn vvaalluueess
       Component escapes write the value of their message  header
       in  _s_t_r.  Function escapes write their return value in _n_u_m
       for functions returning _i_n_t_e_g_e_r or _b_o_o_l_e_a_n values, and  in
       _s_t_r  for  functions returning string values.  (The _b_o_o_l_e_a_n
       type is a subset of integers with usual values 0=false and
       1=true.)   Control escapes return a _b_o_o_l_e_a_n value, and set
       _n_u_m.

       All component escapes, and those  function  escapes  which
       return an _i_n_t_e_g_e_r or _s_t_r_i_n_g value, pass this value back to
       their caller in addition to setting  _s_t_r  or  _n_u_m.   These
       escapes will print out this value unless called as part of
       an argument to another  escape  sequence.   Escapes  which
       return  a  _b_o_o_l_e_a_n  value do pass this value back to their
       caller in _n_u_m, but will never print out the value.

       writes  the  value of the header component "From:" to _s_t_r;
       then (_m_y_m_b_o_x) reads _s_t_r and writes its result to _n_u_m; then
       the control escape evaluates _n_u_m.  If _n_u_m is non-zero, the
       string "To: " is printed followed  by  the  value  of  the
       header component "To:".

       A  minor  explanation  of  (_m_y_m_b_o_x{_c_o_m_p}) is in order.  In
       general, it checks each of the  addresses  in  the  header
       component  "_c_o_m_p"  against the user's mailbox name and any
       _A_l_t_e_r_n_a_t_e_-_M_a_i_l_b_o_x_e_s.   It  returns  true  if  any  address
       matches,  however,  it  also  returns  true  if the "_c_o_m_p"
       header is not present in  the  message.   If  needed,  the
       (_n_u_l_l)  function  can  be used to explicitly test for this
       condition.

       When a function or component escape is interpreted and the
       result  will  be  immediately  printed,  an optional field
       width can be specified to print the  field  in  exactly  a
       given number of characters.  For example, a numeric escape
       like %4(_s_i_z_e) will print at most 4 digits of  the  message
       size;  overflow  will  be  indicated by a `?' in the first
       position (like `?234').  A string escape like %4(_m_e)  will
       print  the  first  4  characters  and truncate at the end.
       Short fields are padded at the right with the fill charac-
       ter  (normally,  a  blank).   If  the field width argument
       begins with a leading zero, then the fill character is set
       to a zero.

       As  above,  the  functions  (_p_u_t_n_u_m_f)  and (_p_u_t_s_t_r_f) print
       their result in exactly the number of characters specified
       by  their  leading  field  width  argument.   For example,
       %06(_p_u_t_n_u_m_f(_s_i_z_e)) will print the message size in a  field
       six   characters   wide   filled   with   leading   zeros;
       %14(_p_u_t_s_t_r_f{_f_r_o_m}) will print the "From:" header component
       in  fourteen  characters  with  trailing  spaces  added as
       needed.  For _p_u_t_s_t_r_f, using a negative value for the field
       width  causes right-justification of the string within the
       field, with padding on the left up  to  the  field  width.
       The  functions (_p_u_t_n_u_m) and (_p_u_t_s_t_r) print their result in
       the minimum number of characters required, and ignore  any
       leading field width argument.

       The  available  output width is kept in an internal regis-
       ter; any output past this width will be truncated.

       Comments may be inserted in most places where  a  function
       argument  is not expected.  A comment begins with `%;' and
       ends with a (non-escaped) newline.

MH-FORMAT(5)         BSD Programmer's Manual         MH-FORMAT(5)


       With all this in mind, here's the  default  format  string
       for _s_c_a_n.  It's been divided into several pieces for read-
       ability.  The first part is:

            %4(msg)%<(cur)+%| %>%<{replied}-%?{encrypted}E%| %>

       which says that the message number should  be  printed  in
       four  digits, if the message is the current message then a
       `+' else a space should be printed, and  if  a  "Replied:"
       field  is present then a `-' else if an "Encrypted:" field
       is present  then  an  `E'  otherwise  a  space  should  be
       printed.  Next:

            %02(mon{date})/%02(mday{date})

       the month and date are printed in two digits (zero filled)
       separated by a slash.  Next,

            %<{date} %|*>

       If a "Date:" field was present, then a space  is  printed,
       otherwise a `*'.  Next,

            %<(mymbox{from})%<{to}To:%14(friendly{to})%>%>

       if  the  message  is from me, and there is a "To:" header,
       print `To:' followed by a "user-friendly" rendering of the
       first address in the "To:" field.  Continuing,

            %<(zero)%17(friendly{from})%>

       if  either of the above two tests failed, then the "From:"
       address is  printed  in  a  "user-friendly"  format.   And
       finally,

            %{subject}%<{body}<<%{body}%>

       the subject and initial body (if any) are printed.

       For  a more complicated example, next consider the default
       _r_e_p_l_c_o_m_p_s format file.

            %(lit)%(formataddr %<{reply-to}

       This clears _s_t_r and formats the "Reply-To:" header if pre-
       sent.  If not present, the else-if clause is executed.

            %?{from}%?{sender}%?{return-path}%>)\

       This  formats  the  "From:",  "Sender:" and "Return-Path:"
       headers, stopping as soon  as  one  of  them  is  present.

MH-FORMAT(5)         BSD Programmer's Manual         MH-FORMAT(5)


       Next:

            %<(nonnull)%(void(width))%(putaddr To: )\n%>\

       If  the _f_o_r_m_a_t_a_d_d_r result is non-null, it is printed as an
       address (with line folding if needed)  in  a  field  _w_i_d_t_h
       wide with a leading label of "To: ".

            %(lit)%(formataddr{to})%(formataddr{cc})%(formataddr(me))\

       _s_t_r is cleared, and the "To:"  and  "Cc:"  headers,  along
       with  the  user's address (depending on what was specified
       with the "-cc" switch to _r_e_p_l) are formatted.

            %<(nonnull)%(void(width))%(putaddr cc: )\n%>\

       If the result is non-null, it is printed as above  with  a
       leading label of "cc: ".

            %<{fcc}Fcc: %{fcc}\n%>\

       If  a "-fcc folder" switch was given to _r_e_p_l (see _r_e_p_l (1)
       for more details about %{_f_c_c}), an "Fcc:" header  is  out-
       put.

            %<{subject}Subject: Re: %{subject}\n%>\

       If  a subject component was present, a suitable reply sub-
       ject is output.

            %<{date}In-reply-to: Your message of "\
            %<(nodate{date})%{date}%|%(pretty{date})%>."%<{message-id}
                         %{message-id}%>\n%>\
            --------

       If a date component was present, an "In-Reply-To:"  header
       is  output  with  the  preface "Your message of ".  If the
       date was parseable, it is output in a  user-friendly  for-
       mat,  otherwise  it  is  output  as-is.  The message-id is
       included if present.  As with all plain-text, the  row  of
       dashes are output as-is.

       This  last part is a good example for a little more elabo-
       ration.  Here's that part again in pseudo-code:

            if (comp_exists(date))  then
                 print ("In-reply-to: Your message of \"")
                 if (not_date_string(date.value) then
                      print (date.value)
                 else
                      print (pretty(date.value))

                 endif
                 print ("\"")
                 if (comp_exists(message-id)) then
                      print ("\n\t")
                      print (message-id.value)
                 endif
                 print ("\n")
            endif

       Although this seems complicated, in point  of  fact,  this
       method is flexible enough to extract individual fields and
       print them in any format the user desires.
