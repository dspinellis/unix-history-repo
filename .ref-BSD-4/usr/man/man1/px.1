.SH NAME
px \- Pascal interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B px
[ obj [ argument ... ] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Px
interprets the abstract machine code generated by
.I pi.
The first argument is the file to be interpreted, and defaults
to
.IR obj \|;
remaining arguments are available to the Pascal program using the
built-ins
.I argv
and
.I argc.
.I Px
is also invoked by
.I pix
when running `load and go'.
.PP
If the program terminates abnormally an error message and a 
control flow backtrace are printed.
The number of statements executed and total execution time
are printed after normal termination.
The
.B p
option of
.I pi
suppresses all of this except the message indicating the cause
of abnormal termination.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Most run-time error messages are self-explanatory.
Some of the more unusual ones are:
.HP 6
Reference to an inactive file
.br
A file other than
.I input
or
.I output
was used before a call to
.I reset
or
.I rewrite.
.HP 6
Statement count limit exceeded
.br
The limit of 500,000 executed statements
(which prevents excessive looping or recursion)
has been exceeded.
.HP 6
Bad data found on integer read
.br
.ns
.HP 6
Bad data found on real read
.br
Usually, non-numeric input was found for a number.
For reals, Pascal requires digits before and after the decimal
point so that numbers like `.1' or `21.' evoke the second diagnostic.
.HP 6
panic:
.I  "Some message"
.br
Indicates a internal inconsistency detected in
.I px
probably due to a Pascal system bug.

.SH BUGS
Post-mortem traceback is not limited;
infinite recursion leads to almost infinite traceback.
