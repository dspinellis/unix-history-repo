.SH NAME
tput \- terminal capability interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.ft B
tput [ -T term ] attribute
.ft R
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Tput
makes terminal-dependent information available to users or shell
applications.
The options are as follows:
.TP
\-T
The terminal name as specified in the
.I termcap
database, for example, ``vt100'' or ``xterm''.
If not specified,
.I tput
retrieves the ``TERM'' variable from the environment.
.PP
.I Tput
outputs a string if the
.I attribute
is of type string; a number if it is of type integer.
Otherwise,
.I tput
exits 0 if the terminal has the capability and 1 if it does not,
without further action.
.PP
The following special attributes are available:
.TP
clear
.br
Clear the screen (the
.I termcap
``cl'' sequence).
.TP
init
.br
Initialize the terminal (the
.I termcap
``is'' sequence).
.TP
longname
Print the descriptive name of the user's terminal type.
.TP
reset
.br
Reset the terminal (the
.I termcap
``rs'' sequence).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The exit value of
.I tput
is based on the last attribute specified.
If the attribute is of type string or of type integer,
.I tput
exits 0 if the attribute is defined for this terminal type and 1
if it is not.
If the attribute is of type boolean,
.I tput
exits 0 if the terminal has this attribute, and 1 if it does not.
.I Tput
exits 2 if any error occurred.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
termcap(3), termcap(5)
.SH BUGS
.I Tput
can't really distinguish between different types of attributes.
This is due to the limited interface in the current version of
.IR termcap (3),
and will be fixed in the near future.
