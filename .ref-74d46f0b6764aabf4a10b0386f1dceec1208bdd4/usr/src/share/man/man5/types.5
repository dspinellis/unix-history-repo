are used in UNIX system code;
some data of these types are accessible to user code:

.so /usr/include/sys/types.h

The form
.I daddr_t
is used for disk addresses except in an
i-node on disk, see
.IR fs (5).
Times are encoded in seconds since 00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970.
The major and minor parts of a device code
specify kind and unit number of a device
and are installation-dependent.
Offsets are measured in bytes from the beginning of a file.
The
.I label_t
variables are used to save the processor state
while another process is running.
