Updating Publication Lists
.AU
M. E. Lesk

Introduction.
.PP
.\".if \nP>0 .pn 14
This note describes several commands to update the
publication lists.
The data base consisting of these lists is kept in
a set of files in
the directory
.I /usr/dict/papers
on the Version 7
.UX
system.
The reason for having special commands to update these files is
that they are indexed, and the only reasonable way to find the
items to be updated is to use the index.
However, altering the files
destroys the usefulness of the index,
and makes further editing difficult.
So the recommended procedure is to
.IP (1)
Prepare additions, deletions, and changes in separate files.
.IP (2)
Update the data base and reindex.
.LP
Whenever you make changes, etc. it is necessary to run
the ``add & index'' step before logging off; otherwise the
changes do not take effect.
The next section shows the format of the files
in the data base.
After that, the procedures for
preparing additions, preparing changes, preparing deletions,
and updating the public data base are given.
.NH
Publication Format.
.PP
The format of a data base entry is given completely in ``Some Applications
of Inverted Indexes on UNIX'' by M. E. Lesk,
the first part of this report,
.if \nP=0 (also TM 77-1274-17)
and is summarized here via a few examples.
In each example, first the output format for an item is shown,
and then the corresponding data base entry.

Other forms of publication can be entered similarly.
Note that conference
proceedings are entered as if journals,
with the conference name on a
.I %J
line.
This is also sometimes appropriate for obscure publications
such as series of lecture notes.
When something is both a report and an article, or
both a memorandum and an article, enter all necessary information
for both; see the first article above, for example.
Extra information (such as ``In preparation'' or ``Japanese translation'')
should be placed on a line beginning
.I %O .
The most common use of %O lines now is for ``Also in ...'' to give
an additional reference to a secondary appearance of the same paper.
.PP
Some of the possible fields of a citation are:
.TS
c c 5 c c
a l   a l .
Letter	Meaning	Letter	Meaning
A	Author	K	Extra keys
B	Book including item	N	Issue number
C	City of publication	O	Other
D	Date	P	Page numbers
E	Editor of book	R	Report number
I	Publisher (issuer)	T	Title of item
J	Journal name	V	Volume number
.TE
Note that
.I %B
is used to indicate the title
of a book containing the article being entered;
when an item is an entire book, the title should
be entered with a
.I %T
as usual.
.PP
Normally, the order of items does not matter.  The only exception is
that if there are multiple authors (%A lines) the order of authors
should be that on the paper.
If a line is too long, it may be continued on to the next line;
any line not beginning with % or . (dot) is assumed to be
a continuation of the previous line.
Again, see the first article above for an example of a long title.
Except for authors, do not repeat any items; if two %J lines are
given, for example, the first is ignored.
Multiple items on the same file should be separated by blank lines.
.PP
Note that in formatted printouts of the file, the
exact appearance of the items is determined by
a set of macros and the formatting programs.
Do not try to adjust fonts, punctuation, etc. by editing
the data base; it is wasted effort.  In case someone has
a real need for a differently-formatted output, a new set
of macros can easily be generated to provide alternative
appearances of the citations.
.NH
Updating and Re-indexing.
.PP
This section describes the commands that are used to manipulate
and change the data base.
It explains the procedures for (a) finding references in the data base,
(b) adding new references, (c) changing existing references, and (d)
deleting references.
Remember that all changes, additions, and deletions are done by preparing
separate files and then running an `update and reindex' step.
.PP
.I
Checking what's there now.
.R
Often you will want to know what is currently in the data base.
There is a special command
.I lookbib
to look for things and print them
out.
It searches for articles based on words in the title, or the author's name,
or the date.
For example, you could find the first paper above with
.DS
lookbib aho ullman maximal subsequence 1976
.DE
or
.DS
lookbib aho ullman hirschberg
.DE
.LP
If you don't give enough words, several items will be found;
if you spell some wrong, nothing will be found.
There are around 4300 papers in the public file; you should
always use this command to check when you are not sure
whether a certain paper is there or not.
.PP
.I
Additions.
.R
To add new papers, just type in, on one or more files, the citations
for the new papers.
Remember to check first if the papers are already in the data base.
For example, if a paper has a previous memo version, this should
be treated as a change to an existing entry, rather than
a new entry.
If several new papers are being typed on the same file, be
sure that there is a blank line between each two papers.
.PP
.I
Changes.
.R
To change an item, it should be extracted onto a file.
This is done with the command
.DS
pub.chg key1 key2 key3 ...
.DE
where the items key1, key2, key3, etc. are
a set of keys that will find the paper,
as in the
.I lookbib
command.
That is, if
.DS
lookbib johnson yacc cstr
.DE
will find a item (to, in this case, Computing Science Technical Report
No. 32, ``YACC: Yet Another Compiler-Compiler,''
by S. C. Johnson)
then
.DS
pub.chg johnson yacc cstr
.DE
will permit you to edit the item.
The
.I pub.chg
command
extracts the item onto a file named ``bibxxx'' where ``xxx''
is a 3-digit number, e.g. ``bib234''.
The command will print the file name it has chosen.
If the set of keys finds more than one paper (or no papers) an
error message is printed and no file is written.
Each reference to be changed must be extracted with a separate
.I pub.chg
command, and each will be placed on a separate file.
You should then edit the ``bibxxx'' file as desired to change the item,
using the UNIX editor.
Do not delete or change the first line of the file, however, which begins
.I %#
and is a special code line to tell the update program
which item is being altered.
You may delete or change other lines, or add lines, as you wish.
The changes are not actually made in the public data
base until you run the update command
.I pub.run
(see below).
Thus, if after extracting an item and modifying it, you decide
that you'd rather leave things as they were, delete the
``bibxxx'' file, and your change request will disappear.
.PP
.I
Deletions.
.R
To delete an entry from the data base,
type the command
.DS
pub.del key1 key2 key3 ...
.DE
where the items key1, key2, etc. are a set
of keys that will find the paper, as with the
.I lookbib
command.
That is, if
.DS
lookbib Aho hirschberg ullman
.DE
will find a paper,
.DS
pub.del aho hirschberg ullman
.DE
deletes it.
Note that upper and lower case are equivalent in keys.
The
.I pub.del
command will print the entry being deleted.
It also gives the name of a ``bibxxx'' file on which the deletion
command is stored.
The actual deletion is not done until the changes, additions, etc.
are processed, as with the
.I pub.chg
command.
If, after seeing the item to be deleted, you change your
mind about throwing it away, delete the ``bibxxx'' file
and the delete request disappears.
Again, if the list of keys does not uniquely identify one paper,
an error message is given.
.PP
Remember that the default versions of the commands described here
edit a public data base.
Do not delete
items unless you are sure deletion is proper; usually this
means that there are duplicate entries for the same paper.
Otherwise, view requests for deletion with skepticism; even
if one person has no need for a particular item in the data base,
someone else may want it there.
.PP
If an item is correct, but should not appear in the ``List of Publications''
as normally produced, add the line
.DS
%K DNL
.DE
to the item.
This preserves the item intact, but implies ``Do Not List'' to the
to the commands that print publication lists.
The DNL line is normally used for some technical reports,
minor memoranda, or other
low-grade publications.
.PP
.I
Update and reindex.
.R
When you have completed a session of changes, you should
type the command
.DS
pub.run file1 file2 ...
.DE
where the names ``file1'', ... are the new files of additions you
have prepared.
You need not list the ``bibxxx'' files representing changes and
deletions; they are processed automatically.
All of the new items are edited into the standard
public data base, and then a new index is made.  This process
takes about 15 minutes; during this time,
searches of the data base will be slower.
.PP
Normally, you should execute
.I pub.run
just before you logoff after performing
some edit requests.
However, if you don't, the various change request files remain
in your directory
until you finally do execute
.I pub.run.
When the changes are processed, the ``bibxxx'' files are deleted.
It is not desirable to wait too long before processing changes,
however, to avoid conflicts with someone else who wishes to change
the same file.
If executing
.I pub.run
produces the message ``File bibxxx too old''
it means that someone else has been editing the same file
between the time you prepared your changes, and the time you typed
.I pub.run.
You must delete such old change files and
re-enter them.
.PP
Note that although
.I pub.run
discards the ``bibxxx'' files after
processing them, your files of additions are left around
even after
.I pub.run
is finished.
If they were typed in only for purposes of
updating the data base, you may delete them
after they have been processed by
.I pub.run.
.PP
.I
Example.
.R
Suppose, for example, that you wish to
.IP (1)
Add to the data base the memos ``The Dilogarithm Function of a Real Argument''
by R. Morris, and
``UNIX Software Distribution by Communication Link,''
by M. E. Lesk and A. S. Cohen;
.IP (2)
Delete from the data base the item
``Cheap Typesetters'', by M. E. Lesk,
SIGLASH Newsletter, 1973;
and
.IP (3)
Change ``J. Assoc. Comp. Mach.'' to ``Jour. ACM'' in the citation
for Aho, Hirschberg, and Ullman shown above.
.LP
The procedure would be as follows.
First, you would make a file
containing the additions,
here called ``new.1'', in the normal way using the UNIX editor.
In the script shown below, the computer prompts are
.if n underlined.
.if t in italics.

Next you would specify the deletion, which would be done with the

.if n _$ pub.del lesk cheap typesetters siglash
.if t \f2$\f1 pub.del lesk cheap typesetters siglash

to which the computer responds:

And then you would extract the Aho, Hirschberg and Ullman paper.
The dialogue involved is shown below.
First run
.I pub.chg
to extract the paper; it responds by printing
the citation and informing you that it was placed on file \f2bib123\f1.
That file is then edited.

Finally, execute
.I pub.run ,
making sure to remember that you
have prepared a new file ``new.1'':
.DS
\f2$\f1 pub.run new.1
.DE
and about fifteen minutes later the new index would be complete
and all the changes would be included.
.NH
Printing a Publication List
.PP
There are two commands for printing a publication list,
depending on whether you want to print one person's list,
or the list of many people.
To print a list for one person, use the
.I pub.indiv
command:
.DS
pub.indiv M Lesk
.DE
This runs off the list for M. Lesk and puts it in file ``output''.
Note that no `.' is given after the initial.
In case of ambiguity two initials can be used.
Similarly, to get the list for group of people, say
.DS
pub.org xxx
.DE
which prints all the publications of the members of organization
.I xxx ,
taking the names for the list in the file
.I /usr/dict/papers/centlist/xxx .
This command should normally be run in the background; it takes
perhaps 15 minutes.
Two options are available with these commands:
.DS
pub.indiv \-p M Lesk
.DE
prints only the papers, leaving out unpublished notes, patents, etc.
Also
.DS
pub.indiv \-t M Lesk | gcat
.DE
prints a typeset copy, instead of a computer printer copy.
In this case it has been directed to an alternate typesetter with the
`gcat' command.
These options may be used together, and may be used with the
.I pub.org
command as well.
For example, to print
only the papers for all of organization zzz and typeset them,
you could type
.DS
pub.center \-t \-p zzz | gcat &
.DE
These publication lists are printed double column with a citation style
taken from a set of publication list macros; the macros, of course, can be
changed easily to adjust the format of the lists.
