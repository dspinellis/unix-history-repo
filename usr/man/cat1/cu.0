     _T_i_p and _c_u establish a full-duplex connection to another
     machine, giving the appearance of being logged in directly
     on the remote cpu.  It goes without saying that you must
     have a login on the machine (or equivalent) to which you
     wish to connect.  The preferred interface is _t_i_p.	The _c_u
     interface is included for those people attached to the
     ``call UNIX'' command of version 7.  This manual page
     describes only _t_i_p.

     Typed characters are normally transmitted directly to the
     remote machine (which does the echoing as well).  A tilde
     (`~') appearing as the first character of a line is an
     escape signal; the following are recognized:

     ~~^^DD ~~..    Drop the connection and exit (you may still be
	       logged in on the remote machine).

     ~~cc  [_n_a_m_e]
	       Change directory to name (no argument implies
	       change to your home directory).

     ~~!!        Escape to a shell (exiting the shell will return
	       you to tip).

     ~~>>        Copy file from local to remote.	_T_i_p prompts for
	       the name of a local file to transmit.

     ~~<<        Copy file from remote to local.	_T_i_p prompts first
	       for the name of the file to be sent, then for a
	       command to be executed on the remote machine.

     ~~pp _f_r_o_m [ _t_o ]
	       Send a file to a remote UNIX host.  The put com-
	       mand causes the remote UNIX system to run the com-
	       mand string ``cat > 'to''', while _t_i_p sends it the
	       ``from'' file.  If the ``to'' file isn't specified
	       the ``from'' file name is used.	This command is
	       actually a UNIX specific version of the ``~>''
	       command.

	       command the ``to'' file defaults to the ``from''
	       file name if it isn't specified. The remote host
	       executes the command string ``cat 'from';echo ^A''
	       to send the file to _t_i_p.

     ~~||        Pipe the output from a remote command to a local
	       UNIX process.  The command string sent to the
	       local UNIX system is processed by the shell.

     ~~$$        Pipe the output from a local UNIX process to the
	       remote host.  The command string sent to the local
	       UNIX system is processed by the shell.

     ~~##        Send a BREAK to the remote system. For systems
	       which don't support the necessary _i_o_c_t_l call the
	       break is simulated by a sequence of line speed
	       changes and DEL characters.

     ~~ss        Set a variable (see the discussion below).

     ~~^^ZZ       Stop _t_i_p (only available with job control).

     ~~^^YY       Stop only the ``local side'' of _t_i_p (only avail-
	       able with job control); the ``remote side'' of
	       _t_i_p, the side that displays output from the remote
	       host, is left running.

     _T_i_p uses the file /etc/remote to find how to reach a partic-
     ular system and to find out how it should operate while
     talking to the system; refer to _r_e_m_o_t_e(5) for a full
     description.  Each system has a default baud rate with which
     to establish a connection.  If this value is not suitable,
     the baud rate to be used may be specified on the command
     line, e.g. ``tip -300 mds''.

     When _t_i_p establishes a connection it sends out a connection
     message to the remote system; the default value, if any, is
     defined in /etc/remote.

     When _t_i_p prompts for an argument (e.g. during setup of a
     file transfer) the line typed may be edited with the stan-
     dard erase and kill characters.  A null line in response to
     a prompt, or an interrupt, will abort the dialogue and
     return you to the remote machine.

     _T_i_p guards against multiple users connecting to a remote
     system by opening modems and terminal lines with exclusive
     access, and by honoring the locking protocol used by
     _u_u_c_p(1C).

TIP(1C)             UNIX Programmer's Manual		  TIP(1C)



     During file transfers _t_i_p provides a running count of the
     number of lines transferred.  When using the ~> and ~< com-
     mands, the ``eofread'' and ``eofwrite'' variables are used
     to recognize end-of-file when reading, and specify end-of-
     file when writing (see below).  File transfers normally
     depend on tandem mode for flow control.  If the remote sys-
     tem does not support tandem mode, ``echocheck'' may be set
     to indicate _t_i_p should synchronize with the remote system on
     the echo of each transmitted character.

     When _t_i_p must dial a phone number to connect to a system it
     will print various messages indicating its actions.  _T_i_p
     supports the DEC DN-11 and Racal-Vadic 831 auto-call-units;
     the DEC DF02 and DF03, Ventel 212+, Racal-Vadic 3451, and
     Bizcomp 1031 and 1032 integral call unit/modems.

     VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS

     _T_i_p maintains a set of _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e_s which control its opera-
     tion.  Some of these variable are read-only to normal users
     (root is allowed to change anything of interest).	Variables
     may be displayed and set through the ``s'' escape.  The syn-
     tax for variables is patterned after _v_i(1) and _M_a_i_l(1).
     Supplying ``all'' as an argument to the set command displays
     all variables readable by the user.  Alternatively, the user
     may request display of a particular variable by attaching a
     `?' to the end.  For example ``escape?'' displays the
     current escape character.

     Variables are numeric, string, character, or boolean values.
     Boolean variables are set merely by specifying their name;
     they may be reset by prepending a `!' to the name.  Other
     variable types are set by concatenating an `=' and the
     value.  The entire assignment must not have any blanks in
     it.  A single set command may be used to interrogate as well
     as set a number of variables.  Variables may be initialized
     at run time by placing set commands (without the ``~s'' pre-
     fix in a file ._t_i_p_r_c in one's home directory).  The --vv
     option causes _t_i_p to display the sets as they are made.
     Certain common variables have abbreviations. The following
     is a list of common variables, their abbreviations, and
     their default values.

     bbeeaauuttiiffyy
	  (bool) Discard unprintable characters when a session is
	  being scripted; abbreviated _b_e.

	  blished; abbreviated _b_a.

	  file transfer command is based on recipt of this char-
	  acter.

     rraaiissee
	  (bool) Upper case mapping mode; abbreviated _r_a; default
	  value is _o_f_f.  When this mode is enabled, all lower
	  case letters will be mapped to upper case by _t_i_p for
	  transmission to the remote machine.

	  is _o_f_f.  When _s_c_r_i_p_t is _t_r_u_e, _t_i_p will record every-
	  thing transmitted by the remote machine in the script
	  record file specified in _r_e_c_o_r_d.  If the _b_e_a_u_t_i_f_y
	  switch is on, only printable ASCII characters will be
	  included in the script file (those characters betwee
	  040 and 0177).  The variable _e_x_c_e_p_t_i_o_n_s is used to
	  indicate characters which are an exception to the nor-
	  mal beautification rules.
