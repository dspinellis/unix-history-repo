     _C_o_l_c_r_t provides virtual half-line and reverse line feed
     sequences for terminals without such capability, and on
     which overstriking is destructive.  Half-line characters and
     underlining (changed to dashing `-') are placed on new lines
     in between the normal output lines.

     The optional -- suppresses all underlining.  It is especially
     useful for previewing _a_l_l_b_o_x_e_d tables from _t_b_l(1).

     The option --22 causes all half-lines to be printed, effec-
     tively double spacing the output.	Normally, a minimal space
     output format is used which will suppress empty lines.  The
     program never suppresses two consecutive empty lines, how-
     ever.  The --22 option is useful for sending output to the
     line printer when the output contains superscripts and sub-
     scripts which would otherwise be invisible.

     A typical use of _c_o_l_c_r_t would be

     Should fold underlines onto blanks even with the `--' option
     so that a true underline character would show; if we did
     this, however, _c_o_l_c_r_t wouldn't get rid of _c_u'_d underlining
     completely.

     Can't back up more than 102 lines.

     General overstriking is lost; as a special case `|' over-
     struck with `-' or underline becomes `+'.

     Lines are trimmed to 132 characters.

     Some provision should be made for processing superscripts
     and subscripts in documents which are already double-spaced.
