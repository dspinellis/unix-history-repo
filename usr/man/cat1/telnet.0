     telnet [ host [ port ] ]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     _T_e_l_n_e_t is used to communicate with another host using the
     TTEELLNNEETT protocol.  If _t_e_l_n_e_t is invoked without arguments, it
     enters command mode, indicated by its prompt ("telnet>").
     In this mode, it accepts and executes the commands listed
     below.  If it is invoked with arguments, it performs an ooppeenn
     command (see below) with those arguments.

     Once a connection has been opened, _t_e_l_n_e_t enters an input
     mode.  The input mode entered will be either "character at a
     time" or "line by line" depending on what the remote system
     supports.

     In "character at a time" mode, most text typed is immedi-
     ately sent to the remote host for processing.

     In "line by line" mode, all text is echoed locally, and
     (normally) only completed lines are sent to the remote host.
     The "local echo character" (initially "^E") may be used to
     turn off and on the local echo (this would mostly be used to
     enter passwords without the password being echoed).

     In either mode, if the _l_o_c_a_l_c_h_a_r_s toggle is TRUE (the
     default in line mode; see below), the user's _q_u_i_t, _i_n_t_r, and
     _f_l_u_s_h characters are trapped locally, and sent as TTEELLNNEETT
     protocol sequences to the remote side.  There are options
     (see ttooggggllee _a_u_t_o_f_l_u_s_h and ttooggggllee _a_u_t_o_s_y_n_c_h below) which
     cause this action to flush subsequent output to the terminal
     (until the remote host acknowledges the TTEELLNNEETT sequence) and
     flush previous terminal input (in the case of _q_u_i_t and
     _i_n_t_r).

     While connected to a remote host, _t_e_l_n_e_t command mode may be
     entered by typing the _t_e_l_n_e_t "escape character" (initially
     "^]").  When in command mode, the normal terminal editing
     conventions are available.

     CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS

     The following commands are available.  Only enough of each
     command to uniquely identify it need be typed (this is also
     true for arguments to the mmooddee, sseett, ttooggggllee, and ddiissppllaayy
     commands).

	  is specified, _t_e_l_n_e_t will attempt to contact a TTEELLNNEETT
	  server at the default port.  The host specification may
	  be either a host name (see _h_o_s_t_s(5)) or an Internet
	  address specified in the "dot notation" (see _i_n_e_t(3N)).

     cclloossee
	  Close a TTEELLNNEETT session and return to command mode.

     qquuiitt
	  Close any open TTEELLNNEETT session and exit _t_e_l_n_e_t.  An end
	  of file (in command mode) will also close a session and
	  exit.

     zz
	  Suspend _t_e_l_n_e_t.  This command only works when the user
	  is using the _c_s_h(1).

     mmooddee _t_y_p_e
	  _T_y_p_e is either _l_i_n_e (for "line by line" mode) or _c_h_a_r_-
	  _a_c_t_e_r (for "character at a time" mode).  The remote
	  host is asked for permission to go into the requested
	  mode.  If the remote host is capable of entering that
	  mode, the requested mode will be entered.

     ssttaattuuss
	  Show the current status of _t_e_l_n_e_t.  This includes the
	  peer one is connected to, as well as the current mode.

     ddiissppllaayy [ _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t... ]
	  Displays all, or some, of the sseett and ttooggggllee values
	  (see below).

     ?? [ _c_o_m_m_a_n_d ]
	  Get help.  With no arguments, _t_e_l_n_e_t prints a help sum-
	  mary.  If a command is specified, _t_e_l_n_e_t will print the
	  help information for just that command.

     sseenndd _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s
	  Sends one or more special character sequences to the
	  remote host.	The following are the arguments which may
	  be specified (more than one argument may be specified
	  at a time):

	  _e_s_c_a_p_e
	       Sends the current _t_e_l_n_e_t escape character (ini-
	       tially "^]").

	  _s_y_n_c_h
	       Sends the TTEELLNNEETT SSYYNNCCHH sequence.  This sequence
	       causes the remote system to discard all previously
	       typed (but not yet read) input.	This sequence is
	       sent as TCP urgent data (and may not work if the

	       remote system is a 4.2 BSD system -- if it doesn't
	       work, a lower case "r" may be echoed on the termi-
	       nal).

	  _b_r_k
	       Sends the TTEELLNNEETT BBRRKK (Break) sequence, which may
	       have significance to the remote system.

	  _i_p
	       Sends the TTEELLNNEETT IIPP (Interrupt Process) sequence,
	       which should cause the remote system to abort the
	       currently running process.

	  _a_o
	       Sends the TTEELLNNEETT AAOO (Abort Output) sequence, which
	       should cause the remote system to flush all output
	       ffrroomm the remote system ttoo the user's terminal.

	  _a_y_t
	       Sends the TTEELLNNEETT AAYYTT (Are You There) sequence, to
	       which the remote system may or may not choose to
	       respond.

	  _e_c
	       Sends the TTEELLNNEETT EECC (Erase Character) sequence,
	       which should cause the remote system to erase the
	       last character entered.

	  _e_l
	       Sends the TTEELLNNEETT EELL (Erase Line) sequence, which
	       should cause the remote system to erase the line
	       currently being entered.

	  _g_a
	       Sends the TTEELLNNEETT GGAA (Go Ahead) sequence, which
	       likely has no significance to the remote system.

	  _n_o_p
	       Sends the TTEELLNNEETT NNOOPP (No OPeration) sequence.

	  ?
	       Prints out help information for the sseenndd command.

     sseett _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t _v_a_l_u_e
	  Set any one of a number of _t_e_l_n_e_t variables to a
	  specific value.  The special value "off" turns off the
	  function associated with the variable.  The values of
	  variables may be interrogated with the ddiissppllaayy command.
	  The variables which may be specified are:

	       echoing of entered characters (for normal process-
	       ing), and suppressing echoing of entered charac-
	       ters (for entering, say, a password).

	  _e_s_c_a_p_e
	       This is the _t_e_l_n_e_t escape character (initially
	       "^[") which causes entry into _t_e_l_n_e_t command mode
	       (when connected to a remote system).

	  _i_n_t_e_r_r_u_p_t
	       If _t_e_l_n_e_t is in _l_o_c_a_l_c_h_a_r_s mode (see ttooggggllee _l_o_c_a_l_-

	       a TTEELLNNEETT IIPP sequence (see sseenndd _i_p above) is sent
	       to the remote host.  The initial value for the

	       TTEELLNNEETT BBRRKK sequence (see sseenndd _b_r_k above) is sent
	       to the remote host.  The initial value for the
	       quit character is taken to be the terminal's qquuiitt
	       character.

	  _f_l_u_s_h_o_u_t_p_u_t
	       If _t_e_l_n_e_t is in _l_o_c_a_l_c_h_a_r_s mode (see ttooggggllee _l_o_c_a_l_-

	       If _t_e_l_n_e_t is operating in "line by line" mode,
	       entering this character as the first character on
	       a line will cause this character to be sent to the

     ttooggggllee _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s...
	  Toggle (between TRUE and FALSE) various flags that con-
	  trol how _t_e_l_n_e_t responds to events.  More than one
	  argument may be specified.  The state of these flags
	  may be interrogated with the ddiissppllaayy command.  Valid
	  arguments are:

	  _l_o_c_a_l_c_h_a_r_s
	       If this is TRUE, then the _f_l_u_s_h, _i_n_t_e_r_r_u_p_t, _q_u_i_t,
	       _e_r_a_s_e, and _k_i_l_l characters (see sseett above) are
	       recognized locally, and transformed into (hope-
	       fully) appropriate TTEELLNNEETT control sequences
	       (respectively _a_o, _i_p, _b_r_k, _e_c, and _e_l; see sseenndd
	       above).	The initial value for this toggle is TRUE
	       in "line by line" mode, and FALSE in "character at
	       a time" mode.

	  _a_u_t_o_f_l_u_s_h
	       If _a_u_t_o_f_l_u_s_h and _l_o_c_a_l_c_h_a_r_s are both TRUE, then
	       when the _a_o, _i_n_t_r, or _q_u_i_t characters are recog-
	       nized (and transformed into TTEELLNNEETT sequences; see
	       sseett above for details), _t_e_l_n_e_t refuses to display
	       any data on the user's terminal until the remote
	       system acknowledges (via a TTEELLNNEETT _T_i_m_i_n_g _M_a_r_k
	       option) that it has processed those TTEELLNNEETT
	       sequences.  The initial value for this toggle is
	       TRUE if the terminal user had not done an "stty
	       noflsh", otherwise FALSE (see _s_t_t_y(_1)).

	  _a_u_t_o_s_y_n_c_h
	       If _a_u_t_o_s_y_n_c_h and _l_o_c_a_l_c_h_a_r_s are both TRUE, then
	       when either the _i_n_t_r or _q_u_i_t characters is typed
	       (see sseett above for descriptions of the _i_n_t_r and
	       _q_u_i_t characters), the resulting TTEELLNNEETT sequence
	       sent is followed by the TTEELLNNEETT SSYYNNCCHH sequence.
	       This procedure sshhoouulldd cause the remote system to
	       begin throwing away all previously typed input
	       until both of the TTEELLNNEETT sequences have been read
	       and acted upon.	The initial value of this toggle
	       is FALSE.

	  _c_r_m_o_d
	       Toggle carriage return mode.  When this mode is
	       enabled, most carriage return characters received
	       from the remote host will be mapped into a

	       carriage return followed by a line feed.  This
	       mode does not affect those characters typed by the
	       user, only those received from the remote host.
	       This mode is not very useful unless the remote
	       host only sends carriage return, but never line
	       feed.  The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.

	  _d_e_b_u_g
	       Toggles socket level debugging (useful only to the
	       _s_u_p_e_ruser).  The initial value for this toggle is
	       FALSE.

	  _o_p_t_i_o_n_s
	       Toggles the display of some internal _t_e_l_n_e_t proto-
	       col processing (having to do with TTEELLNNEETT options).
	       The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.

	  _n_e_t_d_a_t_a
	       Toggles the display of all network data (in hexa-
	       decimal format).  The initial value for this tog-
	       gle is FALSE.

	  ?
	       Displays the legal ttooggggllee commands.

BBUUGGSS
     There is no adequate way for dealing with flow control.

     On some remote systems, echo has to be turned off manually
     when in "line by line" mode.

     There is enough settable state to justify a ._t_e_l_n_e_t_r_c file.

     No capability for a ._t_e_l_n_e_t_r_c file is provided.

     In "line by line" mode, the terminal's _e_o_f character is only
     recognized (and sent to the remote system) when it is the
     first character on a line.
