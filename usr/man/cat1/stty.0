     _S_t_t_y sets certain I/O options on the current output termi-
     nal, placing its output on the diagnostic output.	With no
     argument, it reports the speed of the terminal and the set-
     tings of the options which are different from their
     defaults.	Use of one of the following options modifies the
     output as described:

     aallll       All normally used option settings are reported.

     eevveerryytthhiinngg
	       Everything _s_t_t_y knows about is printed.

     ssppeeeedd     The terminal speed alone is printed on the stan-
	       dard output.

     ssiizzee      The terminal (window) sizes are printed on the
	       standard output, first rows and then columns.

	       The option strings are selected from the following
	       set:

     eevveenn      allow even parity input
     --eevveenn     disallow even parity input
     oodddd       allow odd parity input

	       other processing (interrupt, suspend, ...) is per-
	       formed
     --ccbbrreeaakk   make characters available to _r_e_a_d only when new-
	       line is received
     --nnll       allow carriage return for new-line, and output
	       CR-LF for carriage return or new-line
     nnll        accept only new-line to end lines

     ttaabbss      preserve tabs
     eekk        set erase and kill characters to # and @
     For the following commands which take a character argument
     _c, you may also specify _c as the ``u'' or ``undef'', to set
     the value to be undefined.  A value of ``^x'', a 2 character
     sequence, is also interpreted as a control character, with
     ``^?'' representing delete.

     eerraassee _c   set erase character to _c (default `#', but often
	       reset to ^H.)
     kkiillll _c    set kill character to _c (default `@', but often
	       reset to ^U.)
     iinnttrr _c    set interrupt character to _c (default DEL or ^?
	       (delete), but often reset to ^C.)
     qquuiitt _c    set quit character to _c (default control \.)
     ssttaarrtt _c   set start character to _c (default control Q.)
     ssttoopp _c    set stop character to _c (default control S.)
     eeooff _c     set end of file character to _c (default control
	       D.)
     bbrrkk _c     set break character to _c (default undefined.) This
	       character is an additional character causing
	       wakeup.

	       Set terminal baud rate to the number given, if
	       possible.  (These are the speeds supported by the
	       DH-11 interface).

     rroowwss _n    The terminal size is recorded as having _n rows.

     ccoolluummnnss _n The terminal size is recorded as having _n columns.

     ccoollss _n    is an alias for _c_o_l_u_m_n_s.

     A teletype driver which supports the job control processing
     of _c_s_h(1) and more functionality than the basic driver is
     fully described in _t_t_y(4).  The following options apply only
     to it.

     nneeww       Use new driver (switching flushes typeahead).
     ccrrtt       Set options for a CRT (crtbs, ctlecho and, if >=
	       1200 baud, crterase and crtkill.)
     ccrrttbbss     Echo backspaces on erase characters.
     pprrtteerraassee  For printing terminal echo erased characters back-
	       wards within ``\'' and ``/''.
     ccrrtteerraassee  Wipe out erased characters with ``backspace-
	       space-backspace.''
     --ccrrtteerraassee Leave erased characters visible; just backspace.
     ccrrttkkiillll   Wipe out input on like kill ala ccrrtteerraassee..
     --ccrrttkkiillll  Just echo line kill character and a newline on
	       line kill.
     ccttlleecchhoo   Echo control characters as ``^_x'' (and delete as
	       ``^?''.) Print two backspaces following the EOT
	       character (control D).
     --ccttlleecchhoo  Control characters echo as themselves; in cooked
	       mode EOT (control-D) is not echoed.

     ddeeccccttllqq   After output is suspended (normally by ^S), only a
	       start character (normally ^Q) will restart it.
	       This is compatible with DEC's vendor supplied sys-
	       tems.

     --ddeeccccttllqq  After output is suspended, any character typed
	       will restart it; the start character will restart
	       output without providing any input.  (This is the
	       default.)
     ttoossttoopp    Background jobs stop if they attempt terminal out-
	       put.
     --ttoossttoopp   Output from background jobs to the terminal is
	       allowed.

	       terminals).
     --ttiillddee    Leave poor ``~'' alone.

     ppeennddiinn    Input is pending after a switch from cbreak to
	       cooked and will be re-input when a read becomes
	       pending or more input arrives (internal state
	       bit).
     --ppeennddiinn   Input is not pending.
     ppaassss88     Passes all 8 bits through on input, in any mode.
     --ppaassss88    Strips the 0200 bit on input except in raw mode.
     mmddmmbbuuff    Start/stop output on carrier transitions (not
	       implemented).
     --mmddmmbbuuff   Return error if write attempted after carrier
	       drops.
     lliittoouutt    Send output characters without any processing.
     --lliittoouutt   Do normal output processing, inserting delays,
	       etc.
     nnoohhaanngg    Don't send hangup signal if carrier drops.
     --nnoohhaanngg   Send hangup signal to control process group when
	       carrier drops.
     eettxxaacckk    Diablo style etx/ack handshaking (not imple-
	       mented).

     The following special characters are applicable only to the
     new teletype driver and are not normally changed.

     ssuusspp _c    set suspend process character to _c (default con-
	       trol Z).
     ddssuusspp _c   set delayed suspend process character to _c
	       (default control Y).
     rrpprrnntt _c   set reprint line character to _c (default control
	       R).
     fflluusshh _c   set flush output character to _c (default control
	       O).
     wweerraassee _c  set word erase character to _c (default control W).
     llnneexxtt _c   set literal next character to _c (default control
	       V).
