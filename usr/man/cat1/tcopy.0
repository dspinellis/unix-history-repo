     _T_c_o_p_y is designed to copy magnetic tapes.	The only assump-
     tion made about the tape is that there are two tape marks at
     the end.  _T_c_o_p_y with only a source tape (rrmmtt00 by default)
     specified will print information about the sizes of records
     and tape files.  If a destination is specified a copy will
     be made of the source tape.  The blocking on the destination
     tape will be identical to that used on the source tape.
     Copying a tape will yield the same output as if just print-
     ing the sizes.

     The --ss option allows you to specify a maximum block size.
     The --vv option verifies that two tapes are identical.  The --cc
     option does the copy and then verifies that the two tapes
     are identical.
