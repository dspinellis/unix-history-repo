     _B_i_f_f informs the system whether you want to be notified when
     mail arrives during the current terminal session.	The com-
     mand

	  bbiiffff yy

     enables notification; the command

	  bbiiffff nn

     disables it.  When mail notification is enabled, the header
     and first few lines of the message will be printed on your
     screen whenever mail arrives.  A ``biff y'' command is often
     included in the file ._l_o_g_i_n or ._p_r_o_f_i_l_e to be executed at
     each login.

     _B_i_f_f operates asynchronously.  For synchronous notification
     use the MAIL variable of _s_h(1) or the _m_a_i_l variable of
     _c_s_h(1).
