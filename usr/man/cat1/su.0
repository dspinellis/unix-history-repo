     _S_u demands the password of the specified _u_s_e_r_i_d, and if it
     is given, changes to that _u_s_e_r_i_d and invokes the Shell _s_h(1)
     or _c_s_h(1) without changing the current directory.	The user
     environment is unchanged except for HOME and SHELL, which
     are taken from the password file for the user being substi-
     tuted (see _e_n_v_i_r_o_n(7)).  The new user ID stays in force
     until the Shell exits.

     If no _u_s_e_r_i_d is specified, ``root'' is assumed.  Only users
     in the ``wheel'' group (group 0) can _s_u to ``root'', even
     with the root password.  To remind the super-user of his
     responsibilities, the Shell substitutes `#' for its usual
     prompt.

     The --ff option prevents _c_s_h(1) from executing the .cshrc
     file; thus making _s_u start up faster.

     The -- option simulates a full login.
