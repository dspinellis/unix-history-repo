     _R_u_p_t_i_m_e gives a status line like _u_p_t_i_m_e for each machine on
     the local network; these are formed from packets broadcast
     by each host on the network once a minute.

     Machines for which no status report has been received for 11
     minutes are shown as being down.

     Users idle an hour or more are not counted unless the --aa
     flag is given.

     Normally, the listing is sorted by host name.  The --ll ,, --tt ,,
     and --uu flags specify sorting by load average, uptime, and
     number of users, respectively.  The --rr flag reverses the
     sort order.
