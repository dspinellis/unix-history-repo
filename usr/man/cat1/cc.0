     _C_c is the UNIX C compiler.  _C_c accepts several types of
     arguments:

     Arguments whose names end with `.c' are taken to be C source
     programs; they are compiled, and each object program is left
     on the file whose name is that of the source with `.o' sub-
     stituted for `.c'.  The `.o' file is normally deleted, how-
     ever, if a single C program is compiled and loaded all at
     one go.

     In the same way, arguments whose names end with `.s' are
     taken to be assembly source programs and are assembled, pro-
     ducing a `.o' file.

     The following options are interpreted by _c_c.  See _l_d(1) for
     load-time options.

     --cc      Suppress the loading phase of the compilation, and
	     force an object file to be produced even if only one
	     program is compiled.

     --gg      Have the compiler produce additional symbol table
	     information for _d_b_x(1).  Also pass the --llgg flag to
	     _l_d(1).

     --ggoo     Have the compiler produce additional symbol table
	     information for the obsolete debugger _s_d_b(1).  Also
	     pass the --llgg flag to _l_d(1).

     --ww      Suppress warning diagnostics.

     --pp      Arrange for the compiler to produce code which
	     counts the number of times each routine is called.
	     If loading takes place, replace the standard startup
	     routine by one which automatically calls _m_o_n_i_t_o_r(3)
	     at the start and arranges to write out a _m_o_n._o_u_t
	     file at normal termination of execution of the
	     object program.  An execution profile can then be
	     generated by use of _p_r_o_f(1).

     --ppgg     Causes the compiler to produce counting code in the
	     manner of --pp,, but invokes a run-time recording
	     mechanism that keeps more extensive statistics and
	     produces a _g_m_o_n._o_u_t file at normal termination.
	     Also, a profiling library is searched, in lieu of

	     the standard C library.  An execution profile can
	     then be generated by  use of _g_p_r_o_f(1).

     --OO      Invoke an object-code improver.

     --RR      Passed on to _a_s, making initialized variables shared
	     and read-only.

     --SS      Compile the named C programs, and leave the
	     assembler-language output on corresponding files
	     suffixed `.s'.

     --MM      Run only the macro preprocessor on the named C pro-
	     grams, requesting it to generate Makefile dependen-
	     cies and send the result to the standard output.

     --EE      Run only the macro preprocessor on the named C pro-
	     grams, and send the result to the standard output.

     --CC      prevent the macro preprocessor from eliding com-
	     ments.

     --oo _o_u_t_p_u_t
	     Name the final output file _o_u_t_p_u_t.  If this option
	     is used the file `a.out' will be left undisturbed.

     --DD_n_a_m_e=_d_e_f
     --DD_n_a_m_e  Define the _n_a_m_e to the preprocessor, as if by
	     `#define'.  If no definition is given, the name is
	     defined as "1".

     --UU_n_a_m_e  Remove any initial definition of _n_a_m_e.

     --II_d_i_r   `#include' files whose names do not begin with `/'
	     are always sought first in the directory of the _f_i_l_e
	     argument, then in directories named in --II options,
	     then in directories on a standard list.

     --LL_d_i_r   Library archives are sought first in directories
	     named in --LL options, then in directories on a stan-
	     dard list.

     --ff      Use an alternate compiler which does not convert
	     expressions involving only floats to double. This
	     does not conform to the standard which states that
	     all intermediate results should be converted to dou-
	     ble but does provide a speed improvement for pro-
	     grams which don't require full double precision.
	     This option also makes rreeggiisstteerr ffllooaatt variables work
	     appropriately.

	     Find substitute compiler passes in the files named
	     _s_t_r_i_n_g with the suffixes cpp, ccom and c2.  If
	     _s_t_r_i_n_g is empty, use a standard backup version.

     --tt[pp001122]
	     Find only the designated compiler passes in the
	     files whose names are constructed by a --BB option.
	     In the absence of a --BB option, the _s_t_r_i_n_g is taken
	     to be `/usr/c/'.

     Other arguments are taken to be either loader option argu-
     ments, or C-compatible object programs, typically produced
     by an earlier _c_c run, or perhaps libraries of C-compatible
     routines.	These programs, together with the results of any
     compilations specified, are loaded (in the order given) to
     produce an executable program with name aa..oouutt..
