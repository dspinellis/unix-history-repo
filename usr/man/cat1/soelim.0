     soelim - eliminate .so's from nroff input

     _S_o_e_l_i_m reads the specified files or the standard input and
     performs the textual inclusion implied by the _n_r_o_f_f direc-
     tives of the form

	  .so somefile

     when they appear at the beginning of input lines.	This is
     useful since programs such as _t_b_l do not normally do this;
     it allows the placement of individual tables in separate
     files to be run as a part of a large document.

     An argument consisting of a single minus (--) is taken to be
     a file name corresponding to the standard input.

     Note that inclusion can be suppressed by using `'' instead
     of `.', i.e.

	  'so /usr/lib/tmac.s

     A sample usage of _s_o_e_l_i_m would be

	  soelim exum?.n | tbl | nroff -ms | col | lpr

BBUUGGSS
     The format of the source commands must involve no strange-
     ness - exactly one blank must precede and no blanks follow
     the file name.
