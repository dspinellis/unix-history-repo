     rcp - remote file copy

     _R_c_p copies files between machines.  Each _f_i_l_e or _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
     argument is either a remote file name of the form
     ``rhost:path'', or a local file name (containing no `:'
     characters, or a `/' before any `:'s).

     If the --rr option is specified and any of the source files
     are directories, _r_c_p copies each subtree rooted at that
     name; in this case the destination must be a directory.

     By default, the mode and owner of _f_i_l_e_2 are preserved if it
     already existed; otherwise the mode of the source file modi-
     fied by the _u_m_a_s_k(2) on the destination host is used.  The
     --pp option causes _r_c_p to attempt to preserve (duplicate) in
     its copies the modification times and modes of the source
     files, ignoring the _u_m_a_s_k.

     If _p_a_t_h is not a full path name, it is interpreted relative
     to your login directory on _r_h_o_s_t.	A _p_a_t_h on a remote host
     may be quoted (using \, ", or ') so that the metacharacters
     are interpreted remotely.

     _R_c_p does not prompt for passwords; your current local user
     name must exist on _r_h_o_s_t and allow remote command execution
     via _r_s_h(1C).

     _R_c_p handles third party copies, where neither source nor
     target files are on the current machine.  Hostnames may also
     take the form ``rname@rhost'' to use _r_n_a_m_e rather than the
     current user name on the remote host.

BBUUGGSS
     Doesn't detect all cases where the target of a copy might be
     a file in cases where only a directory should be legal.

     Is confused by any output generated by commands in a .login,
     .profile, or .cshrc file on the remote host.

     The destination user and hostname may have to be specified
     as ``rhost.rname'' when the destination machine is running
     the 4.2BSD version of _r_c_p.
