     _P_r produces a printed listing of one or more _f_i_l_e_s. The out-
     put is separated into pages headed by a date, the name of
     the file or a specified header, and the page number.  If
     there are no file arguments, _p_r prints its standard input.

     Options apply to all following files but may be reset
     between files:

     --_n   Produce _n-column output.

     ++_n   Begin printing with page _n.

     --hh   Take the next argument as a page header.

     --ww_n  For purposes of multi-column output, take the width of
	  the page to be _n characters instead of the default 72.

     --ff   Use formfeeds instead of newlines to separate pages.	A
	  formfeed is assumed to use up two blank lines at the
	  top of a page.  (Thus this option does not affect the
	  effective page length.)

     --ll_n  Take the length of the page to be _n lines instead of
	  the default 66.

     --tt   Do not print the 5-line header or the 5-line trailer
	  normally supplied for each page.

     --ss_c  Separate columns by the single character _c instead of
	  by the appropriate amount of white space.  A missing _c
	  is taken to be a tab.

     --mm   Print all _f_i_l_e_s simultaneously, each in one column,

     Inter-terminal messages via _w_r_i_t_e(1) are forbidden during a
     _p_r.

     There are no diagnostics when _p_r is printing on a terminal.
