.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Diction
finds all sentences in a document that contain phrases
from a data base of bad or wordy diction.
Each phrase is bracketed with [ ].
Because
.I diction
runs
.I deroff
before looking at the text, formatting
header files should be included as part of the input.
The default macro package
.B \-ms
may be overridden with the flag
.B \-mm.
The flag
.B \-ml
which causes 
.B deroff
to skip lists, should be used if the document contains many lists of
non-sentences.
The user may supply her/his own pattern file to be used in addition to the default file
with
.B \-f
.I pfile.
If the flag
.B \-n
is also supplied the default file will be suppressed.
.PP
.I Explain
is an interactive thesaurus for the phrases found by diction.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
deroff(1)
.SH BUGS
Use of non-standard formatting macros may cause
incorrect sentence breaks.
In particular,
.I diction
doesn't grok
.B \-me.
