.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cat
[
.B \-u
] file ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Cat
reads each
.I file
in sequence and writes it on the standard output.
Thus
.IP
cat file
.LP
prints the file and
.IP
cat file1 file2 >file3
.LP
concatenates the first two files and places the result
on the third.
.PP
If no
.I file
is given, or if the argument `\-' is encountered,
.I cat 
reads from the standard input.
Output is buffered in 512-byte blocks unless the
standard output is a terminal or the
.B \-u
option is present.
.SH SEE ALSO
pr(1), cp(1)
.SH BUGS
Beware of `cat a b >a' and `cat a b >b', which
destroy input files before reading them.
