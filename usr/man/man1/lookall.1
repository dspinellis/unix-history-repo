.TH LOOKALL 1
.SH NAME
lookall \- look through all text files on UNIX
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lookall
[
.BI \-C n
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Lookall
accepts keywords from the standard input, performs
a search similar to that of
.IR  refer (1),
and writes the result on the standard output.
.I Lookall
consults, however, an index to all the text files on
the system rather than just bibliographies.
Only the first 50
words of each file (roughly) were used to
make the indexes.
Blank lines are taken as delimiters between queries.
.PP
The
.BI -C n
option
specifies a coordination level search: up to
.IR n
keywords may be missing
from the answers, and the answers are listed
with those containing the most keywords first.
.PP
The command sequence in
.I /usr/dict/lookall/makindex
regenerates the index.
.SH FILES
The directory
.I /usr/dict/lookall
contains the index files.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
`Warning: index precedes file ...'
means that a file has been changed since the index was made
and it may be retrieved (or not retrieved) erroneously.
.SH BUGS
Coordination level searching doesn't work as described: only
those acceptable items with the smallest number of
missing keywords are retreived.
