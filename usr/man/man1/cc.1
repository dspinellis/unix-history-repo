.SH NAME
cc \- C compiler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cc
[ option ] ... file ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Cc
is the UNIX C compiler.
.I Cc
accepts several types of arguments:
.PP
Arguments whose names end with `.c' are taken to be
C source programs; they are compiled, and
each object program is left on the file
whose name is that of the source with `.o' substituted
for `.c'.
The `.o' file is normally deleted, however, if a single
C program is compiled and loaded all at one go.
.PP
In the same way,
arguments whose names end with `.s' are taken to be assembly source programs
and are assembled, producing a `.o' file.
.PP
The following options are interpreted by
.IR cc .
See
.IR ld (1)
for load-time options.
.TP 8
.B \-c
Suppress the loading phase of the compilation, and force
an object file to be produced even if only one program is compiled.
.TP
.B \-g
Have the compiler produce additional symbol table information
for 
.IR dbx (1).
Also pass the
.B \-lg
flag to
.IR ld (1).
.TP
.B \-go
Have the compiler produce additional symbol table information
for 
.IR adb (1)
or
.IR sdb (1).
Also pass the
.B \-lg
flag to
.IR ld (1).
.TP
.B \-w
Suppress warning diagnostics.
.TP
.B \-p
Arrange for the compiler to produce code
which counts the number of times each routine is called.
If loading takes place, replace the standard startup
routine by one which automatically calls
.IR monitor (3)
at the start and arranges to write out a
.I mon.out
file at normal termination of execution of the object program.
Also, a profiling library is searched, in lieu of the standard C library.
An execution profile can then be generated by
use of
.IR  prof (1).
.TP
.B \-pg
Causes the compiler to produce counting code in the manner of
.B \-p,
but invokes a run-time recording mechanism that keeps more
extensive statistics and produces a 
.I gmon.out
file at normal termination.
An execution profile can then be generated by  use of
.IR gprof (1).
.TP
.SM
.B \-O
Invoke an
object-code improver.
.TP
.SM
.B \-R
Passed on to
.I as,
making initialized variables shared and read-only.
.TP
.SM
.B \-S
Compile the named C programs, and leave the
assembler-language output on corresponding files suffixed `.s'.
.TP
.SM
.B \-E
Run only the macro preprocessor
on the named C programs, and send the result to the
standard output.
.TP
.SM
.B \-C
prevent the macro preprocessor from eliding comments.
.TP
.BI \-o " output"
Name the final output file
.IR output .
If this option is used the file `a.out' will be left undisturbed.
.TP
.SM
.BI \-D name=def
.br
.ns
.TP
.SM
.BI \-D \*Sname
Define the
.I name
to the preprocessor,
as if by
`#define'.
If no definition is given, the name is defined as "1".
.TP
.SM
.BI \-U \*Sname
Remove any initial definition of
.IR name .
.TP
.SM
.BI \-I \*Sdir
`#include' files
whose names do not begin with `/' are always
sought first in the directory 
of the
.I file
argument,
then in directories named in 
.B \-I
options,
then in directories on a standard list.
.TP
.SM
.BI \-B \*Sstring
Find substitute compiler passes in the files named
.I string
with the suffixes cpp, ccom and c2.
If 
.I string 
is empty, use a standard backup version.
.TP
.BR \-t [ p012 ]
Find only the designated compiler passes in the
files whose names are constructed by a
.B \-B
option.
In the absence of a
.B \-B 
option, the
.I string
is taken to be `/usr/c/'.
.PP
Other arguments
are taken
to be either loader option arguments, or C-compatible
object programs, typically produced by an earlier
.I cc
run,
or perhaps libraries of C-compatible routines.
These programs, together with the results of any
compilations specified, are loaded (in the order
given) to produce an executable program with name
.B a.out.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The diagnostics produced by C itself are intended to be
self-explanatory.
Occasional messages may be produced by the assembler
or loader.
.SH BUGS
(VAX only) The compiler currently ignores advice to put 
\fBchar\fR, \fBunsigned char\fR,
\fBshort\fR or \fBunsigned short\fR variables in registers.  It previously
produced poor, and in some cases incorrect, code for such declarations.
.br
(SUN only) There are currently two floating-point formats,
trading off precision and range with speed. The default C floating point
is fast.
To produce C modules using the alternate floating format, you must give
the 
.B \-f
flag when compiling or linking using cc.
This will go away very soon.
