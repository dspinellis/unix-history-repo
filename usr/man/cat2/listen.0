     listen - listen for connections on a socket

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     To accept connections, a socket is first created with
     _s_o_c_k_e_t(2), a willingness to accept incoming connections and
     a queue limit for incoming connections are specified with
     _l_i_s_t_e_n(2), and then the connections are accepted with
     _a_c_c_e_p_t(2).  The _l_i_s_t_e_n call applies only to sockets of type
     SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_SEQPACKET.

     The _b_a_c_k_l_o_g parameter defines the maximum length the queue
     of pending connections may grow to.  If a connection request
     arrives with the queue full the client may receive an error
     with an indication of ECONNREFUSED, or, if the underlying
     protocol supports retransmission, the request may be ignored
     so that retries may succeed.

     A 0 return value indicates success; -1 indicates an error.

EERRRROORRSS
     The call fails if:

     [EBADF]		 The argument _s is not a valid descrip-
			 tor.

     [ENOTSOCK]          The argument _s is not a socket.

     [EOPNOTSUPP]	 The socket is not of a type that sup-
			 ports the operation _l_i_s_t_e_n.

     accept(2), connect(2), socket(2)

BBUUGGSS
     The _b_a_c_k_l_o_g is currently limited (silently) to 5.
