     These routines provide various interfaces to the _e_x_e_c_v_e sys-
     tem call.	Refer to _e_x_e_c_v_e(2) for a description of their
     properties; only brief descriptions are provided here.

     _E_x_e_c in all its forms overlays the calling process with the
     named file, then transfers to the entry point of the core
     image of the file.  There can be no return from a successful
     exec; the calling core image is lost.

     The _n_a_m_e argument is a pointer to the name of the file to be
     executed.	The pointers _a_r_g[_0], _a_r_g[_1] ...  address null-
     terminated strings.  Conventionally _a_r_g[_0] is the name of
     the file.

     Two interfaces are available.  _e_x_e_c_l is useful when a known
     file with known arguments is being called; the arguments to
     _e_x_e_c_l are the character strings constituting the file and
     the arguments; the first argument is conventionally the same
     as the file name (or its last component).	A 0 argument must
     end the argument list.

     The _e_x_e_c_v version is useful when the number of arguments is
     unknown in advance; the arguments to _e_x_e_c_v are the name of
     the file to be executed and a vector of strings containing
     the arguments.  The last argument string must be followed by
     a 0 pointer.

     The _e_x_e_c_t version is used when the executed file is to be
     manipulated with _p_t_r_a_c_e(2).  The program is forced to single
     step a single instruction giving the parent an opportunity
     to manipulate its state.  On the VAX-11 this is done by set-
     ting the trace bit in the process status longword.

     When a C program is executed, it is called as follows:

	  main(argc, argv, envp)
	  int argc;
	  char **argv, **envp;

     where _a_r_g_c is the argument count and _a_r_g_v is an array of
     character pointers to the arguments themselves.  As indi-
     cated, _a_r_g_c is conventionally at least one and the first
     member of the array points to a string containing the name
     of the file.

     _A_r_g_v is directly usable in another _e_x_e_c_v because _a_r_g_v[_a_r_g_c]
     is 0.

     _E_n_v_p is a pointer to an array of strings that constitute the
     _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t of the process.  Each string consists of a name,
     an "=", and a null-terminated value.  The array of pointers
     is terminated by a null pointer.  The shell _s_h(1) passes an
     environment entry for each global shell variable defined
     when the program is called.  See _e_n_v_i_r_o_n(7) for some conven-
     tionally used names.  The C run-time start-off routine
     places a copy of _e_n_v_p in the global cell _e_n_v_i_r_o_n, which is
     used by _e_x_e_c_v and _e_x_e_c_l to pass the environment to any sub-
     programs executed by the current program.

     _E_x_e_c_l_p and _e_x_e_c_v_p are called with the same arguments as
     _e_x_e_c_l and _e_x_e_c_v, but duplicate the shell's actions in
     searching for an executable file in a list of directories.
     The directory list is obtained from the environment.

     If the file cannot be found, if it is not executable, if it
     does not start with a valid magic number (see _a._o_u_t(5)), if
     maximum memory is exceeded, or if the arguments require too
     much space, a return constitutes the diagnostic; the return
     value is -1.  Even for the super-user, at least one of the
     execute-permission bits must be set for a file to be exe-
     cuted.

BBUUGGSS
     If _e_x_e_c_v_p is called to execute a file that turns out to be a
     shell command file, and if it is impossible to execute the
     shell, the values of _a_r_g_v[_0] and _a_r_g_v[-_1] will be modified
     before return.
