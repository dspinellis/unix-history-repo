     _Q_s_o_r_t is an implementation of the quicker-sort algorithm.
     The first argument is a pointer to the base of the data; the
     second is the number of elements; the third is the width of
     an element in bytes; the last is the name of the comparison
     routine to be called with two arguments which are pointers
     to the elements being compared.  The routine must return an
     integer less than, equal to, or greater than 0 according as
     the first argument is to be considered less than, equal to,
     or greater than the second.

     The comparison routine may not itself call _q_s_o_r_t.
