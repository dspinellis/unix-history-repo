     _D_i_s_k_p_a_r_t is used to calculate the disk partition sizes based
     on the default rules used at Berkeley.  If the --pp option is
     supplied, tables suitable for inclusion in a device driver
     are produced.  If the --dd option is supplied, an entry suit-
     able for inclusion in the disk description file /_e_t_c/_d_i_s_k_t_a_b
     is generated; c.f.  _d_i_s_k_t_a_b(5).  On disks that use _b_a_d_1_4_4-
     style bad-sector forwarding, space is normally left in the
     last partition on the disk for a bad sector forwarding
     table, although this space is not reflected in the tables
     produced.	The space reserved is one track for the repli-
     cated copies of the table and sufficient tracks to hold a
     pool of 126 sectors to which bad sectors are mapped.  For
     more information, see _b_a_d_1_4_4(8).  The size of the disk may
     be limited with the --ss option, specifying the amount of the
     disk to be used.  This option is intended for other con-
     trollers that reserve some space at the end of the disk for
     bad-sector replacements or other control areas, even if not
     a multiple of cylinders.

     The disk partition sizes are based on the total amount of
     space on the disk as given in the table below (all values
     are supplied in units of sectors).  The `c' partition is, by
     convention, used to access the entire physical disk.  The
     device driver tables include the space reserved for the bad
     sector forwarding table in the `c' partition; those used in
     the disktab and default formats exclude reserved tracks.  In
     normal operation, either the `g' partition is used, or the
     `d', `e', and `f' partitions are used.  The `g' and `f' par-
     titions are variable-sized, occupying whatever space remains
     after allocation of the fixed sized partitions.  If the disk
     is smaller than 20 Megabytes, then _d_i_s_k_p_a_r_t aborts with the
     message ``disk too small, calculate by hand''.

     If an unknown disk type is specified, _d_i_s_k_p_a_r_t will prompt
     for the required disk geometry information.

     Most default partition sizes are based on historical
     artifacts (e.g. RP06), and may result in unsatisfactory lay-
     outs.

     When using the -d flag, alternate disk names are not
     included in the output.
