     _U_u_c_l_e_a_n will scan the spool directory for files with the

     the specified number of hours.

     The following options are available.

     --pp_p_r_e   Scan for files with _p_r_e as the file prefix.  Up to
	     10 --pp arguments may be specified.

     --nn_t_i_m_e  Files whose age is more than _t_i_m_e hours will be
	     deleted if the prefix test is satisfied.  (default
	     time is 72 hours)

     --mm      Send mail to the owner of the file when it is
	     deleted.

     --dd_s_u_b_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
	     Only the specified subdirectory will be cleaned.

     This program will typically be run daily by _c_r_o_n(8).
