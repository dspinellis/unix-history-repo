     _C_o_n_f_i_g builds a set of system configuration files from a
     short file which describes the sort of system that is being
     configured.  It also takes as input a file which tells _c_o_n_-
     _f_i_g what files are needed to generate a system.  This can be
     augmented by a configuration specific set of files that give
     alternate files for a specific machine.  (see the FILES sec-
     tion below) If the --pp option is supplied, _c_o_n_f_i_g will con-
     figure a system for profiling; c.f.  _k_g_m_o_n(8) and _g_p_r_o_f(1).

     _C_o_n_f_i_g should be run from the ccoonnff subdirectory of the sys-
     tem source (usually /sys/conf).  Its argument is the name of
     a system configuration file containing device specifica-
     tions, configuration options and other system parameters for
     one system configuration.	_C_o_n_f_i_g assumes that there is
     already a directory ../_S_Y_S_T_E_M__N_A_M_E created and it places all
     its output files in there. The output of _c_o_n_f_i_g consists of
     a number of files; for the VAX, they are: iiooccoonnff..cc contains
     a description of what I/O devices are attached to the sys-
     tem,; uubbgglluuee..ss contains a set of interrupt service routines
     for devices attached to the UNIBUS; uubbvveecc..ss contains offsets
     into a structure used for counting per-device interrupts;
     MMaakkeeffiillee is a file used by _m_a_k_e(1) in building the system; a
     set of header files contain definitions of the number of
     various devices that will be compiled into the system; and a
     set of swap configuration files contain definitions for the
     disk areas to be used for swapping, the root file system,
     argument processing, and system dumps.

     After running _c_o_n_f_i_g, it is necessary to run ``make depend''
     in the directory where the new makefile was created.  _C_o_n_f_i_g
     prints a reminder of this when it completes.

     If any other error messages are produced by _c_o_n_f_i_g, the
     problems in the configuration file should be corrected and
     _c_o_n_f_i_g should be run again.  Attempts to compile a system
     that had configuration errors are likely to meet with
     failure.
