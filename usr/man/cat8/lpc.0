     _L_p_c is used by  the  system  administrator  to  control  the
     operation	of the line printer system. For each line printer
     configured in /etc/printcap, _l_p_c may be used to:

     o+	  disable or enable a printer,

     o+	  disable or enable a printer's spooling queue,

     o+	  rearrange the order of jobs in a spooling queue,

     o+	  find the  status  of	printers,  and	their  associated
	  spooling queues and printer dameons.

     Without any arguments, _l_p_c will prompt for commands from the
     standard  input.	If arguments are supplied, _l_p_c interprets
     the first argument as a command and the remaining	arguments
     as  parameters  to  the  command.	The standard input may be
     redirected causing _l_p_c to read commands from file.  Commands
     may  be  abreviated; the following is the list of recognized
     commands.

     ? [ command ... ]

     help [ command ... ]
	  Print a short description of each command specified  in
	  the  argument  list,	or,  if no arguments are given, a
	  list of the recognized commands.

     abort { all | printer ... }
	  Terminate an active spooling daemon on the  local  host
	  immediately  and  then disable printing (preventing new
	  daemons from being started by _l_p_r)  for  the	specified
	  printers.

     clean { all | printer ... }
	  Remove any temporary files,  data  files,  and  control
	  files  that cannot be printed (i.e., do not form a com-
	  plete printer job) from the specified printer  queue(s)
	  on the local machine.

     disable { all | printer ... }
	  Turn the specified printer queues off.   This  prevents
	  new  printer	jobs from being entered into the queue by
	  _l_p_r.

     down { all | printer } message ...
	  Turn the specified printer queue off, disable  printing
	  and put _m_e_s_s_a_g_e in the printer status file. The message
	  doesn't need to be quoted, the remaining arguments  are
	  treated  like _e_c_h_o(1).  This is normally used to take a
	  printer down and let others know why (lpq will indicate
	  the printer is down and print the status message).

     enable { all | printer ... }
	  Enable spooling on  the  local  queue  for  the  listed
	  printers.  This  will  allow _l_p_r to put new jobs in the
	  spool queue.

     exit

     quit
	  Exit from lpc.

     restart { all | printer ... }
	  Attempt to start a new printer daemon. This  is  useful
	  when	some  abnormal condition causes the daemon to die
	  unexpectedly leaving	jobs  in  the  queue.	_L_p_q  will
	  report that there is no daemon present when this condi-
	  tion occurs. If the user  is	the  super-user,  try  to
	  abort  the current daemon first (i.e., kill and restart
	  a stuck daemon).

     start { all | printer ... }
	  Enable printing and start a  spooling  daemon  for  the
	  listed printers.

     status { all | printer ... }
	  Display the status of daemons and queues on  the  local
	  machine.

     stop { all | printer ... }
	  Stop a spooling daemon after the current job	completes
	  and disable printing.

     topq printer [ jobnum ... ] [ user ... ]
	  Place the jobs in the order listed at the  top  of  the
	  printer queue.

     up { all | printer ... }
	  Enable everything  and  start  a  new  printer  daemon.
	  Undoes the effects of _d_o_w_n.

FFIILLEESS
     /etc/printcap	     printer description file
     /usr/spool/*	     spool directories
     /usr/spool/*/lock	     lock file for queue control
