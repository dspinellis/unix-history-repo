     _T_e_r_m_c_a_p is a data base describing terminals, used, _e._g., by
     _v_i(1) and _c_u_r_s_e_s(3X).  Terminals are described in _t_e_r_m_c_a_p by
     giving a set of capabilities that they have and by describ-
     ing how operations are performed.	Padding requirements and
     initialization sequences are included in _t_e_r_m_c_a_p.

     Entries in _t_e_r_m_c_a_p consist of a number of `:'-separated
     fields.  The first entry for each terminal gives the names
     that are known for the terminal, separated by `|' charac-
     ters.  The first name is always two characters long and is
     used by older systems which store the terminal type in a
     16-bit word in a system-wide data base.  The second name
     given is the most common abbreviation for the terminal, the
     last name given should be a long name fully identifying the
     terminal, and all others are understood as synonyms for the
     terminal name.  All names but the first and last should be
     in lower case and contain no blanks; the last name may well
     contain upper case and blanks for readability.

     Terminal names (except for the last, verbose entry) should
     be chosen using the following conventions.  The particular
     piece of hardware making up the terminal should have a root
     name chosen, thus "hp2621".  This name should not contain
     hyphens.  Modes that the hardware can be in or user prefer-
     ences should be indicated by appending a hyphen and an indi-
     cator of the mode.  Therefore, a "vt100" in 132-column mode
     would be "vt100-w".  The following suffixes should be used
     where possible:

     SSuuffffiixx   MMeeaanniinngg					EExxaammppllee
     -w       Wide mode (more than 80 columns)		vt100-w
     -am      With automatic margins (usually default)	vt100-am
     -nam     Without automatic margins                 vt100-nam
     -_n       Number of lines on the screen		aaa-60
     -na      No arrow keys (leave them in local)	concept100-na
     -_np      Number of pages of memory                 concept100-4p
     -rv      Reverse video				concept100-rv

     The characters in the _N_o_t_e_s field in the table have the fol-
     lowing meanings (more than one may apply to a capability):

     N	 indicates numeric parameter(s)
     P	 indicates that padding may be specified
     *	 indicates that padding may be based on the number of lines affected

     o	 indicates capability is obsolete

     "Obsolete" capabilities have no _t_e_r_m_i_n_f_o equivalents, since
     they were considered useless, or are subsumed by other capa-
     bilities.	New software should not rely on them at all.

     Capabilities in _t_e_r_m_c_a_p are of three types: Boolean capabil-
     ities, which indicate particular features that the terminal
     has; numeric capabilities, giving the size of the display or
     the size of other attributes; and string capabilities, which
     give character sequences that can be used to perform partic-
     ular terminal operations.	All capabilities have two-letter
     codes.  For instance, the fact that the Concept has
     _a_u_t_o_m_a_t_i_c _m_a_r_g_i_n_s (_i._e., an automatic return and linefeed
     when the end of a line is reached) is indicated by the
     Boolean capability aamm.  Hence the description of the Concept
     includes aamm.

     Numeric capabilities are followed by the character `#' then
     the value.  In the example above ccoo, which indicates the
     number of columns the display has, gives the value `80' for
     the Concept.

     Finally, string-valued capabilities, such as ccee (clear-to-
     end-of-line sequence) are given by the two-letter code, an
     `=', then a string ending at the next following `:'.  A
     delay in milliseconds may appear after the `=' in such a
     capability, which causes padding characters to be supplied
     by _t_p_u_t_s after the remainder of the string is sent to pro-
     vide this delay.  The delay can be either a number, _e._g.
     `20', or a number followed by an `*', _i._e., `3*'.	An `*'
     indicates that the padding required is proportional to the
     number of lines affected by the operation, and the amount
     given is the per-affected-line padding required.  (In the
     case of insert-character, the factor is still the number of
     _l_i_n_e_s affected; this is always 1 unless the terminal has iinn
     and the software uses it.) When an `*' is specified, it is
     sometimes useful to give a delay of the form `3.5' to
     specify a delay per line to tenths of milliseconds.  (Only
     one decimal place is allowed.)

     A number of escape sequences are provided in the string-
     valued capabilities for easy encoding of control characters
     there.  \\EE maps to an ESC character, ^^XX maps to a control-X
     for any appropriate X, and the sequences \\nn \\rr \\tt \\bb \\ff map
     to linefeed, return, tab, backspace, and formfeed, respec-
     tively.  Finally, characters may be given as three octal
     digits after a \\, and the characters ^^ and \\ may be given as
     \\^^ and \\\\.  If it is necessary to place a :: in a capability
     it must be escaped in octal as \\007722.  If it is necessary to
     place a NUL character in a string capability it must be
     encoded as \\220000.  (The routines that deal with _t_e_r_m_c_a_p use C

     strings and strip the high bits of the output very late, so
     that a \\220000 comes out as a \\000000 would.)

     Sometimes individual capabilities must be commented out.  To
     do this, put a period before the capability name.	For exam-
     ple, see the first ccrr and ttaa in the example above.

     We now outline how to prepare descriptions of terminals.
     The most effective way to prepare a terminal description is
     by imitating the description of a similar terminal in
     _t_e_r_m_c_a_p and to build up a description gradually, using par-
     tial descriptions with _v_i to check that they are correct.
     Be aware that a very unusual terminal may expose deficien-
     cies in the ability of the _t_e_r_m_c_a_p file to describe it or
     bugs in _v_i.  To easily test a new terminal description you
     are working on you can put it in your home directory in a
     file called ._t_e_r_m_c_a_p and programs will look there before
     looking in /_e_t_c/_t_e_r_m_c_a_p.  You can also set the environment
     variable TTEERRMMPPAATTHH to a list of absolute file pathnames
     (separated by spaces or colons), one of which contains the
     description you are working on, and programs will search
     them in the order listed, and nowhere else.  See
     _t_e_r_m_c_a_p(3X).  The TTEERRMMCCAAPP environment variable is usually
     set to the _t_e_r_m_c_a_p entry itself to avoid reading files when
     starting up a program.

     To get the padding for insert-line right (if the terminal
     manufacturer did not document it), a severe test is to use
     _v_i to edit /_e_t_c/_p_a_s_s_w_d at 9600 baud, delete roughly 16 lines
     from the middle of the screen, then hit the `u' key several
     times quickly.  If the display messes up, more padding is
     usually needed.  A similar test can be used for insert-
     character.

     The number of columns on each line of the display is given
     by the ccoo numeric capability.  If the display is a CRT, then
     the number of lines on the screen is given by the llii capa-
     bility.  If the display wraps around to the beginning of the
     next line when the cursor reaches the right margin, then it
     should have the aamm capability.  If the terminal can clear
     its screen, the code to do this is given by the ccll string
     capability.  If the terminal overstrikes (rather than clear-
     ing the position when a character is overwritten), it should
     have the ooss capability.  If the terminal is a printing ter-
     minal, with no soft copy unit, give it both hhcc and ooss.  (ooss
     applies to storage scope terminals, such as the Tektronix
     4010 series, as well as to hard copy and APL terminals.) If
     there is a code to move the cursor to the left edge of the



Printed 7/9/88		 1 November 1985			7






TERMCAP(5)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	       TERMCAP(5)



     current row, give this as ccrr.  (Normally this will be
     carriage-return, ^^MM.) If there is a code to produce an audi-
     ble signal (bell, beep, _e_t_c.), give this as bbll.

     If there is a code (such as backspace) to move the cursor
     one position to the left, that capability should be given as
     llee.  Similarly, codes to move to the right, up, and down
     should be given as nndd, uupp, and ddoo, respectively.  These
     _l_o_c_a_l _c_u_r_s_o_r _m_o_t_i_o_n_s should not alter the text they pass
     over; for example, you would not normally use "nd= " unless
     the terminal has the ooss capability, because the space would
     erase the character moved over.

     A very important point here is that the local cursor motions
     encoded in _t_e_r_m_c_a_p have undefined behavior at the left and
     top edges of a CRT display.  Programs should never attempt
     to backspace around the left edge, unless bbww is given, and
     never attempt to go up off the top using local cursor
     motions.

     In order to scroll text up, a program goes to the bottom
     left corner of the screen and sends the ssff (index) string.
     To scroll text down, a program goes to the top left corner
     of the screen and sends the ssrr (reverse index) string.  The
     strings ssff and ssrr have undefined behavior when not on their
     respective corners of the screen.	Parameterized versions of
     the scrolling sequences are SSFF and SSRR, which have the same
     semantics as ssff and ssrr except that they take one parameter
     and scroll that many lines.  They also have undefined
     behavior except at the appropriate corner of the screen.

     The aamm capability tells whether the cursor sticks at the
     right edge of the screen when text is output there, but this
     does not necessarily apply to nndd from the last column.
     Leftward local motion is defined from the left edge only
     when bbww is given; then an llee from the left edge will move to
     the right edge of the previous row.  This is useful for
     drawing a box around the edge of the screen, for example.
     If the terminal has switch-selectable automatic margins, the
     _t_e_r_m_c_a_p description usually assumes that this feature is on,
     _i._e., aamm.	If the terminal has a command that moves to the
     first column of the next line, that command can be given as
     nnww (newline).  It is permissible for this to clear the
     remainder of the current line, so if the terminal has no
     correctly-working CR and LF it may still be possible to
     craft a working nnww out of one or both of them.

     These capabilities suffice to describe hardcopy and "glass-
     tty" terminals.  Thus the Teletype model 33 is described as

	     T3|tty33|33|tty|Teletype model 33:\

     Cursor addressing and other strings requiring parameters are
     described by a parameterized string capability, with
     _p_r_i_n_t_f(3S)-like escapes %%xx in it, while other characters are
     passed through unchanged.	For example, to address the cur-
     sor the ccmm capability is given, using two parameters: the
     row and column to move to.  (Rows and columns are numbered
     from zero and refer to the physical screen visible to the
     user, not to any unseen memory.  If the terminal has
     memory-relative cursor addressing, that can be indicated by
     an analogous CCMM capability.)

     The %% encodings have the following meanings:

	  %%   output `%'
	  %d   output value as in _p_r_i_n_t_f %d
	  %2   output value as in _p_r_i_n_t_f %2d
	  %3   output value as in _p_r_i_n_t_f %3d
	  %.   output value as in _p_r_i_n_t_f %c
	  %+_x  add _x to value, then do %.
	  %>_x_y if value > _x then add _y, no output
	  %r   reverse order of two parameters, no output
	  %i   increment by one, no output
	  %n   exclusive-or all parameters with 0140 (Datamedia 2500)
	  %B   BCD (16*(value/10)) + (value%10), no output
	  %D   Reverse coding (value - 2*(value%16)), no output (Delta Data)

     Consider the Hewlett-Packard 2645, which, to get to row 3
     and column 12, needs to be sent "\E&a12c03Y" padded for 6
     milliseconds.  Note that the order of the row and column
     coordinates is reversed here and that the row and column are
     sent as two-digit integers.  Thus its ccmm capability is
     "cm=6\E&%r%2c%2Y".

     The Microterm ACT-IV needs the current row and column sent
     simply encoded in binary preceded by a ^^TT, "cm=^T%.%.".
     Terminals that use "%." need to be able to backspace the
     cursor (llee) and to move the cursor up one line on the screen
     (uupp).  This is necessary because it is not always safe to
     transmit \\nn, ^^DD, and \\rr, as the system may change or discard
     them.  (Programs using _t_e_r_m_c_a_p must set terminal modes so
     that tabs are not expanded, so \\tt is safe to send.  This
     turns out to be essential for the Ann Arbor 4080.)

     A final example is the Lear Siegler ADM-3a, which offsets
     row and column by a blank character, thus "cm=\E=%+ %+ ".

TERMCAP(5)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	       TERMCAP(5)



     Row or column absolute cursor addressing can be given as
     single parameter capabilities cchh (horizontal position abso-
     lute) and ccvv (vertical position absolute).  Sometimes these
     are shorter than the more general two-parameter sequence (as
     with the Hewlett-Packard 2645) and can be used in preference
     to ccmm.  If there are parameterized local motions (_e._g., move
     _n positions to the right) these can be given as DDOO, LLEE, RRII,
     and UUPP with a single parameter indicating how many positions
     to move.  These are primarily useful if the terminal does
     not have ccmm, such as the Tektronix 4025.

     CCuurrssoorr MMoottiioonnss

     If the terminal has a fast way to home the cursor (to the
     very upper left corner of the screen), this can be given as
     hhoo.  Similarly, a fast way of getting to the lower left-hand
     corner can be given as llll; this may involve going up with uupp
     from the home position, but a program should never do this
     itself (unless llll does), because it can make no assumption
     about the effect of moving up from the home position.  Note
     that the home position is the same as cursor address (0,0):
     to the top left corner of the screen, not of memory.
     (Therefore, the "\EH" sequence on Hewlett-Packard terminals
     cannot be used for hhoo.)

     AArreeaa CClleeaarrss

     If the terminal can clear from the current position to the
     end of the line, leaving the cursor where it is, this should
     be given as ccee.  If the terminal can clear from the current
     position to the end of the display, this should be given as
     ccdd.  ccdd must only be invoked from the first column of a
     line.  (Therefore, it can be simulated by a request to
     delete a large number of lines, if a true ccdd is not avail-
     able.)

     IInnsseerrtt//DDeelleettee LLiinnee

     If the terminal can open a new blank line before the line
     containing the cursor, this should be given as aall; this must
     be invoked only from the first position of a line.  The cur-
     sor must then appear at the left of the newly blank line.
     If the terminal can delete the line that the cursor is on,
     this should be given as ddll; this must only be used from the
     first position on the line to be deleted.	Versions of aall
     and ddll which take a single parameter and insert or delete
     that many lines can be given as AALL and DDLL.  If the terminal
     has a settable scrolling region (like the VT100), the com-
     mand to set this can be described with the ccss capability,
     which takes two parameters: the top and bottom lines of the
     scrolling region.	The cursor position is, alas, undefined
     after using this command.	It is possible to get the effect

     of insert or delete line using this command - the sscc and rrcc
     (save and restore cursor) commands are also useful.  Insert-
     ing lines at the top or bottom of the screen can also be
     done using ssrr or ssff on many terminals without a true
     insert/delete line, and is often faster even on terminals
     with those features.

     If the terminal has the ability to define a window as part
     of memory which all commands affect, it should be given as
     the parameterized string wwii.  The four parameters are the
     starting and ending lines in memory and the starting and
     ending columns in memory, in that order.  (This _t_e_r_m_i_n_f_o
     capability is described for completeness.	It is unlikely
     that any _t_e_r_m_c_a_p-using program will support it.)

     If the terminal can retain display memory above the screen,
     then the ddaa capability should be given; if display memory
     can be retained below, then ddbb should be given.  These indi-
     cate that deleting a line or scrolling may bring non-blank
     lines up from below or that scrolling back with ssrr may bring
     down non-blank lines.

     There are two basic kinds of intelligent terminals with
     respect to insert/delete character that can be described
     using _t_e_r_m_c_a_p.  The most common insert/delete character
     operations affect only the characters on the current line
     and shift characters off the end of the line rigidly.  Other
     terminals, such as the Concept-100 and the Perkin Elmer Owl,
     make a distinction between typed and untyped blanks on the
     screen, shifting upon an insert or delete only to an untyped
     blank on the screen which is either eliminated or expanded
     to two untyped blanks.  You can determine the kind of termi-
     nal you have by clearing the screen then typing text
     separated by cursor motions.  Type "abc	def" using local
     cursor motions (not spaces) between the "abc" and the "def".
     Then position the cursor before the "abc" and put the termi-
     nal in insert mode.  If typing characters causes the rest of
     the line to shift rigidly and characters to fall off the
     end, then your terminal does not distinguish between blanks
     and untyped positions.  If the "abc" shifts over to the
     "def" which then move together around the end of the current
     line and onto the next as you insert, then you have the
     second type of terminal and should give the capability iinn,
     which stands for "insert null".  While these are two logi-
     cally separate attributes (one line _v_s. multi-line insert
     mode, and special treatment of untyped spaces), we have seen
     no terminals whose insert mode cannot be described with the
     single attribute.

TERMCAP(5)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	       TERMCAP(5)



     _T_e_r_m_c_a_p can describe both terminals that have an insert mode
     and terminals that send a simple sequence to open a blank
     position on the current line.  Give as iimm the sequence to
     get into insert mode.  Give as eeii the sequence to leave
     insert mode.  Now give as iicc any sequence that needs to be
     sent just before each character to be inserted.  Most termi-
     nals with a true insert mode will not give iicc; terminals
     that use a sequence to open a screen position should give it
     here.  (If your terminal has both, insert mode is usually
     preferable to iicc.	Do not give both unless the terminal
     actually requires both to be used in combination.) If post-
     insert padding is needed, give this as a number of mil-
     liseconds in iipp (a string option).  Any other sequence that
     may need to be sent after insertion of a single character
     can also be given in iipp.  If your terminal needs to be
     placed into an `insert mode' and needs a special code
     preceding each inserted character, then both iimm/eeii and iicc
     can be given, and both will be used.  The IICC capability,
     with one parameter _n, will repeat the effects of iicc _n times.

     It is occasionally necessary to move around while in insert
     mode to delete characters on the same line (_e._g., if there
     is a tab after the insertion position).  If your terminal
     allows motion while in insert mode, you can give the capa-
     bility mmii to speed up inserting in this case.  Omitting mmii
     will affect only speed.  Some terminals (notably
     Datamedia's) must not have mmii because of the way their
     insert mode works.

     Finally, you can specify ddcc to delete a single character, DDCC
     with one parameter _n to delete _n characters, and delete mode
     by giving ddmm and eedd to enter and exit delete mode (which is
     any mode the terminal needs to be placed in for ddcc to work).

     If your terminal has one or more kinds of display attri-
     butes, these can be represented in a number of different
     ways.  You should choose one display form as _s_t_a_n_d_o_u_t _m_o_d_e,
     representing a good high-contrast, easy-on-the-eyes format
     for highlighting error messages and other attention getters.
     (If you have a choice, reverse video plus half-bright is
     good, or reverse video alone.) The sequences to enter and
     exit standout mode are given as ssoo and ssee, respectively.  If
     the code to change into or out of standout mode leaves one
     or even two blank spaces or garbage characters on the
     screen, as the TVI 912 and Teleray 1061 do, then ssgg should
     be given to tell how many characters are left.

     Codes to begin underlining and end underlining can be given
     as uuss and uuee, respectively.  Underline mode change garbage
     is specified by uugg, similar to ssgg.  If the terminal has a



Printed 7/9/88		 1 November 1985		       12






TERMCAP(5)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	       TERMCAP(5)



     code to underline the current character and move the cursor
     one position to the right, such as the Microterm Mime, this
     can be given as uucc.

     Other capabilities to enter various highlighting modes
     include mmbb (blinking), mmdd (bold or extra bright), mmhh (dim or
     half-bright), mmkk (blanking or invisible text), mmpp (pro-
     tected), mmrr (reverse video), mmee (turn off _a_l_l attribute
     modes), aass (enter alternate character set mode), and aaee
     (exit alternate character set mode).  Turning on any of
     these modes singly may or may not turn off other modes.

     If there is a sequence to set arbitrary combinations of
     mode, this should be given as ssaa (set attributes), taking 9
     parameters.  Each parameter is either 0 or 1, as the
     corresponding attributes is on or off.  The 9 parameters
     are, in order: standout, underline, reverse, blink, dim,
     bold, blank, protect, and alternate character set.  Not all
     modes need be supported by ssaa, only those for which
     corresponding attribute commands exist.  (It is unlikely
     that a _t_e_r_m_c_a_p-using program will support this capability,
     which is defined for compatibility with _t_e_r_m_i_n_f_o.)

     Terminals with the "magic cookie" glitches (ssgg and uugg),
     rather than maintaining extra attribute bits for each char-
     acter cell, instead deposit special "cookies", or "garbage
     characters", when they receive mode-setting sequences, which
     affect the display algorithm.

     Some terminals, such as the Hewlett-Packard 2621, automati-
     cally leave standout mode when they move to a new line or
     when the cursor is addressed.  Programs using standout mode
     should exit standout mode on such terminals before moving
     the cursor or sending a newline.  On terminals where this is
     not a problem, the mmss capability should be present to say
     that this overhead is unnecessary.

     If the terminal has a way of flashing the screen to indicate
     an error quietly (a bell replacement), this can be given as
     vvbb; it must not move the cursor.

     If the cursor needs to be made more visible than normal when
     it is not on the bottom line (to change, for example, a
     non-blinking underline into an easier-to-find block or
     blinking underline), give this sequence as vvss.  If there is
     a way to make the cursor completely invisible, give that as
     vvii.  The capability vvee, which undoes the effects of both of
     these modes, should also be given.

     If your terminal correctly displays underlined characters
     (with no special codes needed) even though it does not over-
     strike, then you should give the capability uull.  If

     overstrikes are erasable with a blank, this should be indi-
     cated by giving eeoo.

     KKeeyyppaadd

     If the terminal has a keypad that transmits codes when the
     keys are pressed, this information can be given.  Note that
     it is not possible to handle terminals where the keypad only
     works in local mode (this applies, for example, to the
     unshifted Hewlett-Packard 2621 keys).  If the keypad can be
     set to transmit or not transmit, give these codes as kkss and
     kkee.  Otherwise the keypad is assumed to always transmit.
     The codes sent by the left-arrow, right-arrow, up-arrow,
     down-arrow, and home keys can be given as kkll, kkrr, kkuu, kkdd,
     and kkhh, respectively.  If there are function keys such as
     f0, f1, ..., f9, the codes they send can be given as kk00, kk11,
     kk99.  If these keys have labels other than the default f0
     through f9, the labels can be given as ll00, ll11, ll99.  The
     codes transmitted by certain other special keys can be
     given: kkHH (home down), kkbb (backspace), kkaa (clear all tabs),
     kktt (clear the tab stop in this column), kkCC (clear screen or
     erase), kkDD (delete character), kkLL (delete line), kkMM (exit
     insert mode), kkEE (clear to end of line), kkSS (clear to end of
     screen), kkII (insert character or enter insert mode), kkAA
     (insert line), kkNN (next page), kkPP (previous page), kkFF
     (scroll forward/down), kkRR (scroll backward/up), and kkTT (set
     a tab stop in this column).  In addition, if the keypad has
     a 3 by 3 array of keys including the four arrow keys, then
     the other five keys can be given as KK11, KK22, KK33, KK44, and KK55.
     These keys are useful when the effects of a 3 by 3 direc-
     tional pad are needed.  The obsolete kkoo capability formerly
     used to describe "other" function keys has been completely
     supplanted by the above capabilities.

     The mmaa entry is also used to indicate arrow keys on termi-
     nals that have single-character arrow keys.  It is obsolete
     but still in use in version 2 of _v_i which must be run on
     some minicomputers due to memory limitations.  This field is
     redundant with kkll, kkrr, kkuu, kkdd, and kkhh.  It consists of
     groups of two characters.	In each group, the first charac-
     ter is what an arrow key sends, and the second character is
     the corresponding _v_i command.  These commands are hh for kkll,
     jj for kkdd, kk for kkuu, ll for kkrr, and HH for kkhh.  For example,
     the Mime would have "ma=^Hh^Kj^Zk^Xl" indicating arrow keys
     left (^H), down (^K), up (^Z), and right (^X).  (There is no
     home key on the Mime.)

     If the terminal needs to be in a special mode when running a
     program that uses these capabilities, the codes to enter and
     exit this mode can be given as ttii and ttee.	This arises, for

     example, from terminals like the Concept with more than one
     page of memory.  If the terminal has only memory-relative
     cursor addressing and not screen-relative cursor addressing,
     a screen-sized window must be fixed into the display for
     cursor addressing to work properly.  This is also used for
     the Tektronix 4025, where ttii sets the command character to
     be the one used by _t_e_r_m_c_a_p.

     Other capabilities include iiss, an initialization string for
     the terminal, and iiff, the name of a file containing long
     initialization strings.  These strings are expected to set
     the terminal into modes consistent with the rest of the
     _t_e_r_m_c_a_p description.  They are normally sent to the terminal
     by the _t_s_e_t program each time the user logs in.  They will
     be printed in the following order: iiss; setting tabs using cctt
     and sstt; and finally iiff.  (_T_e_r_m_i_n_f_o uses ii11--ii22 instead of iiss
     and runs the program iiPP and prints ii33 after the other ini-
     tializations.) A pair of sequences that does a harder reset
     from a totally unknown state can be analogously given as rrss
     and iiff.  These strings are output by the _r_e_s_e_t program,
     which is used when the terminal gets into a wedged state.
     (_T_e_r_m_i_n_f_o uses rr11--rr33 instead of rrss.) Commands are normally
     placed in rrss and rrff only if they produce annoying effects on
     the screen and are not necessary when logging in.	For exam-
     ple, the command to set the VT100 into 80-column mode would
     normally be part of iiss, but it causes an annoying glitch of
     the screen and is not normally needed since the terminal is
     usually already in 80-column mode.

     If the terminal has hardware tabs, the command to advance to
     the next tab stop can be given as ttaa (usually ^^II).  A "back-
     tab" command which moves leftward to the previous tab stop
     can be given as bbtt.  By convention, if the terminal driver
     modes indicate that tab stops are being expanded by the com-
     puter rather than being sent to the terminal, programs
     should not use ttaa or bbtt even if they are present, since the
     user may not have the tab stops properly set.  If the termi-
     nal has hardware tabs that are initially set every _n posi-
     tions when the terminal is powered up, then the numeric
     parameter iitt is given, showing the number of positions
     between tab stops.  This is normally used by the _t_s_e_t com-
     mand to determine whether to set the driver mode for
     hardware tab expansion, and whether to set the tab stops.
     If the terminal has tab stops that can be saved in nonvola-
     tile memory, the _t_e_r_m_c_a_p description can assume that they
     are properly set.

     If there are commands to set and clear tab stops, they can
     be given as cctt (clear all tab stops) and sstt (set a tab stop
     in the current column of every row).  If a more complex
     sequence is needed to set the tabs than can be described by
     this, the sequence can be placed in iiss or iiff.

     DDeellaayyss

     Certain capabilities control padding in the terminal driver.
     These are primarily needed by hardcopy terminals and are
     used by the _t_s_e_t program to set terminal driver modes
     appropriately.  Delays embedded in the capabilities ccrr, ssff,
     llee, ffff, and ttaa will cause the appropriate delay bits to be
     set in the terminal driver.  If ppbb (padding baud rate) is
     given, these values can be ignored at baud rates below the
     value of ppbb.  For 4.2BSD _t_s_e_t, the delays are given as
     numeric capabilities ddCC, ddNN, ddBB, ddFF, and ddTT instead.

     MMiisscceellllaanneeoouuss

     If the terminal requires other than a NUL (zero) character
     as a pad, this can be given as ppcc.  Only the first character
     of the ppcc string is used.

     If the terminal has commands to save and restore the posi-
     tion of the cursor, give them as sscc and rrcc.

     If the terminal has an extra "status line" that is not nor-
     mally used by software, this fact can be indicated.  If the
     status line is viewed as an extra line below the bottom
     line, then the capability hhss should be given.  Special
     strings to go to a position in the status line and to return
     from the status line can be given as ttss and ffss.  (ffss must
     leave the cursor position in the same place that it was
     before ttss.  If necessary, the sscc and rrcc strings can be
     included in ttss and ffss to get this effect.) The capability ttss
     takes one parameter, which is the column number of the
     status line to which the cursor is to be moved.  If escape
     sequences and other special commands such as tab work while
     in the status line, the flag eess can be given.  A string that
     turns off the status line (or otherwise erases its contents)
     should be given as ddss.  The status line is normally assumed
     to be the same width as the rest of the screen, _i._e., ccoo.
     If the status line is a different width (possibly because
     the terminal does not allow an entire line to be loaded),
     then its width in columns can be indicated with the numeric
     parameter wwss.

     If the terminal can move up or down half a line, this can be
     indicated with hhuu (half-line up) and hhdd (half-line down).
     This is primarily useful for superscripts and subscripts on
     hardcopy terminals.  If a hardcopy terminal can eject to the
     next page (form feed), give this as ffff (usually ^^LL).

     If there is a command to repeat a given character a given
     number of times (to save time transmitting a large number of
     identical characters), this can be indicated with the
     parameterized string rrpp.  The first parameter is the



Printed 7/9/88		 1 November 1985		       16






TERMCAP(5)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	       TERMCAP(5)



     character to be repeated and the second is the number of
     times to repeat it.  (This is a _t_e_r_m_i_n_f_o feature that is
     unlikely to be supported by a program that uses _t_e_r_m_c_a_p.)

     If the terminal has a settable command character, such as
     the Tektronix 4025, this can be indicated with CCCC.  A proto-
     type command character is chosen which is used in all capa-
     bilities.	This character is given in the CCCC capability to
     identify it.  The following convention is supported on some
     UNIX systems: The environment is to be searched for a CCCC
     variable, and if found, all occurrences of the prototype
     character are replaced by the character in the environment
     variable.	This use of the CCCC environment variable is a very
     bad idea, as it conflicts with _m_a_k_e(1).

     Terminal descriptions that do not represent a specific kind
     of known terminal, such as _s_w_i_t_c_h, _d_i_a_l_u_p, _p_a_t_c_h, and _n_e_t_-
     _w_o_r_k, should include the ggnn (generic) capability so that
     programs can complain that they do not know how to talk to
     the terminal.  (This capability does not apply to _v_i_r_t_u_a_l
     terminal descriptions for which the escape sequences are
     known.)

     If the terminal uses xoff/xon (DC3/DC1) handshaking for flow
     control, give xxoo.	Padding information should still be
     included so that routines can make better decisions about
     costs, but actual pad characters will not be transmitted.

     If the terminal has a "meta key" which acts as a shift key,
     setting the 8th bit of any character transmitted, then this
     fact can be indicated with kkmm.  Otherwise, software will
     assume that the 8th bit is parity and it will usually be
     cleared.  If strings exist to turn this "meta mode" on and
     off, they can be given as mmmm and mmoo.

     If the terminal has more lines of memory than will fit on
     the screen at once, the number of lines of memory can be
     indicated with llmm.  An explicit value of 0 indicates that
     the number of lines is not fixed, but that there is still
     more memory than fits on the screen.

     If the terminal is one of those supported by the UNIX system
     virtual terminal protocol, the terminal number can be given
     as vvtt.

     Media copy strings which control an auxiliary printer con-
     nected to the terminal can be given as ppss: print the con-
     tents of the screen; ppff: turn off the printer; and ppoo: turn
     on the printer.  When the printer is on, all text sent to
     the terminal will be sent to the printer.	It is undefined
     whether the text is also displayed on the terminal screen
     when the printer is on.  A variation ppOO takes one parameter



Printed 7/9/88		 1 November 1985		       17






TERMCAP(5)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	       TERMCAP(5)



     and leaves the printer on for as many characters as the
     value of the parameter, then turns the printer off.  The
     parameter should not exceed 255.  All text, including ppff, is
     transparently passed to the printer while ppOO is in effect.

     Strings to program function keys can be given as ppkk, ppll, and
     ppxx.  Each of these strings takes two parameters: the func-
     tion key number to program (from 0 to 9) and the string to
     program it with.  Function key numbers out of this range may
     program undefined keys in a terminal-dependent manner.  The
     differences among the capabilities are that ppkk causes press-
     ing the given key to be the same as the user typing the
     given string; ppll causes the string to be executed by the
     terminal in local mode; and ppxx causes the string to be
     transmitted to the computer.  Unfortunately, due to lack of
     a definition for string parameters in _t_e_r_m_c_a_p, only _t_e_r_m_i_n_f_o
     supports these capabilities.

     Hazeltine terminals, which do not allow `~' characters to be
     displayed, should indicate hhzz.

     The nncc capability, now obsolete, formerly indicated
     Datamedia terminals, which echo \\rr \\nn for carriage return
     then ignore a following linefeed.

     Terminals that ignore a linefeed immediately after an aamm
     wrap, such as the Concept, should indicate xxnn.

     If ccee is required to get rid of standout (instead of merely
     writing normal text on top of it), xxss should be given.

     Teleray terminals, where tabs turn all characters moved over
     to blanks, should indicate xxtt (destructive tabs).	This
     glitch is also taken to mean that it is not possible to
     position the cursor on top of a "magic cookie", and that to
     erase standout mode it is necessary to use delete and insert
     line.

     The Beehive Superbee, which is unable to correctly transmit
     the ESC or ^C characters, has xxbb, indicating that the "f1"
     key is used for ESC and "f2" for ^C.  (Only certain Super-
     bees have this problem, depending on the ROM.)

     Other specific terminal problems may be corrected by adding
     more capabilities of the form xx_x..

     If there are two very similar terminals, one can be defined

     string capability ttcc can be given with the name of the simi-
     lar terminal.  This capability must be _l_a_s_t, and the com-
     bined length of the entries must not exceed 1024.	The capa-
     bilities given before ttcc override those in the terminal type
     invoked by ttcc.  A capability can be canceled by placing xxxx@@
     to the left of the ttcc invocation, where _x_x is the capabil-
     ity.  For example, the entry

	  hn|2621-nl:ks@:ke@:tc=2621:

     defines a "2621-nl" that does not have the kkss or kkee capabil-
     ities, hence does not turn on the function key labels when
     in visual mode.  This is useful for different modes for a
     terminal, or for different user preferences.

     capabilities flagged as "obsolete" are avoided.

     Lines and columns are now stored by the kernel as well as in

     mation primarily; the information in this file is used only
     if the kernel does not have any information.

     _V_i allows only 256 characters for string capabilities, and
