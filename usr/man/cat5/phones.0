     phones - remote host phone number data base

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The file /etc/phones contains the system-wide private phone
     numbers for the _t_i_p(1C) program.  This file is normally
     unreadable, and so may contain privileged information.  The
     format of the file is a series of lines of the form:
     <system-name>[ \t]*<phone-number>.  The system name is one
     of those defined in the _r_e_m_o_t_e(5) file and the phone number
     is constructed from any sequence of characters terminated
     only by ``,'' or the end of the line.  The ``='' and ``*''
     characters are indicators to the auto call units to pause
     and wait for a second dial tone (when going through an
     exchange).  The ``='' is required by the DF02-AC and the
     ``*'' is required by the BIZCOMP 1030.

     Only one phone number per line is permitted.  However, if
     more than one line in the file contains the same system name
     _t_i_p(1C) will attempt to dial each one in turn, until it
     establishes a connection.
