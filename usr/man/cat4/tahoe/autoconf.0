     autoconf - diagnostics from autoconfiguration code

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     When UNIX bootstraps it probes the innards of the machine it
     is running on and locates controllers, drives, and other
     devices, printing out what it finds on the console.  This
     procedure is driven by a system configuration table which is
     processed by _c_o_n_f_i_g(8) and compiled into each kernel.

     VERSAbus devices are located by probing to see if their
     control-status registers respond.	If not, they are silently
     ignored.  If the control status register responds but the
     device cannot be made to interrupt, a diagnostic warning
     will be printed on the console and the device will not be
     available to the system.

     A generic system may be built which picks its root device at
     boot time as the ``best'' available device.  If such a sys-
     tem is booted with the RB_ASKNAME option of (see
     _r_e_b_o_o_t(2v)), then the name of the root device is read from
     the console terminal at boot time, and any available device
     may be used.

     ``dk0'', for tape formatters like ``yc1''.  The drive number
     comes from the unit plug on the drive or in the tape for-
     matter (nnoott on the tape drive; see below).

     is the name for the formatter.  A tape slave was found on
     the tape formatter at the indicated drive number (on the
     front of the tape drive).	UNIX will call the device, e.g.,
     ccyy00.

     interrupt, likely because it is broken, hung, or not the
     kind of device it is advertised to be.  The csr address is
     interpreted as described above.

     the name of the controller.

BBUUGGSS
     Very few devices actually figure out their interrupt vector
     by forcing the device to interrupt.  Only the upper megabyte
     of the VERSAbus address space is mapped into the system's
     virtual address space.
