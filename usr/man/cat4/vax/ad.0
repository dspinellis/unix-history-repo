     _A_d provides the interface to the Data Translation A/D con-
     verter.  This is nnoott a real-time driver, but merely allows
     the user process to sample the board's channels one at a
     time.  Each minor device selects a different A/D board.

     The driver communicates to a user process by means of
     ioctls.  The AD_CHAN ioctl selects which channel of the
     board to read.  For example,
	  chan = 5; ioctl(fd, AD_CHAN, &chan);
     selects channel 5.  The AD_READ ioctl actually reads the
     data and returns it to the user process.  An example is
	  ioctl(fd, AD_READ, &data);
