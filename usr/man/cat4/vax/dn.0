     The _d_n device provides an interface through a DEC DN-11 (or
     equivalent such as the Able Quadracall) to an auto-call unit
     (ACU).  To place an outgoing call one forks a sub-process
     which opens the appropriate call unit file, /_d_e_v/_c_u_a? and
     writes the phone number on it.  The parent process then
     opens the corresponding modem line /_d_e_v/_c_u_l?.  When the con-
     nection has been established, the open on the modem line,
     /_d_e_v/_c_u_l? will return and the process will be connected.  A
     timer is normally used to timeout the opening of the modem
     line.

     The codes for the phone numbers are:

     0-9    dial 0-9
     *	    dial * (`:' is a synonym)
     #	    dial # (`;' is a synonym)
     -	    delay 20 milliseconds
     <	    end-of-number (`e' is a synonym)
     =	    delay for a second dial tone (`w' is a synonym)
     f	    force a hangup of any existing connection

     The entire telephone number must be presented in a single
     _w_r_i_t_e system call.

     By convention, even numbered call units are for 300 baud
     modem lines, while odd numbered units are for 1200 baud
     lines.  For example, /_d_e_v/_c_u_a_0 is associated with a 300 baud
     modem line, /_d_e_v/_c_u_l_0, while /_d_e_v/_c_u_a_1 is associated with a
     1200 baud modem line, /_d_e_v/_c_u_l_1.  For devices such as the
     Quadracall which simulate multiple DN-11 units, the minor
     device indicates which outgoing modem to use.
