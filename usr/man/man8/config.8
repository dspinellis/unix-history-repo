.SH NAME
config \- Build system configuration files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/config
.I config_file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Config
builds a set of system configuration files from a short file which describes
the sort of system that is being configured.  It also takes as input a file
which tells
.I config
what files are needed to generate a system.
.PP
.I Config
should be run from the
.B conf
subdirectory of the system source (usually /sys/conf
or /usr/src/sys/conf).
.I Config
assumes that there is already a directory
.I "../config_file"
created and it places all its output files in there.  
The output of
.I config
consists of a number files:
.B ioconf.c
which contains a description
of what i/o devices are attached to the system, 
.B ubglue.s
which is a set of interrupt service routines for devices
attached to the UNIBUS,
.B makefile
for building the system and a set of header files which contain
the number of various devices that will be compiled into the system.
.PP
After running
.I config,
it is necessary to run "make depend" in the directory where the new makefile
was created.
.I Config
reminds you of this when it completes.
.PP
If you get any other error messages from
.I config,
you should fix the problems in your configuration file and try again.
If you try to compile a system that had configuration errors, you will
meet with failure.
.SH "CONFIG FILE FORMAT"
.PP
In the following descriptions, a number can be a decimal integer,
a whole octal number or a whole hexadecimal number.  Hex and octal
are specified to
.I config
in the same way they are specified to the C
compiler, a number starting with "0x" is a hex number and a number
starting with just a "0" is an octal number.  When specifying the
timezone, you may also use floating point numbers.
.PP
Comments are specified in a config file with the character "#".
All characters from a "#" to the end of a line are ignored.
.PP
Lines beginning with tabs are considered continuations of the previous
line.
.PP
Lines of the config file can be one of several types.  First there are
lines which describe general things about your system.  Here is a list
of the possibilities.
.HP 5
\fBcpu\fR\fI\ "type"\fR
.br
This system is to run on the cpu type specified.
More than one cpu type can appear in the config file.
Legal types are
.B VAX780, VAX750,
and
.B VAX7ZZ.
.HP 5
.BI options " optlist"
.br
Compile the listed options into the system.  Options in this list are
seperated by commas.
There is a list of options that you may specify in the generic makefile.
A line of the form "options FUNNY,HAHA" yields \-DFUNNY \-DHAHA to the
C compiler.
.HP 5
.BI timezone " number"
[
.B dst
]
.br
Specifies the timezone you are in.  This is measured in the number of hours
west of GMT you are.  5 is EST, 8 is PST.  If you specify
.B dst,
the system will operate under daylight savings time.
.HP 5
.BI ident " name"
.br
This system is to be known as
.I name.
This is usually a cute name like ERNIE (short for Ernie Co-Vax) or
VAXWELL (for Vaxwell Smart).
.HP 5
.BI maxusers " number"
.br
The maximum expected number of simultaneously active user on this system is
.I number.
This number is used to size several system data structures.
.HP 5
.BI config " device sysname"
.br
Generate a system which runs with its root on
.I device
and call it
.I sysname.
There may be more than one
.I config
specification in a config file.
.PP
The second type of line in the config file describes what devices your
system has and what they are connected to (e.g. I have a DZ-11 on UNIBUS
Adapter 0).
These lines have the following format.
.br
.I "	dev_type	dev_name	"
.B at
.I "con_dev more_info"
.PP
.I Dev_type
is either
.B master,
.B tape,
.B disk,
.B controller
.B device,
or
.B pseudo-device.
A master is a MASSBUS tape controller.
A controller is a disk controller, a UNIBUS tape controller,
an mba (MASSBUS) or a uba (UNIBUS).  A device is usually something which
connects to the uba, like a DZ-11 or a DR-11.
Disk and tape should be self-explanatory.
A pseudo-device is something
which should be conditionally loaded, but is not really a device.
Current examples are the
bk line discipline, the pseudo-tty driver and various network
subsystems.  If you load a subsystem
you will probably find it convenient to enable
conditionaly code using a
.B options
specification.
.PP
The
.I dev_name
is the name of the device you are specifying.  If it is not a pseudo-device,
you must give a number afterwards (e.g. dz0, dz1, hp0).
.PP
.I Con_dev
is what the device you are specifying is connected to.  If you have a disk
on MASSBUS adapter zero then the proper
.I con_dev
is
.B mba0.
For MASSBUS and UNIBUS adapters, you must give
.B nexus?
as the
.I con_dev.
.PP
The
.I more_info
field is a sequence of the following:
.HP 5
.BI csr " addr"
.br
Specifies the csr for a device.  Must be given for UNIBUS tape and disk
controllers and all devices connected to the UNIBUS.  Make certain that
you put a leading zero on the address so that it will be interpreted
as an octal number.
.HP 5
.BI drive " number"
.br
For a disk or UNIBUS tape, specifies which drive this is.
.HP 5
.BI slave " number"
.br
For a MASSBUS tape, specifies which tape slave it is.
.HP 5
.BI flags " number"
.br
These flags are passed to the device driver at system initialization time.
.HP 5
.BI vector " addr [ addr ]"
.br
For devices which interrupt on the UNIBUS, specifies the interrupt
service routine.
.PP
The easiest way to understand config files it to look at a working
one and modify it to suit your system.  Here is a short sample configuration
file for a system with an RM03, a TU45, a DZ-11 and a DH-11.

.fi
.dt
.PP
A
.B ?
may be substituted for a number in two places and the system will
figure out what to fill in for the
.B ?
when it boots.  You can put question marks on a
.I con_dev
(e.g. at mba?) or on a drive number (e.g. drive ?).
This allows redundancy as a single system can be built
which will reboot on different hardware configurations.

.SH BUGS
The line numbers reported in error messages are usually off by one.
.PP
Should describe the format of the ``files'' file here; you can
probably figure it out for yourself in the meantime.
.PP
No exhaustive testing of responses to all the weird input semantic errors
possible has been done.
