DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The _I _C_h_i_n_g or _B_o_o_k _o_f _C_h_a_n_g_e_s is an ancient Chinese oracle
     that has been in use for centuries as a source of wisdom and
     advice.

     The text of the _o_r_a_c_l_e (as it is sometimes known) consists
     of sixty-four _h_e_x_a_g_r_a_m_s, each symbolized by a particular
     arrangement of six straight (---) and broken (- -) lines.
     These lines have values ranging from six through nine, with
     the even values indicating the broken lines.

     Each hexagram consists of two major sections.  The JJuuddggeemmeenntt
     relates specifically to the matter at hand (E.g., "It furth-
     ers one to have somewhere to go.") while the IImmaaggee describes
     the general attributes of the hexagram and how they apply to
     one's own life ("Thus the superior man makes himself strong
     and untiring.").

     When any of the lines have the values six or nine, they are
     moving lines; for each there is an appended judgement which
     becomes significant.  Furthermore, the moving lines are
     inherently unstable and change into their opposites; a
     second hexagram (and thus an additional judgement) is
     formed.

     Normally, one consults the oracle by fixing the desired
     question firmly in mind and then casting a set of changes
     (lines) using yarrow-stalks or tossed coins.  The resulting
     hexagram will be the answer to the question.

     Using an algorithm suggested by S. C. Johnson, the UNIX _o_r_a_-
     _c_l_e simply reads a question from the standard input (up to
     an EOF) and hashes the individual characters in combination
     with the time of day, process id and any other magic numbers
     which happen to be lying around the system.  The resulting
     value is used as the seed of a random number generator which
     drives a simulated coin-toss divination.  The answer is then
     piped through nnrrooffff for formatting and will appear on the
     standard output.

     For those who wish to remain steadfast in the old tradi-
     tions, the oracle will also accept the results of a personal
     divination using, for example, coins.  To do this, cast the
     change and then type the resulting line values as an argu-
     ment.

     The impatient modern may prefer to settle for Chinese cook-
     ies; try _f_o_r_t_u_n_e(6).
