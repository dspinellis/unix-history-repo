     _M_o_n_o_p is reminiscent of the Parker Brother's game Monopoly,
     and monitors a game between 1 to 9 users.	It is assumed
     that the rules of Monopoly are known.  The game follows the
     standard rules, with the exception that, if a property goes
     up for auction and there are only two solvent players, no
     auction is held and the property remains unowned.

     The game, in effect, lends the player money, so it is possi-
     ble to buy something which you cannot afford.  However, as
     soon as a person goes into debt, he must "fix the problem",
     _i._e., make himself solvent, before play can continue.  If
     this is not possible, the player's property reverts to his
     debtee, either a player or the bank.  A player can resign at
     any time to any person or the bank, which puts the property
     back on the board, unowned.

     Any time that the response to a question is a _s_t_r_i_n_g, e.g.,
     a name, place or person, you can type `?' to get a list of
     valid answers.  It is not possible to input a negative
     number, nor is it ever necessary.

     _A _S_u_m_m_a_r_y _o_f _C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s:
     _q_u_i_t:     quit game: This allows you to quit the game.  It
	       asks you if you're sure.
     _p_r_i_n_t:    print board: This prints out the current board.
	       The columns have the following meanings (column
	       headings are the same for the wwhheerree, oowwnn hhoollddiinnggss,
	       and hhoollddiinnggss commands):
	       Name  The first ten characters of the name of the
		     square
	       Own   The _n_u_m_b_e_r of the owner of the property.
	       Price The cost of the property (if any)
	       Mg    This field has a `*' in it if the property
		     is mortgaged
	       #     If the property is a Utility or Railroad,
		     this is the number of such owned by the
		     owner.  If the property is land, this is the
		     number of houses on it.
	       Rent  Current rent on the property.  If it is not
		     owned, there is no rent.
     _w_h_e_r_e:    where players are: Tells you where all the players
	       are.  A `*' indicates the current player.
     _o_w_n _h_o_l_d_i_n_g_s:
	       List your own holdings, _i._e., money, get-out-of-
	       jail-free cards, and property.

     _h_o_l_d_i_n_g_s: holdings list: Look at anyone's holdings.  It will
	       ask you whose holdings you wish to look at.  When
	       you are finished, type "done".
     _s_h_e_l_l:    shell escape: Escape to a shell.  When the shell
	       dies, the program continues where you left off.
     _m_o_r_t_g_a_g_e: mortgage property: Sets up a list of mortgageable
	       property, and asks which you wish to mortgage.
     _u_n_m_o_r_t_g_a_g_e:
	       unmortgage property: Unmortgage mortgaged pro-
	       perty.
     _b_u_y:      buy houses: Sets up a list of monopolies on which
	       you can buy houses.  If there is more than one, it
	       asks you which you want to buy for.  It then asks
	       you how many for each piece of property, giving
	       the current amount in parentheses after the pro-
	       perty name.  If you build in an unbalanced manner
	       (a disparity of more than one house within the
	       same monopoly), it asks you to re-input things.
     _s_e_l_l:     sell houses: Sets up a list of monopolies from
	       which you can sell houses.  It operates in an
	       analogous manner to _b_u_y.
     _c_a_r_d:     card for jail: Use a get-out-of-jail-free card to
	       get out of jail.  If you're not in jail, or you
	       don't have one, it tells you so.
     _p_a_y:      pay for jail: Pay $50 to get out of jail, from
	       whence you are put on Just Visiting.  Difficult to
	       do if you're not there.
     _t_r_a_d_e:    This allows you to trade with another player.  It
	       asks you whom you wish to trade with, and then
	       asks you what each wishes to give up.  You can get
	       a summary at the end, and, in all cases, it asks
	       for confirmation of the trade before doing it.
     _r_e_s_i_g_n:   Resign to another player or the bank.  If you
	       resign to the bank, all property reverts to its
	       virgin state, and get-out-of-jail free cards
	       revert to the deck.
     _s_a_v_e:     save game: Save the current game in a file for
	       later play.  You can continue play after saving,
	       either by adding the file in which you saved the
	       game after the _m_o_n_o_p command, or by using the
	       _r_e_s_t_o_r_e command (see below).  It will ask you
	       which file you wish to save it in, and, if the
	       file exists, confirm that you wish to overwrite
	       it.
     _r_e_s_t_o_r_e:  restore game: Read in a previously saved game from
	       a file.	It leaves the file intact.
     _r_o_l_l:     Roll the dice and move forward to your new loca-
	       tion. If you simply hit the <RETURN> key instead
	       of a command, it is the same as typing _r_o_l_l.
