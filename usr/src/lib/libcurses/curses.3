.SH NAME
curses \- screen functions with ``optimal'' cursor motion
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cc
[ flags ] files
.B \-lcurses \-ltermcap
[ libraries ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
These routines give the user a method
of updating screens with reasonable optimization.
They keep an image of the current screen,
and the user sets up an image of a new one.
Then the
.I refresh()
tells the routines to make the current screen look
like the new one.
In order to initialize the routines,
the routine
.I initscr()
must be called before any of the other routines
that deal with windows and screens
are used.
The routine
.I endwin()
should be called before exiting.
