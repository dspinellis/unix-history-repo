.Ds
.Fd delwin win
WINDOW	*win;
.De
Deletes the window from existence.
All resources are freed for future use by
.b calloc (3).
If a window has a
.Fn subwin
allocated window inside of it,
deleting the outer window
the subwindow is not affected,
even though this does invalidate it.
Therefore,
subwindows should be deleted before their
outer windows are.
.Ds
.Fd endwin
.De
Finish up window routines before exit.
This restores the terminal to the state it was before
.Fn initscr
(or
.Fn gettmode
and
.Fn setterm )
was called.
It should always be called before exiting.
It does not exit.
This is especially useful for resetting tty stats
when trapping rubouts via
.b signal (2).
.Ds
.Fd getyx win\*,y\*,x \*m
WINDOW	*win;
int	y\*,x;
.De
Puts the current \*y of
.Vn win
in the variables
.Vn y
and
.Vn x .
Since it is a macro,
not a function,
you do not pass the address
of
.Vn y
and
.Vn x .
.Ds
.Fd inch "" \*m
.sp .5
.Fd winch win \*m
WINDOW	*win;
.De
Returns the character at the current \*(y
on the given window.
This does not make any changes to the window.
\*(Nm
.Ds
.Fd initscr
.De
Initialize the screen routines.
This must be called before any of the screen routines are used.
It initializes the terminal-type data and such,
and without it, none of the routines can operate.
If standard input is not a tty,
it sets the specifications to the terminal
whose name is pointed to by
.Vn Def\*_term
(initialy "dumb").
If the boolean
.Vn My\*_term
is true,
.Vn Def\*_term
is always used.
.Ds
.Fd leaveok win\*,boolf \*m
WINDOW	*win;
bool	boolf;
.De
Sets the boolean flag for leaving the cursor after the last change.
If
.Vn boolf
is TRUE,
the cursor will be left after the last update on the terminal,
and the current \*y for
.Vn win
will be changed accordingly.
If it is FALSE,
it will be moved to the current \*y.
This flag
(initialy FALSE)
retains its value until changed by the user.
.Ds
.Fd longname termbuf\*,name
char	*termbuf\*,*name;
.De
Fills in
.Vn name
with the long (full) name of the terminal described by the termcap entry in
.Vn termbuf .
It is generally of little use,
but is nice for telling the user in a readable format what terminal
we think he has.
This is available in the global variable
.Vn ttytype .
.Vn Termbuf
is usually set via the termlib routine
.Fn tgetent .
.Ds
.Fd mvwin win\*,y\*,x
WINDOW	*win;
int	y, x;
.De
Move the home position of the window
.Vn win
from its current starting coordinates
to
.Vn y\*,x ). (
If that would put part or all of the window
off the edge of the terminal screen,
.Fn mvwin
returns ERR and does not change anything.
.Ds
.Fd newwin lines\*,cols\*,begin\*_y\*,begin\*_x "" "WINDOW *"
int	lines\*,cols\*,begin\*_y\*,begin\*_x;
.De
Create a new window with
.Vn lines
lines and
.Vn cols
columns starting at position
.Vn begin\*_y\*,begin\*_x ). (
If either
.Vn lines
or
.Vn cols
is 0 (zero),
that dimension will be set to
.Vn "LINES \- begin\*_y" ) (
or
.Vn "COLS \- begin\*_x" ) (
respectively.
Thus, to get a new window of dimensions
.Vn LINES
\(mu
.Vn COLS ,
use
.Fn newwin . "" 0\*,0\*,0\*,0
.Ds
.Fd nl "" \*m
.sp .5
.Fd nonl "" \*m
.De
Set or unset the terminal to/from nl mode,
i.e., start/stop the system from mapping
.b <RETURN>
to
.b <LINE-FEED> .
If the mapping is not done,
.Fn refresh
can do more optimization,
so it is recommended, but not required, to turn it off.
.Ds
.Fd scrollok win\*,boolf \*m
WINDOW	*win;
bool	boolf;
.De
Set the scroll flag for the given window.
If
.Vn boolf
is FALSE, scrolling is not allowed.
This is its default setting.
.Ds
.Fd touchwin win
WINDOW	*win;
.De
Make it appear that the every location on the window
has been changed.
This is usually only needed for refreshes with overlapping windows.
.Ds
.Fd subwin win\*,lines\*,cols\*,begin\*_y\*,begin\*_x "" "WINDOW *"
WINDOW	*win;
int	lines\*,cols\*,begin\*_y\*,begin\*_x;
.De
Create a new window with
.Vn lines
lines and
.Vn cols
columns starting at position
.Vn begin\*_y\*,begin\*_x ) (
in the middle of the window
.i win .
This means that any change made to either window
in the area covered
by the subwindow will be made on both windows.
.Vn begin\*_y\*,begin\*_x
are specified relative to the overall screen,
not the relative (0\*,0) of
.Vn win .
If either
.Vn lines
or
.Vn cols
is 0 (zero),
that dimension will be set to
.Vn "LINES \- begin\*_y" ) (
or
.Vn "COLS \- begin\*_x" ) (
respectively.
.Ds
.Fd unctrl ch \*m
char	ch;
.De
This is actually a debug function for the library,
but it is of general usefulness.
It returns a string which is a representation of
.Vn ch .
Control characters become their upper-case equivalents preceded by a "^".
Other letters stay just as they are.
To use
.Fn unctrl ,
you must have
.b #include\ <unctrl.h>
in your file.
