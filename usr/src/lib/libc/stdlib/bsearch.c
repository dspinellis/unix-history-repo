 * The code below is a bit sneaky.  After a comparison fails, we
 * divide the work in half by moving either left or right. If lim
 * is odd, moving left simply involves halving lim: e.g., when lim
 * is 5 we look at item 2, so we change lim to 2 so that we will
 * look at items 0 & 1.  If lim is even, the same applies.  If lim
 * is odd, moving right again involes halving lim, this time moving
 * the base up one item past p: e.g., when lim is 5 we change base
 * to item 3 and make lim 2 so that we will look at items 3 and 4.
 * If lim is even, however, we have to shrink it by one before
 * halving: e.g., when lim is 4, we still looked at item 2, so we
 * have to make lim 3, then halve, obtaining 1, so that we will only
 * look at item 3.
