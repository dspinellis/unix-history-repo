.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sysctl
.Nd get or set kernel state
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/sysctl.h>
.Ft int
.Fn sysctl "int *name" "u_int namelen" "void *old" "u_int *oldlenp" "void *new" "u_int newlen"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn sysctl
function retrieves kernel state and allows processes with
appropriate privilege to set kernel state.
The state to be set is described using a ``MIB'' style name,
described in a
.Fa namelen
length array of integers pointed to by
.Fa name .
The top level names are defined with a CTL_ prefix in
.Pa <sys/sysctl.h> .
The next levels down are found in the files given in the ``FILES''
section of this manual page.
.Pp
To retrieve a value,
.Fa old
is set to point to a buffer
into which the requested value is to be placed.
The length of the buffer is given in the location pointed to by
.Fa oldlenp .
The size of the returned value is put in the location pointed to by
.Fa oldlenp .
The size of the requested value can be determined by calling 
.Fn sysctl
with a NULL parameter for
.Fa old ;
the size of the value will be returned in the location pointed to by
.Fa oldlenp .
If the old value is not desired,
.Fa old
and
.Fa oldlenp
can be set to NULL.
.Pp
To set a new value,
.Fa new
is set to point to a buffer of length
.Fa newlen
from which the requested value is to be taken.
If the setting of a new value is not desired,
.Fa new
should be set to NULL and
.Fa newlen
set to 0.
.Pp
For example, to retrieve the maximum number of processes allowed
in the system, one would use the follow request:
.sp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
int name[2], len, maxproc;

name[0] = CTL_KERN;
name[1] = KERN_MAXPROC;
len = sizeof maxproc;
sysctl(name, 2, &maxproc, &len, NULL, 0);
.Ed
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the call to
.Fn sysctl
is successful, the length of the old value is returned.
Otherwise \-1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set appropriately.
.Sh ERRORS
The following error may be reported:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The buffer
.Fa name ,
.Fa old ,
.Fa new ,
or length pointer
.Fa oldlenp
contains an invalid address.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa name
array is less than two or greater than CTL_MAXNAME.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
A non-null
.Fa new
is given and its specified length in
.Fa newlen
is too large or too small.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
The length pointed to by
.Fa oldlenp
is too short to hold the requested value.
.It Bq Er ENOTDIR
The
.Fa name
array specifies an intermediate rather than terminal name.
.It Bq Er EOPNOTSUPP
The
.Fa name
array specifies a value that is unknown.
.It Bq Er EPERM
An attempt is made to set a read-only value.
.It Bq Er EPERM
A process without appropriate privilege attempts to set a value.
