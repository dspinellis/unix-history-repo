.SH NAME
getloadavg \- get system load averages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B getloadavg(loadavg, nelem)
.B double loadavg[nelem];
.B int nelem;
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Getloadavg
returns the number of processes in the system run queue
averaged over various periods of time.  Up to
.I nelem
samples are retrieved and assigned to successive elements of
.I loadavg[].
The system imposes a maximum of 3 samples, representing averages
over the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes, respectively.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
uptime(1), nlist(3), kmem(4)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
If the load average was unobtainable, \-1 is returned; otherwise,
the number of samples actually retrieved is returned.
.SH BUGS
Programs using this utility must have read permission on
.I /dev/kmem.
This restriction will eventually be lifted.
