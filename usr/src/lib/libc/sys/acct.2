.SH NAME
acct \- turn accounting on or off
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B acct(file)
.B char *file;
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The system is prepared to write a record
in an accounting
.I file
for each process as it terminates.
This
call, with a null-terminated string naming an existing file
as argument, turns on accounting;
records for each terminating process are appended to
.IR file .
An argument of 0 causes accounting to be turned off.
.PP
The accounting file format is given in
.IR acct (5).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
acct(5), sa(8)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
On error \-1 is returned.
The file must exist and the call may be exercised only by the super-user.
It is erroneous to try to turn on accounting when it is already on.
.SH BUGS
No accounting is produced for programs running
when a crash occurs.
In particular nonterminating programs are never
accounted for.
