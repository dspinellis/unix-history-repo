(including directory and special file bits)
is initialized from

is modified by the process's mode mask; see

The first block pointer of the i-node
is initialized from
.IR addr .
For ordinary files and directories
.I addr
is normally zero.
In the case of a special file,
.I addr
specifies which special file.
.PP
.I Mknod
may be invoked only by the super-user.
