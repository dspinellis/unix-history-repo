.SH NAME
unlink \- remove directory entry
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
unlink(path)
char *path;
.fi
.ft R
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Unlink
removes the entry for the file
.I path
from its directory.
If this entry was the last link to the file,
and no process has the file open, then
all resources associated with the file are reclaimed.
If, however, the file was open in any process, the actual
resource reclamation is delayed until it is closed,
even though the directory entry has disappeared.
.SH "RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
