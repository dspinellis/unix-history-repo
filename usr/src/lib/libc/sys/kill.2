.SH NAME
kill \- send signal to a process
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B kill(pid, sig)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Kill
sends the signal
.I sig
to the process specified by the
process number
.I pid.
See
.IR sigsys (2)
for a list of signals.
.PP
The sending and receiving processes must
have the same effective user ID, otherwise
this call is restricted to the super-user.
(A single exception is the signal SIGCONT which may be sent
as described in
.IR killpg (2),
although it is usually sent using
.I killpg
rather than
.IR kill ).
.PP
If the process number is 0,
the signal is sent to all other processes in the
sender's process group;
see
.IR tty (4)
and also
.IR killpg (2).
.PP
If the process number is \-1, and the user is the super-user,
the signal is broadcast universally
except to processes 0, 1, 2, the scheduler
initialization, and pageout processes,
and the process sending the signal.
.PP
Processes may send signals to themselves.
.SH "SEE ALSO"

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Zero is returned if the process is killed;
\-1 is returned if the process does not
have the same effective user ID and the
user is not super-user, or if the process
does not exist.
