New this time:  improvements to the manual pages, and an important
extension, the REG_STARTEND option to regexec().

installation notes:
--------
Limits.h, stdlib.h are fakes for ANSI headers not present on my system;
delete them if you've got real ones.

Memmove.c is a fake for an ANSI subroutine I don't have.

Split.c is used for regression testing but is not part of the RE routines
themselves.

Just "make" will build regcomp.o, regexec.o, regfree.o, and regerror.o
(the actual routines), bundle them together into a test program, and run
a regression test on them.  No output is good output.

Regex.h is for /usr/include.  All other .h files are internal only.

For an ANSI compiler, you want to uncomment the prototype parameters in
the function declarations in regex.h.

If you have an ANSI compiler, take -Dconst= out of Makefile's CFLAGS.
Do not take -DPOSIX_MISTAKE out.  You probably want to put -DNDEBUG in,
to get rid of all the assertion tests, for building production versions
after you've run the regression test.  (The regression test won't quite
compile with -DNDEBUG at the moment.)
