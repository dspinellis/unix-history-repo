 *	C start up routine.
 *	Robert Henry, UCB, 20 Oct 81
 *
 *	We make the following (true) assumptions:
 *	1) when the kernel calls start, it does a jump to location 2,
 *	and thus avoids the register save mask.  We are NOT called
 *	with a calls!  see sys1.c:setregs().
 *	2) The only register variable that we can trust is sp,
 *	which points to the base of the kernel calling frame.
 *	Do NOT believe the documentation in exec(2) regarding the
 *	values of fp and ap.
 *	3) We can allocate as many register variables as we want,
 *	and don't have to save them for anybody.
 *	4) Because of the ways that asm's work, we can't have
 *	any automatic variables allocated on the stack, because
 *	we must catch the value of sp before any automatics are
 *	allocated.
