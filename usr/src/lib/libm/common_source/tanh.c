/* TANH(X)
 * RETURN THE HYPERBOLIC TANGENT OF X
 * DOUBLE PRECISION (VAX D FORMAT 56 BITS, IEEE DOUBLE 53 BITS)
 * CODED IN C BY K.C. NG, 1/8/85; 
 * REVISED BY K.C. NG on 2/8/85, 2/11/85, 3/7/85, 3/24/85.
 *
 * Required system supported functions :
 *	copysign(x,y)
 *	finite(x)
 *
 * Required kernel function:
 *	expm1(x)	...exp(x)-1
 *
 * Method :
 *	1. reduce x to non-negative by tanh(-x) = - tanh(x).
 *	2.
 *	    0      <  x <=  1.e-10 :  tanh(x) := x
 *					          -expm1(-2x)
 *	    1.e-10 <  x <=  1      :  tanh(x) := --------------
 *					         expm1(-2x) + 2
 *							  2
 *	    1      <= x <=  22.0   :  tanh(x) := 1 -  ---------------
 *						      expm1(2x) + 2
 *	    22.0   <  x <= INF     :  tanh(x) := 1.
 *
 *	Note: 22 was chosen so that fl(1.0+2/(expm1(2*22)+2)) == 1.
 *
 * Special cases:
 *	tanh(NaN) is NaN;
 *	only tanh(0)=0 is exact for finite argument.
 *
 * Accuracy:
 *	tanh(x) returns the exact hyperbolic tangent of x nealy rounded.
 *	In a test run with 1,024,000 random arguments on a VAX, the maximum
 *	observed error was 2.22 ulps (units in the last place).
