.Tn CS/80
disk interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "master hpib? at scode?"
.Cd "disk rd? at hpib? slave?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This is a generic
.Tn CS/80
disk driver.
Only a small number of possible
.Tn CS/80
drives are supported,
but others can easily be added by adding tables to the driver.
It is a typical block-device driver; see
.Xr physio 4 .
.Pp
The script
.Xr MAKEDEV 8
should be used to create the
.Nm rd
special files; consult
.Xr mknod 8
if a special file needs to be made manually.
.Sh DISK SUPPORT
The driver interrogates the controller
to determine the type of drive attached.
The driver recognizes the following drives:
7912, 7914, 7933, 7936, 7937, 7945,
.Tn 757A/B ,
.Tn 7958A/B ,
.Tn 7959B,
7962, 7963, 9122, 9134, 7912, 7936,
and 9122,
not all of which have been tested.
Special file names begin with
.Sq Li rd
and
.Sq Li rrd
for the block and character files respectively. The second
component of the name, a drive unit number in the range of zero to
seven, is represented by a
.Sq Li ?
in the disk layouts below. The last component of the name is the
file system partition
and is designated
by a letter from
.Sq Li a
to
.Sq Li h
which also corresponds to a minor device number sets: zero to seven,
eight to 15, 16 to 23 and so forth for drive zero, drive two and drive
three respectively
(see physio 4 ) .
The location and size (in sectors) of the

.El
.Pp
The eight partitions as given support four basic, non-overlapping layouts,
though not all partitions exist on all drive types.
.Pp
In the first layout there are three partitions and a ``bootblock'' area.
The bootblock area is at the beginning of the disk and holds
the standalone disk boot program.
The
.Pa rd?a
partition is for the root file system,
.Pa rd?b
is a paging/swapping area, and
.Pa rd?g
is for everything else.
.Pp
The second layout is the same idea,
but has a larger paging/swapping partition
.Pq Pa rd?d
and
a smaller ``everything else'' partition
.Pq Pa rd?h .
This layout is better for environments which run many large processes.
.Pp
The third layout is a variation of the second,
but breaks the
.Pa rd?h
partition into two partitions,
.Pa rd?e
and
.Pa rd?f .
.Pp
The final layout is intended for a large, single file system second disk.
It is also used when writing out the boot program since it is the only
partition mapping the bootblock area.

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "rd%d err: v%d u%d, R0x%x F0x%x A0x%x I0x%x, block %d"
An unrecoverable data error occurred during transfer of the
specified block on the specified disk.
.El
.Sh BUGS
The current disk partitioning is totally bogus.
.Tn CS/80
drives have 256 byte sectors which are mapped to 512 byte
``sectors'' by the driver.
Since some
.Tn CS/80
drives have an odd number of sectors per cylinder,
the disk geometry used is not always accurate.
.Pp
The partition tables for the file systems should be read off of each pack,
as they are never quite what any single installation would prefer,
and this would make packs more portable.
.Pp
A program to analyze the logged error information (even in its
present reduced form) is needed.
