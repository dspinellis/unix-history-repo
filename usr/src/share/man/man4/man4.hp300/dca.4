.Sh NAME
.Nm dca
.Nd
.Tn HP 98644A
communications interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device dca0 at scode9 flags 0x1"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Tn 98644A
is a single port
.Tn EIA
.Tn RS-232C
.Pf ( Tn CCITT
.Tn V.28 )
communications interface with a single character buffer.
Such an interface is built-in to all series 300 machines.
.Pp
Input and output for each line may set to one of following baud rates;
50, 75, 110, 134.5, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800, 9600 or
19200.
.Pp
An optional argument
.Ar flags
may be set to 1 if the line should be treated as hard-wired
with carrier always present or 0 if modem control is desired.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Pa
.It Pa /dev/tty0
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It dca%d: silo overflow.
The single-character input
.Dq silo
has overflowed and incoming data has been lost.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr tty 4
.Sh BUGS
Data loss is possible on busy systems with baud rates greater than 300.
The
.Nm dca
has never been tested with modem control enabled or on anything but the
built-in interface.
