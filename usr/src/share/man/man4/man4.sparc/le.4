.Sh NAME
.Nm le
.Nd SPARC AMD 7990 LANCE ethernet interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "le* at sbus? slot ? offset ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm
interface provides access to the 10 Mb/s Ethernet network via the
.Tn AMD
7990
.Tn LANCE
Ethernet chip set.
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the local
network.
