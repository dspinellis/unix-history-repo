.Sh NAME
.Nm qe
.Nd
.Tn DEC DEQNA
.Tn Q-bus
10 Mb/s Ethernet interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device qe0 at uba? csr 174440 vector qeintr"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm qe
interface provides access to a 10 Mb/s Ethernet network through
the
.Tn DEC DEQNA
.Tn Q-bus
controller.
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm qe
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to map dynamically  between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the local
network.
.Pp
The interface normally tries to use a
.Dq trailer
encapsulation
to minimize copying data on input and output.
The use of trailers is negotiated with
.Tn ARP .
This negotiation may be disabled, on a per-interface basis,
by setting the
.Dv IFF_NOTRAILERS
flag with an
.Dv SIOCSIFFLAGS
.Xr ioctl .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr netintro 4 ,
.Xr inet 4 ,
.Xr arp 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver appeared in
.Bx 4.3 .
