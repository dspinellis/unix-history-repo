.SH NAME
uda \- UDA50 disk controller interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "controller uda0 at uba0 csr 0172150 vector udaintr"
.br
.b "disk ra0 at uda0 drive 0"
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a driver for the DEC UDA50 disk controller and other
compatible controllers.  The UDA50 communicates with the host through
a packet protocol known as the Mass Storage Control Protocol (MSCP).
Consult the file
.RI < vax/mscp.h >
for a detailed description of this protocol.
.PP
Files with minor device numbers 0 through 7 refer to various portions
of drive 0; minor devices 8 through 15 refer to drive 1, etc.  The
standard device names begin with `ra' followed by the drive number
and then a letter a-h for partitions 0-7 respectively.
The character ? stands here for a drive number in the range 0-7.
.PP
The block files access the disk via the system's normal buffering
mechanism mechanism and may be read and written without regard to
physical disk records.  There is also a `raw' interface which provides
for direct transmission between the disk and the user's read or write
buffer.  A single read or write call results in exactly one I/O
operation and therefore raw I/O is considerably more efficient when
many words are transmitted.  The names of the raw files conventionally
begin with an extra `r'.
.PP
In raw I/O counts should be a multiple of 512 bytes (a disk sector).
Likewise
.I seek
calls should specify a multiple of 512 bytes.
.SH "DISK SUPPORT"
This driver configures the type of each drive when it is first
encountered.  A partition table in the driver is required for each type
of disk.  The origin and size (in sectors) of the pseudo-disks on each
drive are shown below.  Not all partitions begin on cylinder
boundaries, as on other drives, because previous drivers used one
partition table for all drive types.  Variants of the partition tables
are common; check the driver and the file
.IR /etc/disktab ( disktab (5))
for other possibilities.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP
panic: udaslave
No command packets were available while the driver was looking
for disk drives.  The controller is not extending enough credits
to use the drives.
.TP
uda%d: no response to Get Unit Status request
A disk drive was found, but did not respond to a status request.
This is either a hardware problem or someone pulling unit number
plugs very fast.
.TP
uda%d: unit %d off line
While searching for drives, the controller found one that
seems to be manually disabled.  It is ignored.
.TP
uda%d: unable to get unit status
Something went wrong while trying to determine the status of
a disk drive.  This is followed by an error detail.
.TP
uda%d: unit %d, next %d
This probably never happens, but I wanted to know if it did.  I
have no idea what one should do about it.
.TP
uda%d: cannot handle unit number %d (max is %d)
The controller found a drive whose unit number is too large.
Valid unit numbers are those in the range [0..7].
.TP
uda%d: unit %d (media ID `%s') is of unknown type %d; ignored
The controller found a drive whose type is not known, and thus has
no partitioning.  The drive has been ignored.  You can add the type
to the udatypes[] table, now that you know what it is:  The media
ID will be something like `DU RA25'.
.TP
uda%d: uballoc map failed
Unibus resource map allocation failed during initialisation.  This
can only happen if you have 496 devices on a Unibus.
.TP
uda%d: timeout during init
The controller did not initialise within ten seconds.  A hardware
problem, but it sometimes goes away if you try again.
.TP
uda%d: init failed, sa=%b
The controller refused to initalise.
.TP
uda%d: controller hung
The controller never finished initialisation.  Retrying may sometimes
fix it.
.TP
ra%d: drive will not come on line
The drive will not come on line, probably because it is spun down.
This should be preceded by a message giving details as to why the
drive stayed off line.
.TP
uda%d: still hung
When the controller hangs, the driver occasionally tries to reinitialise
it.  This means it just tried, without success.
.TP
panic: udastart: bp==NULL
A bug in the driver has put an empty drive queue on a controller queue.
.TP
uda%d: command ring too small
If you increase NCMDL2, you may see a performance improvement.
(See /sys/vaxuba/uda.c.)
.TP
panic: udastart
A drive was found marked for status or on-line functions while performing
status or on-line functions.  This indicates a bug in the driver.
.TP
uda%d: controller error, sa=%b
The controller reported an error.  The driver will reset it and retry
pending I/O.
.TP
uda%d: stray intr
The controller interrupted when it should have stayed quiet.  The
interrupt has been ignored.
.TP
uda%d: init step %d failed, sa=%b
The controller reported an error during the named initialisation step.
The driver will retry initialisation later.
.TP
uda%d: version %d model %d
An informational message giving the revision level of the controller.
.TP
uda%d: DMA burst size set to %d
An informational message showing the DMA burst size, in words.
.TP
panic: udaintr
Indicates a bug in the generic MSCP code.
.TP
uda%d: driver bug, state %d
The driver has a bogus value for the controller state.  Something
is quite wrong.  This is immediately followed by a `panic: udastate'.
.TP
uda%d: purge bdp %d
A benign message tracing BDP purges.  I have been trying to figure
out what BDP purges are for.  You might want to comment out this
call to log() in /sys/vaxuba/uda.c.
.TP
.RI "uda%d: SETCTLRC failed: " detail
The Set Controller Characteristics command (the last part of the
controller initialisation sequence) failed.  The
.I detail
message tells why.
.TP
.RI "uda%d: attempt to bring ra%d on line failed: " detail
The drive could not be brought on line.  The
.I detail
message tells why.
.TP
uda%d: ra%d: unknown type %d
The type index of the named drive is not known to the driver, so the
drive will be ignored.
.TP
ra%d: changed types! was %s
A drive somehow changed from one kind to another, e.g., from an RA80
to an RA60.  The driver believes the new type.
.TP
ra%d: %s, size = %d sectors
The named drive is of the given type, and has that many sectors of
user-file area.  This is printed during configuration.
.TP
.RI "uda%d: attempt to get status for ra%d failed: " detail
A status request failed.  The
.I detail
message should tell why.
.TP
ra%d: unit %d, nspt %d, group %d, ntpc %d, rctsize %d,
.br
.ti -5
nrpt %d, nrct %d
.br
Information about the geometry of the named drive.  This is not
used by the driver, but can one setting up
.I disktab
entries, e.g.  Note that the sectors per track, group, and tracks per
cylinder values are those after bad blocking is accounted for, and will
differ slightly from the actual hardware setup.  This message also
reports the MSCP unit number for the drive.  Errors tend to include
only the MSCP unit number, rather than the drive number, since that
is all the driver can tell at the time.
.TP
ra%d: bad block report: %d
The drive has reported the given block as bad.  If there are multiple
bad blocks, the drive will report only the first; in this case this
message will be followed by `+ others'.  Get DEC to forward the
block with EVRLK.
.TP
ra%d: serious exception reported
I have no idea what this really means.
.TP
panic: udareplace
The controller reported completion of a REPLACE operation.  The
driver never issues any REPLACEs, so something is wrong.
.TP
panic: udabb
The controller reported completion of bad block related I/O.  The
driver never issues any such, so something is wrong.
.TP
uda%d: lost interrupt
The controller has gone out to lunch, and is being reset to try to bring
it back.
.TP
panic: mscp_go: AEB_MAX_BP too small
You defined AVOID_EMULEX_BUG and increased NCMDL2 and Emulex has
new firmware.  Raise AEB_MAX_BP or turn off AVOID_EMULEX_BUG.
.TP
uda%d: unit %d: unknown message type 0x%x ignored
The controller responded with a mysterious message type. See
/sys/vax/mscp.h for a list of known message types.  This is probably
a controller hardware problem.
.TP
uda%d: unit %d out of range
The disk drive unit number (the unit plug) is higher than the
maximum number the driver allows (currently 7).
.TP
uda%d: unit %d not configured, \fImessage\fP ignored
The named disk drive has announced its presence to the controller,
but was not, or cannot now be, configured into the running system.
.I Message
is one of `available attention' (an `I am here' message) or
`stray response op 0x%x status 0x%x' (anything else).
.TP
ra%d: bad lbn (%d)?
The drive has reported an invalid command error, probably due to an
invalid block number.  If the lbn value is very much greater than the
size reported by the drive, this is the problem.  It is probably due to
an improperly configured partition table.  Other invalid commands
indicate a bug in the driver, or hardware trouble.
.TP
ra%d: duplicate ONLINE ignored
The drive has come on-line while already on-line.  This condition
can probably be ignored (and has been).
.TP
ra%d: io done, but no buffer?
Hardware trouble, or a bug; the drive has finished an I/O request,
but the response has an invalid (zero) command reference number.
.TP
Emulex SC41/MS screwup: uda%d, got %d correct, then
.br
.ti -5
changed 0x%x to 0x%x
.br
You turned on AVOID_EMULEX_BUG, and the driver successfully
avoided the bug.  The number of correctly-handled requests is
reported, along with the expected and actual values relating to
the bug being avoided.
.TP
panic: unrecoverable Emulex screwup
You turned on AVOID_EMULEX_BUG, but Emulex was too clever and
avoided the avoidance.  Try turning on MSCP_PARANOIA instead.
.TP
uda%d: bad response packet ignored
You turned on MSCP_PARANOIA, and the driver caught the controller in
a lie.  The lie has been ignored, and the controller will soon be
reset (after a `lost' interrupt).  This is followed by a hex dump of
the offending packet.
.TP
ra%d: bogus REPLACE end
The drive has reported finishing a bad sector replacement, but the
driver never issues bad sector replacement commands.  The report
is ignored.  This is likely a hardware problem.
.TP
ra%d: unknown opcode 0x%x status 0x%x ignored
The drive has reported something that the driver cannot understand.
Perhaps DEC has been inventive, or perhaps your hardware is ill.
This is followed by a hex dump of the offending packet.
.TP
uda%d: %s error datagram
The controller has reported some kind of error, either `hard'
(unrecoverable) or `soft' (recoverable).  If the controller is going on
(attempting to fix the problem), this message includes the remark
`(continuing)'.  Emulex controllers wrongly claim that all soft errors
are hard errors.  This message may be followed by
one of the following 5 messages, depending on its type, and will always
be followed by a failure detail message (also listed below).
.RS
.TP
memory addr 0x%x
A host memory access error; this is the address that could not be
read.
.TP
unit %d: level %d retry %d, %s %d
A typical disk error; the retry count and error recovery levels are
printed, along with the block type (`lbn', or logical block; or `rbn',
or replacement block) and number.  If the string is something else, DEC
has been clever, or your hardware has gone to Australia for vacation
(unless you live there; then it might be in New Zealand, or Brazil).
.TP
unit %d: %s %d
Also a disk error, but an `SDI' error, whatever that is.  (I doubt
it has anything to do with Ronald Reagan.)  This lists the block
type (`lbn' or `rbn') and number.
.TP
unit %d: small disk error, cyl %d
Yet another kind of disk error, but for small disks.  (`That's what
it says, guv'nor.  Dunnask me what it means.')
.TP
unit %d: unknown error, format 0x%x
A mysterious error: the given format code is not known.
.RE
.PP
The detail messages are as follows:
.RS
.TP
success (%s) (code 0, subcode %d)
Everything worked, but the controller thought it would let you know
that something went wrong.  No matter what subcode, this can probably
be ignored.
.TP
invalid command (%s) (code 1, subcode %d)
This probably cannot occur unless the hardware is out; %s should be
`invalid msg length', meaning some command was too short or too long.
.TP
command aborted (unknown subcode) (code 2, subcode %d)
This should never occur, as the driver never aborts commands.
.TP
unit offline (%s) (code 3, subcode %d)
The drive is offline, either because it is not around (`unknown
drive'), stopped (`not mounted'), out of order (`inoperative'), has the
same unit number as some other drive (`duplicate'), or has been
disabled for diagnostics (`in diagnosis').
.TP
unit available (unknown subcode) (code 4, subcode %d)
The controller has decided to report a perfectly normal event as
an error.  (Why?)
.TP
media format error (%s) (code 5, subcode %d)
The drive cannot be used without reformatting.  The Format Control
Table cannot be read (`fct unread - edc'), there is a bad sector
header (`invalid sector header'), the drive is not set for 512-byte
sectors (`not 512 sectors'), the drive is not formatted (`not formatted'),
or the FCT has an uncorrectable ECC error (`fct ecc').
.TP
write protected (%s) (code 6, subcode %d)
The drive is write protected, either by the front panel switch
(`hardware') or via the driver (`software').  The driver never
sets software write protect.
.TP
compare error (unknown subcode) (code 7, subcode %d)
A compare operation showed some sort of difference.  The driver
never uses compare operations.
.TP
data error (%s) (code 7, subcode %d)
Something went wrong reading or writing a data sector.  A `forced
error' is a software-asserted error used to mark a sector that contains
suspect data.  Rewriting the sector will clear the forced error.  This
is normally set only during bad block replacment, and the driver does
no bad block replacement, so these should not occur.  A `header
compare' error probably means the block is shot.  A `sync timeout'
presumably has something to do with sector synchronisation.
An `uncorrectable ecc' error is an ordinary data error that cannot
be fixed via ECC logic.  A `%d symbol ecc' error is a data error
that can be (and presumably has been) corrected by the ECC logic.
It might indicate a sector that is imperfect but usable, or that
is starting to go bad.  If any of these errors recur, the sector
may need to be replaced.
.TP
host buffer access error (%s) (code %d, subcode %d)
Something went wrong while trying to copy data to or from the host
(Vax).  The subcode is one of `odd xfer addr', `odd xfer count',
`non-exist. memory', or `memory parity'.  The first two could be a
software glitch; the last two indicate hardware problems.
.TP
controller error (%s) (code %d, subcode %d)
The controller has detected a hardware error in itself.  A
`serdes overrun' is a serialiser / deserialiser overrun; `edc'
probably stands for `error detection code'; and `inconsistent
internal data struct' is obvious.
.TP
drive error (%s) (code %d, subcode %d)
Either the controller or the drive has detected a hardware error
in the drive.  I am not sure what an `sdi command timeout' is, but
these seem to occur benignly on occasion.  A `ctlr detected protocol'
error means that the controller and drive do not agree on a protocol;
this could be a cabling problem, or a version mismatch.  A `positioner'
error means the drive seek hardware is ailing; `lost rd/wr ready'
means the drive read/write logic is sick; and `drive clock dropout'
means that the drive clock logic is bad, or the media is hopelessly
scrambled.  I have no idea what `lost recvr ready' means.  A `drive 
detected error' is a catch-all for drive hardware trouble; `ctlr
detected pulse or parity' errors are often caused by cabling problems.
