.SH NAME
mtio \- UNIX magtape interface
.SH DESCRIPTION
The files
.I "mt0, ..., mt15"
refer to the UNIX magtape drives,
which may be on the MASSBUS using the TM03 formatter
.IR ht (4),
or TM78 formatter,
.IR mt (4),
or on the UNIBUS using either the TM11 or TS11 formatters
.IR tm (4),
TU45 compatible formatters,
.IR ut (4),
or
.IR ts (4).
The following description applies to any of the transport/controller pairs.
The files
.I "mt0, ..., mt7"
are 800bpi, 
.I "mt8, ..., mt15"
are 1600bpi, and
.I "mt16, ..., mt23"
are 6250bpi.
(But note that only 1600 bpi is available with the TS11.)
The files
.IR "mt0, ..., mt3" ,
.IR "mt8, ..., mt11" ,
and
.I "mt16, ..., mt19"
are rewound when closed; the others are not.
When a file open for writing is closed, two end-of-files are written.
If the tape is not to be rewound
it is positioned with the head between the two
tapemarks.
.PP
A standard tape consists of a
series of 1024 byte records terminated by an
end-of-file.
To the extent possible, the system makes
it possible, if inefficient, to treat
the tape like any other file.
Seeks have their usual meaning and it is possible
to read or write a byte at a time.
Writing in very small units is inadvisable,
however, because it tends to create monstrous record
gaps.
.PP
The
.I mt
files discussed above are useful
when it is desired to access the tape in a way
compatible with ordinary files.
When foreign tapes are to be dealt with, and especially
when long records are to be read or written, the
`raw' interface is appropriate.
The associated files are named
.I "rmt0, ..., rmt23,"
but the same minor-device considerations as for the regular files still apply.
A number of other ioctl operations are available
on raw magnetic tape.

.PP
Each
.I read
or
.I write
call reads or writes the next record on the tape.
In the write case the record has the same length as the
buffer given.
During a read, the record size is passed
back as the number of bytes read, provided it is no greater
than the buffer size;
if the record is long, an error is indicated.
In raw tape I/O seeks are ignored.
A zero byte count is returned when a tape mark is read,
but another read will fetch the first record of the
new tape file.
