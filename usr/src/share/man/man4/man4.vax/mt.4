.SH DESCRIPTION
The tm78/tu-78 combination provides a standard tape drive

Only 1600 and 6250 bpi are supported; the
TU-78 runs at 125 ips and autoloads tapes.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
\fBmu%d: no write ring\fR.  An attempt was made to write on the tape drive
when no write ring was present; this message is written on the terminal of
the user who tried to access the tape.
.PP
\fBmu%d: not online\fR.  An attempt was made to access the tape while it
was offline; this message is written on the terminal of the user
who tried to access the tape.
.PP
\fBmu%d: can't switch density in mid-tape\fR.  An attempt was made to write
on a tape at a different density than is already recorded on the tape.
This message is written on the terminal of the user who tried to switch
the density.
.PP
\fBmu%d: hard error bn%d mbsr=%b er=%x ds=%b\fR.   A tape error occurred
at block \fIbn\fR; the mt error register and drive status register are
printed in octal with the bits symbolically decoded.  Any error is
fatal on non-raw tape; when possible the driver will have retried
the operation which failed several times before reporting the error.
.PP
\fBmu%d: blank tape\fP.
An attempt was made to read a blank tape (a tape without even
end-of-file marks).
.PP
\fBmu%d: offline\fP.
During an i/o operation the device was set offline.  If a
non-raw tape was used in the access it is closed.
.SH BUGS
If any non-data error is encountered on non-raw tape,
it refuses to do anything more until closed.
