.SH NAME
dmc \- DEC DMC-11/DMR-11 point-to-point communications device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "device dmc0 at uba0 csr 167600 vector dmcrint dmcxint"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I dmc
interface provides access to a point-to-point communications
device which runs at either 1 Mb/s or 56 Kb/s.  DMC-11's communicate
using the DEC DDCMP link layer protocol.
.PP
The
.I dmc
interface driver also supports a DEC DMR-11 providing point-to-point
communication running at data rates from 2.4 Kb/s to 1 Mb/s.
DMR-11's are a more recent design and thus are preferred over DMC-11's.
.PP
The host's address must be specified with an SIOCSIFADDR ioctl
before the interface will transmit or recive any packets.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.BR "dmc%d: bad control %o" .
A bad parameter was passed to the
.I dmcload
routine.
.PP
.BR "dmc%d: unknown address type %d" .
An input packet was received which contained a type of
address unknown to the driver.
.PP
.BR "DMC FATAL ERROR 0%o" .
.PP
.BR "DMC SOFT ERROR 0%o" .
.PP
.BR "dmc%d: af%d not supported" . 
The interface was handed a message which has
addresses formatted in an unsuitable address family.

.SH BUGS
Should allow multiple outstanding DMA requests, but due to
the design of the current UNIBUS support routines this is
very difficult.
