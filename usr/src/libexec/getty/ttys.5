.SH NAME
ttys \- terminal initialization data
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I ttys
file is read by the
.I init
program and specifies
which terminal special files are to have
a process created for them which will allow people to
log in.
It contains one line per special file.
.PP
The first character of a line is either `0' or `1';
the former causes the line to be ignored,
the latter causes it to be effective.
The second character is used as an argument to
.IR getty (8),
which performs such tasks as baud-rate recognition,
reading the login name,
and calling
.I login.
For normal lines,
the character is `0';
other characters can be used, for example, with hard-wired terminals
where speed recognition is unnecessary
or which have special characteristics.
.RI ( Getty
will have to be fixed in such cases.)
The remainder of the line is the terminal's entry
in the device directory, /dev.
