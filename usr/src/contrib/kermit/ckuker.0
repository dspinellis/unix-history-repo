NAME
     kermit - kermit file transfer

SYNOPSIS
     kermit [ option ...] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     _K_e_r_m_i_t is a file transfer program that allows files to be
     moved between machines of many different operating systems
     and architectures.  This man page describes version 4C of
     the program.

     Arguments are optional. If _K_e_r_m_i_t is executed without argu-
     ments, it will enter command mode. Otherwise, _k_e_r_m_i_t will
     read the arguments off the command line and interpret them.

     The following notation is used in command descriptions:

     _f_n      A Unix file specification, possibly containing
	     either of the "wildcard" characters '*' or '?' ('*'
	     matches all character strings, '?' matches any sin-
	     gle character).

     _f_n_1     A Unix file specification which may not contain '*'
	     or '?'.

     _r_f_n     A remote file specification in the remote system's
	     own syntax, which may denote a single file or a
	     group of files.

     _r_f_n_1    A remote file specification which should denote only
	     a single file.

     _n	     A decimal number between 0 and 94.

     _c	     A decimal number between 0 and 127 representing the
	     value of an ASCII character.

     _c_c      A decimal number between 0 and 31, or else exactly
	     127, representing the value of an ASCII control
	     character.

     [ ]     Any field in square braces is optional.

     {_x,_y,_z} Alternatives are listed in curly braces.

     _K_e_r_m_i_t command line options may specify either actions or
     settings.	If _K_e_r_m_i_t is invoked with a command line that
     specifies no actions, then it will issue a prompt and begin
     interactive dialog.  Action options specify either protocol
     transactions or terminal connection.

     COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

     -s _f_n   Send the specified file or files. If _f_n contains
	     wildcard (meta) characters, the Unix shell expands
	     it into a list.  If _f_n is '-' then _K_e_r_m_i_t sends from
	     standard input, which must come from a file:
9			 kermit -s - < foo.bar
9	     or a parallel process:
9			 ls -l | kermit -s -

	     You cannot use this mechanism to send terminal
	     typein.  If you want to send a file whose name is
	     "-" you can precede it with a path name, as in
9			 kermit -s ./-

     -r      Receive a file or files.  Wait passively for files
	     to arrive.

     -k      Receive (passively) a file or files, sending them to
	     standard output.  This option can be used in several
	     ways:
9		     kermit -k

	     Displays the incoming files on your screen; to be
	     used only in "local mode" (see below).
9		     kermit -k > fn1

	     Sends the incoming file or files to the named file,
	     _f_n_1. If more than one file arrives, all are con-
	     catenated together into the single file _f_n_1.
9		     kermit -k | command

	     Pipes the incoming data (single or multiple files)
	     to the indicated command, as in
9		     kermit -k | sort > sorted.stuff

     -a _f_n_1  If you have specified a file transfer option, you
	     may specify an alternate name for a single file with
	     the -a option.  For example,
9		     kermit -s foo -a bar

	     sends the file foo telling the receiver that its
	     name is bar.  If more than one file arrives or is
	     sent, only the first file is affected by the -a
	     option:
9		     kermit -ra baz

KERMIT(1C)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	       KERMIT(1C)



	     stores the first incoming file under the name baz.

     -x      Begin server operation.  May be used in either local
	     or remote mode.

     Before proceeding, a few words about remote and local opera-
     tion are  necessary.  _K_e_r_m_i_t is "local" if it is running on
     a PC or workstation that you are using directly, or if it is
     running on a multiuser system and transferring files over an
     external communication line - not your job's controlling
     terminal or console.  _K_e_r_m_i_t is remote if it is running on a
     multiuser system and transferring files over its own con-
     trolling terminal's communication line, connected to your PC
     or workstation.

     If you are running _K_e_r_m_i_t on a PC, it is in local mode by
     default, with the "back port" designated for file transfer
     and terminal connection.  If you are running _K_e_r_m_i_t on a
     multiuser (timesharing) system, it is in remote mode unless
     you explicitly point it at an external line for file
     transfer or terminal connection.  The following command sets
     _K_e_r_m_i_t's "mode":

     -l _d_e_v  Line - Specify a terminal line to use for file
	     transfer and terminal connection, as in
9			 kermit -l /dev/ttyi5

     When an external line is being used, you might also need
     some additional options for successful communication with
     the remote system:

     -b _n Baud - Specify the baud rate for the line given in the
	  -l option, as in
9		      kermit -l /dev/ttyi5 -b 9600

	  This option should always be included with the -l
	  option, since the speed of an external line is not
	  necessarily what you expect.

     -p _x Parity - e, o, m, s, n (even, odd, mark, space, or
	  none).  If parity is other than none, then the 8th-bit
	  prefixing mechanism will be used for transferring 8-bit
	  binary data, provided the opposite _K_e_r_m_i_t agrees. The
	  default parity is none.

     -t   Specifies half duplex, line turnaround with XON as the
	  handshake character.

     The following commands may be used only with a _K_e_r_m_i_t which
     is local - either by default or else because the -l option
     has been specified.

KERMIT(1C)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	       KERMIT(1C)



     -g _r_f_n  Actively request a remote server to send the named
	     file or files; _r_f_n is a file specification in the
	     remote host's own syntax.	If _f_n happens to contain
	     any special shell characters, like '*', these must
	     be quoted, as in
9			 kermit -g x\*.\?

     -f      Send a 'finish' command to a remote server.

     -c      Establish a terminal connection over the specified
	     or default communication line, before any protocol
	     transaction takes place.  Get back to the local sys-
	     tem by typing the escape character (normally
	     Control-Backslash) followed by the letter 'c'.

     -n      Like -c, but after a protocol transaction takes
	     place; -c and -n may both be used in the same com-
	     mand.  The use of -n and -c is illustrated below.

     On a timesharing system, the -l and -b options will also
     have to be included with the -r, -k, or -s options if the
     other _K_e_r_m_i_t is on a remote system.

     If _k_e_r_m_i_t is in local mode, the screen (stdout) is con-
     tinously updated to show the progress of the file transer.
     A dot is printed for every four data packets, other packets
     are shown by type (e.g. 'S' for Send-Init), 'T' is printed
     when there's a timeout, and '%' for each retransmission.  In
     addition, you may type (to stdin) certain "interrupt" com-
     mands during file transfer:

	  Control-F:  Interrupt the current File, and go on to
	  the next (if any).

	  Control-B:  Interrupt the entire Batch of files, ter-
	  minate the transaction.

	  Control-R:  Resend the current packet

	  Control-A:  Display a status report for the current
	  transaction.


     These interrupt characters differ from the ones used in
     other _K_e_r_m_i_t implementations to avoid conflict with Unix
     shell interrupt characters.  With System III and System V
     implementations of Unix, interrupt commands must be pre-
     ceeded by the escape character (e.g. control-\).

     Several other command-line options are provided:

KERMIT(1C)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	       KERMIT(1C)



     -i      Specifies that files should be sent or received
	     exactly "as is" with no conversions.  This option is
	     necessary for transmitting binary files.  It may
	     also be used to slightly boost efficiency in Unix-
	     to-Unix transfers of text files by eliminating
	     CRLF/newline conversion.

     -w      Write-Protect - Avoid filename collisions for incom-
	     ing files.

     -q      Quiet - Suppress screen update during file transfer,
	     for instance to allow a file transfer to proceed in
	     the background.

     -d      Debug - Record debugging information in the file
	     debug.log in the current directory.  Use this option
	     if you believe the program is misbehaving, and show
	     the resulting log to your local _K_e_r_m_i_t maintainer.

     -h      Help - Display a brief synopsis of the command line
	     options.

     The command line may contain no more than one protocol
     action option.

     INTERACTIVE OPERATION

     _K_e_r_m_i_t's interactive command prompt is "C-Kermit>". In
     response to this prompt, you may type any valid command.
     _K_e_r_m_i_t executes the command and then prompts you for another
     command.  The process continues until you instruct the pro-
     gram to terminate.

     Commands begin with a keyword, normally an English verb,
     such as "send".  You may omit trailing characters from any
     keyword, so long as you specify sufficient characters to
     distinguish it from any other keyword valid in that field.
     Certain commonly-used keywords (such as "send", "receive",
     "connect") have special non-unique abbreviations ("s" for
     "send", "r" for "receive", "c" for "connect").

     Certain characters have special functions in interactive
     commands:

     ?	     Question mark, typed at any point in a command, will
	     produce a message explaining what is possible or
	     expected at that point.  Depending on the context,
	     the message may be a brief phrase, a menu of key-
	     words, or a list of files.

     ESC     (The Escape or Altmode key) - Request completion of
	     the current keyword or filename, or insertion of a

KERMIT(1C)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	       KERMIT(1C)



	     default value.  The result will be a beep if the
	     requested operation fails.

     DEL     (The Delete or Rubout key) - Delete the previous
	     character from the command.  You may also use BS
	     (Backspace, Control-H) for this function.

     ^W      (Control-W) - Erase the rightmost word from the com-
	     mand line.

     ^U      (Control-U) - Erase the entire command.

     ^R      (Control-R) - Redisplay the current command.

     SP      (Space) - Delimits fields (keywords, filenames,
	     numbers) within a command.  HT (Horizontal Tab) may
	     also be used for this purpose.

     CR      (Carriage Return) - Enters the command for execu-
	     tion.  LF (Linefeed) or FF (formfeed) may also be
	     used for this purpose.

     \	     (Backslash) - Enter any of the above characters into
	     the command, literally.  To enter a backslash, type
	     two backslashes in a row (\\).  A single backslash
	     immediately preceding a carriage return allows you
	     to continue the command on the next line.


     You may type the editing characters (DEL, ^W, etc) repeat-
     edly, to delete all the way back to the prompt.  No action
     will be performed until the command is entered by typing
     carriage return, linefeed, or formfeed.  If you make any
     mistakes, you will receive an informative error message and
     a new prompt - make liberal use of '?' and ESC to feel your
     way through the commands.	One important command is "help" -
     you should use it the first time you run _K_e_r_m_i_t.

     Interactive _K_e_r_m_i_t accepts commands from files as well as
     from the keyboard.  When you enter interactive mode, _K_e_r_m_i_t
     looks for the file .kermrc in your home or current directory
     (first it looks in the home directory, then in the current
     one) and executes any commands it finds there.  These com-
     mands must be in interactive format, not Unix command-line
     format.  A "take" command is also provided for use at any
     time during an interactive session.  Command files may be
     nested to any reasonable depth.

     Here is a brief list of _K_e_r_m_i_t interactive commands:
9     !		 Execute a Unix shell command.
9     bye	 Terminate and log out a remote _K_e_r_m_i_t server.
