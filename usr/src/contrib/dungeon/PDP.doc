The implementation of dungeon on unix systems
Randy Dietrich 		17 Nov 1981

When we set out to get dungeon running on unix we figured
it wouldn't be too big a problem.  After all a fortran
compiler (F77) existed and with relatively little problem
managed to get everything to compile.  
Then the Zorkmids hit the volcano.
We thought that a program which would run in 28k on an
RSX system would have fit just fine in 64k, especially
with seperate i & d.  We did not realize just how hostile 
unix is to FORTRAN programs.
The first link indicated about 130 k (text only) was needed
for the whole game (Ieeeeee).  Recompiling with short (I2)
integers brought this down to about 100k.  Throwing out
the game debug package (9k) and the save and restore code (3k)
got us to within 20k.  
At this point we discovered that the fortran library that
was being used was about 25k (A HA !!).  If we could just 
eliminate that we would be in business.  A great game with
no I/O !!  further work allowed us to write the I/O in C
with the bulk of the game using only standard input and output.
The initialization and message printing were "moved out"
into seperate processes and the whole mess piped together.
it is a real kludge but seems to work (mostly).

The Input process is called 'listen'.  It first reads the init
file and shoves it in the pipe and then switches to pass
keyboard input to the main game.  This keeps the main program
from having to read anything but 'standard input'.

The output process is currently called 'speak'.
this process does the lookup in the file 'dtext.dat' and
sends out the messages that give dungeon it's flavor.  This
process also passes clear text from the main program to
allow the output of other messages for such things as the
echo room, puzzle room, and score.  These functions
were also 'moved out' so the main program would not have
to access any disc files.

The main program is sandwitched between listen and speak.
It really does the work of the game.  I/O is handled
thorugh C routines in 'cio.c'. this keeps any fortran
I/O from being used and calling in the whole #$%@ fortran
library.

The current lash-up does save or restore but not both.  
It is going to take a while to work in as we are out of room
in the main program and will have to re-write something
to make it all fit.  I guess we will just have to play
without being able to cheat for a while.

Restores are done by initializing the game with a second argument
(some day the file name) of 'r'.  This causes the init process 
to send a 'R' down down the pipe followed by the restore data.
normally the init process ends with a '?'.  The trailing '?'
will follow the restore data.

Saves are done from within the game.  The game sends a 's'
down the pipe to signal the speak process to do a save opperation.
The save data then goes down the pipe followed by 'e' to
signal the end of data.  The save data is 'dungeon.sav'.
