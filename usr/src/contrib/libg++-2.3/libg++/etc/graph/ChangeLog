	* graph.c (main):  exit(-1) on bad args.

Fri Jun 26 11:36:15 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* read_data.cc:  istream::get(char&) can never set the char
	to EOF (except accidentally), so don't compare the char to EOF.
	The istream::good() test subsumes it anyway.  Also, use
	standard istream::putback instead of non-standard unget().

	* tick_interval.{cc,h}:  Renamed to tick_intvl.{cc,h} to
	fit in 14 characters.
	* Makefile.in, graph.cc, ...:  Update correspondingly.

Sat Feb  1 12:55:13 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* graph.cc, ePlotFile.h, read_data.{C,h}:
	Convert to using iostreams facility.
	* Makefile.in:
	* read_data.cc, read_data.h:  Combine overloaded read_data()
	function into a single function.
	Pass extra filename parameter to read_data (for error
	messages, since istream::name() is no longer supported).
	* graph.cc:  Combine to use the single read_data() function.
	* Makefile.in:  Add $(srcdir)/ as appropriate.

Fri Oct  5 12:29:03 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at kappa)

	* graph.cc: added the option `-S -1' (i.e. symbol_number == -1)
	which specifies that symbols are not to be drawn.  This is a slight
	change from the old convention, but is not consistent with the way
	line_mode is handled, and both will behave better when `-K' or
	`-M' are chosen respecively.

Thu Oct  4 15:59:19 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at taj)

	* graph.cc: the option `-m -1' (i.e. line_style == -1) means that
	lines are not drawn between points.  This allows you to plot
	symbols alone at each point.

Tue Jan 16 14:44:46 1990  Rich Murphey  (rich at kalliope)

	* graph.cc: added ability to specify the position of the labels
	  on the x and y axes using the letters R or L and T or B to indicate
	  whether the labels appear on the left or right and top or bottom
	  of the plot.  Also added a description of this to graph.tex.

	* graph.cc: added command line options to specify that the
	  line style (-L) or symbol (-K) changes whenever the abcissal
	  data decreases in value.

	* graph.tex: added description of -K and -L options.

Wed Jan  3 12:43:46 1990  Doug Lea  (dl at g.oswego.edu)

        * graph.cc: replaced sprintf calls with dtoa, since sprintf
        is apparently pretty broken on some systems.

        * eGetOpt, ePlotFile: explicilty list constructrs, since g++
        no longer allows inheritence of ctors.

Sun Dec  3 21:21:17 1989  Carey R. Murphey  (rich at kalliope)

	* graph.cc: add margins beteen edges of the data and the box
	  only if the scale is not logarithmic.  Otherwise the
	  additional margin could cause the value at the end of the
	  axis to be negative.

Wed Nov  8 20:59:38 1989  Carey R. Murphey  (rich at kalliope)

        * The -c option was incompatible with other versions of graph.
	  Changed graph.cc to use this option to specify a default
	  label to be printed at each data point.  Symbols can be
	  specified now using the `-S' option.

	* Added the option `-z' to prevent graph from reading the standard
	  input.

	* split out read_data, tick_interval, eGetOpt, and ePlotFile
	  into separate files.  Had to change the arguments to read_data
	  to include what used to be passed through global data.

	* graph.cc: changed expressions using ?: to use >? or <? to
	  find the minimum of ints.

Mon Nov  6 09:50:25 1989  Carey R. Murphey  (rich at kalliope)

	* If there is no data, we can still draw a frame around the
	  plot with axes and tick marks.  Added if (point.length()=0)
	  around the code which searches for upper and lower bounds
	  on the data.  Added it likewise before the code which plots
	  the data points.

Fri Nov  3 12:51:08 1989  Carey R. Murphey  (rich at kalliope)

	* Removed clipping of output coordinates and replaced it with
	  a warning.  Now you can generate coordinates which may cause
	  plot to choke, but you will be warned.

	* added ^L's and comments before each major part of the program.
	  C-x ] puts you at a comment for the next section of code.

	* shortened inline functions for transformation of coordinates, px,
	  py, fx, and fy, to a single expression.  Separated out clipping into
	  a new function, clip, which returns a value between 0 and PLOTSIZE.

	* made usage and copyright notices constants.

    	* skip white space after reading y coordinate and label
	  so that the test for istream.good() will detect end of file
	  immediately and drop out of the read loop before trying
	  to read the next coordinate.
