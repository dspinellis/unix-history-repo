.SH NAME
huntd \- hunt daemon, back-end for hunt game
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB/usr/games/lib/huntd\fP [ \fB\-s\fP ] [ \fB\-p\fP port ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I huntd
controls the multi-player
.IR hunt (6)
game.
When it starts up, it tries to notify all members of the
.I hunt-players
mailing list (see
.IR sendmail (8))
by faking a
.IR talk (1)
request from user ``Hunt Game''.
.PP
The
.B \-s
option is for running
.I huntd
forever (server mode).
This is similar to running it under the control of
.I inetd
(see below),
but it consumes a process table entry when no one is playing.
.PP
The
.B \-p
option changes the udp port number used to rendezvous with the player
process and thus allows for private games of hunt.
This option turns off the notification of players on the
.I hunt-players
mailing list.
.SH INETD
.PP
To run
.I huntd
from
.IR inetd ,
you'll need to put the
.I hunt
service in
.BR /etc/services :
.IP
hunt 26740/udp		# multi-player/multi-host mazewars
.LP
and add a line in
.BR /etc/inetd.conf :
.IP
hunt dgram udp wait nobody /usr/games/lib/huntd HUNT
.LP
except for Suns which use
.BR /etc/servers :
.IP
hunt udp /usr/games/lib/huntd
.LP
Do not use any of the command line options \(em if you want
.I inetd
to start up
.I huntd
on a private port, change the port listed in
.BR /etc/services .
.SH "NETWORK RENDEZVOUS"
When
.IR hunt (6)
starts up, it broadcasts on the local area net
(using the broadcast address for each interface) to find a
.I hunt
game in progress.
If a
.I huntd
hears the request, it sends back the port number for the
.I hunt
process to connect to.
Otherwise, the
.I hunt
process starts up a
.I huntd
on the local machine and trys to rendezvous with it.
