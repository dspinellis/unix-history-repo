By convention, a lib file just defines functions, objects and variales.
(The regression test is an exception.)  Also by convention, the a usage
message regarding each important object and function is printed at
the time of the read.  This message printing may be disabled by assigning
the global value  lib_debug  to a numeric value > 0.
