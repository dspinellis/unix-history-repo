Dear Mr Hyver,

.PP
This is a proposal for support by Hewlett-Packard of operating
system and networking research in the \s-1UNIX\s0 project in the Computer
Science Division of the University of California, Berkeley, known as
the Computer Systems Research Group (\s-1CSRG\s0).
The goal of the project
is to use leading edge research ideas in a stable and reliable
implementation that solves current problems in operating systems research.
The project also includes incorporation of network protocols and other
subsystems into the operating system while maintaining consistency
with the existing system call interface.
The resulting system is widely used by other
researchers in operating systems and network protocols.
The most recent two releases, \s-14.2BSD\s0
and \s-14.3BSD\s0, provide the
core of the standard networking and/or operating system software for
essentially all vendors of \s-1UNIX\s0-based workstations and minicomputers.
\s-14.3BSD\s0-based network support will be included in the next systems to
be released by both \s-1OSF\s0 and \s-1AT&T\s0.
.PP
\s-1CSRG\s0 includes three full-time research staff (Mike Karels, Kirk
McKusick and Keith Bostic), one three-quarter-time programmer on loan
from another group (Keith Sklower), and one software engineer
currently on loan from Digital Equipment Corporation (Marc Teitelbaum).
In addition, two full-time administrative and secretarial people
handle licensing and software distribution as well as office support.
.PP
Current funding for \s-1CSRG\s0 is provided by the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (\s-1DARPA\s0) via the National Institute for
Science and Technology (\s-1NIST\s0, formerly \s-1NBS\s0).
The current grant from \s-1NIST\s0
will expire about April 1, 1990.
By mutual agreement,
further funding from \s-1DARPA\s0 is not expected.
We propose that Hewlett-Packard begin support of \s-1CSRG\s0
with donations of workstations and financial support as the group
makes the transition from \s-1DARPA\s0 funding to other sources of funding.
.PP
Equipment needs for \s-1CSRG\s0 in the coming year include replacement
of obsolete Sun Workstations (model 3/50) with faster, more modern
workstations.
To improve the distributed computing
environment within \s-1CSRG\s0, it is desirable to replace
older workstations with models for which \s-14.3BSD\s0 support is available.
The only such workstations at the present are
the 680x0-based series of Hewlett-Packard
workstations.
This will allow us to run our software on our
workstations as well as the central minicomputers currently in use.
To completely replace the existing workstations, we would need a total
of six machines.
One machine with about one gigabyte of \s-1SCSI\s0-based
disk storage would serve as a file server, and three other machines
would be used as local workstations supported by that file server.
An option for \s-1SMD\s0-based disk storage would be desirable for the file
server, allowing existing disks to be moved to the new file server.
The remaining two workstations would be used by senior research staff
from their home offices, using dedicated serial-line links for network access.
These machines would be used two to four days per week.
.PP
Financial support from Hewlett-Packard is also requested.
A donation on the order of $200,000 to $300,000 would provide roughly
half of the budget needed by \s-1CSRG\s0 in the next year for salaries and
benefits, maintenance and network access fees, travel and other expenses.
.PP
\s-1CSRG\s0 anticipates that its next major release, tentatively called
\s-14.4BSD\s0, will be completed and begin shipment during the time frame of
the proposed support by Hewlett-Packard.
The file system interface
will be extended to allow greater flexibility and performance, and a
public-domain version of \s-1NFS\s0 is expected to be included.
The new system includes integration of an implementation of the
\s-1ISO OSI\s0 networking protocols into the existing
socket interface and internal network architecture.
This work will include a revised internal network
architecture incorporating the best features of both the existing
socket support and the ``streams'' layering of the Ninth Edition
research version of \s-1UNIX\s0.
Both file system and networking interfaces
improve upon previous work with better support for caching in layered
architectures.
These caching techniques are based on work done by Van
Jacobson at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, and will be fully
exploited by the \s-1TCP/IP\s0 networking protocols.
The applicability of
these techniques in the \s-1OSI\s0 protocol suite will be investigated as
well.
.PP
The system will also include an \s-1IEEE\s0 P1003.1 \s-1(POSIX)\s0 standard
operating system interface integrated with the existing system
interface in such a way that both interfaces are fully supported and
interoperate fully.
Finally, the system is expected to include a new
virtual memory system derived from that of the Mach operating system
from \s-1CMU\s0 and incorporated into \s-14.3BSD\s0 by the University of Utah.
We expect that the products of this work will become the interfaces and
implementations of choice for other operating systems and networking
researchers in the near future.
