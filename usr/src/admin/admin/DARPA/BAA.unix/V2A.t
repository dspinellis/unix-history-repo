\fIProductivity Engineering in the \s-2UNIX\s+2 Environment\fP,
which has provided research and/or infrastructure support to most
members of the Computer Science Division at various times.
Professor Graham serves on the departmental Computer Needs and
Resources committee.
.PP
Professor Ferrari will be responsible managing graduate
students that are working on software projects related to
the project and for acting as a liaison to the
Computer Science Department.

The staff for the proposed facility will consist of five technical
people, a business manager, and a grant administrator.
The salaries  of the business manager and grant administrator
will be paid either directly by the campus,

Dr. Marshall Kirk McKusick together with Michael J. Karels
will be responsible for setting the research directions
of the project and managing the other programmers
associated with the project.
Dr. McKusick has been the Research Computer Scientist

Mr. Karels has been the Principal Programmer associated with
the project since 1983.
.PP
Keith Bostic will be the person primarily responsible for
the security audit of the system.
He has been associated with the project since 1986.
His jobs have consisted of liaisoning with outside research groups,
handling bug reports,
and integrating outside software into the BSD system.
.PP
Keith Sklower will be made available to work on the ISO Networking
part of the project from the Computer Systems Support Group (CSSG),
which provides hardware and software
services to the department on a recharge basis.
Professor Richard Newton of EECS ably directs CSSG, and has been
instrumental in establishing effective recharge procedures,
budgetary controls, and work scheduling.
The existence of CSSG has enabled the department to benefit from a
pooled collection of spare parts, from shared maintenance
arrangements, and from the flexibility to move staff around as needed.
CSSG also provides senior staff supervision of hardware and 
software technicians employed by a particular project or research
group, if requested.
The faculty sets direction and policy in all cases.
.PP
The final programmer will be either be made available from CSSG or
else hired to handle the evaluation
and integration of an authentication service into the BSD system.
He will also be responsible for making the BSD system
compliant with the Internet Host Requirements.
.PP
The business manager will be Ms. Diane Leite,
who currently has the same responsibility for the \s-2DARPA\s+2
project mentioned above.
She was formerly on the staff of the campus Sponsored Projects
Office and is familiar with the various campus and government
procedures.
She will supervise a full-time grant administrator who will
take care of the day-to-day business and clerical needs of the facility.
We have used a similar structure in all of our large
multi-investigator projects in the department and have found it to
be very successful.
