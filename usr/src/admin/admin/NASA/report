Dear Dr. Woodward,
.PP
This letter and accompanying report consitute our semi-annual
status update on NASA grant NAG 2-763, covering the period of
February 1, 1992 through July 31, 1992.

During this period we have completed the alpha distribution
of 4.4BSD. 
The attached report is a letter sent to our past licensees
describing this alpha distribution.
During the remaining half year of the grant we plan to incorporate
bug fixes and enhancements to this alpha distribution and prepare
and release a polished 4.4BSD distribution.
