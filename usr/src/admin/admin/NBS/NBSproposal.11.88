Introduction
.PP
This is a proposal for DARPA support of operating system
and networking research in the UNIX project at UC Berkeley.
The goal of the project is to use leading edge research ideas
in a stable and reliable implementation that solves current problems in
operating systems research.
The project also includes incorporation of network protocols and other
subsystems into the operating system while maintaining consistency
with the existing system call interface.
The resulting system is widely used by other researchers in operating systems
and network protocols and implementations.
.PP
The last major release of Berkeley UNIX,
in June, 1986, was 4.3BSD [CSRG86].
Projects completed since that time have been made available
in a July, 1988 test release known as the 4.3BSD Tahoe release,
named for the CCI Power 6/32 processor for which support was added.
.NH
Proposed Research
.PP
Since the 4.3BSD release,
we have been working on four major new areas of research,
which we propose to continue:
.IP 1)
Integration of an OSI network protocol suite and
existing ISO applications into Berkeley UNIX.
Several protocol layers were originally implemented
at the University of Wisconsin.
The network architecture and system interface of 4.2BSD accommodates
multiple network protocol families and address formats,
although some extensions have been required to accommodate
certain protocol features.
Ongoing work includes development of those interfaces
and a more flexible kernel routing interface.
.IP 2)
Support for an interface compliant
with the P1003.1 POSIX standard recently approved by the IEEE.
Converting the kernel to be POSIX compliant requires
the completion of several new kernel facilities including
a new terminal driver and job control facilities.
.IP 3)
Refinement of the network architecture
and implementation to improve
its performance and functionality.
Since the most recent networking release,
additional performance experiments have been done by
Van Jacobson of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory;
the resulting performance improvements are ready
to be merged into the Berkeley TCP.
.IP 4)
Provision of a standard interface to file systems
so that multiple local and remote file systems can be supported,
much as multiple networking protocols are supported by 4.3BSD.
The proposal currently under development
adopts the 4.3BSD calling convention for file name lookup
but otherwise is closely related to Sun's VFS.
We ultimately hope to support a public domain implementation of Sun's NFS.
.LP
In addition to the four projects already underway,
we will add a fifth project, expanding on work already done:
.IP 5)
The recent invasion of the DARPA Internet by a quickly reproducing worm
highlighted the need for a thorough review of the access
safeguards built into the system.
We will conduct a complete audit of the system
utilities,
especially network servers,
to check for and eliminate unintended system access mechanisms.
Part of this proposal includes the addition and integration of a real
authentication mechanism for utilities such as
telnet, login, remote shell, etc.
.LP
An expanded description of each of these projects is provided
in the following five subsections.
.NH 2
OSI Network Protocol Development
.PP
The network architecture of 4.2BSD was designed to accommodate
multiple network protocol families and address formats.
The current prototype implementation of the ISO OSI network protocols
makes use of all the existing facilities, but will be aided by
some architectural changes.
.PP
The architectural changes that have already been completed include
improved network buffer layouts,
changes to allow variable length network addresses,
and the construction of a uniform
hierarchical routing lookup algorithm.
We have made alterations to the socket interface to allow
transmission of record boundaries,
distinction between dequeuing connection requests and explicit
confirmation, and passage of ancillary data such as user connection-
or disconnection-request data.
.PP
At the beginning of the period covered by this proposal,
we expect to have initial versions of
the OSI connectionless internet protocol (CLNP),
an OSI transport class 4 (TP-4) implementation,
device drivers for 802.2/802.3,
and the End System to Intermediate System (ES-IS) protocol.
We will add support for X.25 interfaces using CLNP
and will then develop a software layer allowing connection-oriented access
to X.25 as well as packet-switching service.
We will investigate a more general framework for 802.2-based link-level
interfaces with more graceful support of ES-IS and related protocols.
If hardware is available, we will incorporate support for 802.5 and/or
ProNET-80 token rings.
We will receive an updated ISO Development Environment (ISODE)
and incorporate this into the Berkeley Software Distribution.
ISODE implements the session and presentation layers of the OSI protocol suite,
and will include an implementation of the file transfer protocol FTAM.
If possible, an X.400 implementation now being done at University College,
London and the University of Nottingham will also be available for testing
and distribution.
This work will include participation in
interoperability tests with vendors and users on OSINET.
.PP
We are designing modifications to the current network architecture
(analogous to the ``Streams''
concept of Bell Laboratories 9th Edition UNIX or System V.3)
to improve communication between protocol layers,
to allow more flexible layering,
to incorporate terminal and asynchronous serial I/O modules into the same
processing framework,
and to provide a more natural framework for
devices already providing virtual circuit services
(such as X.25 devices).
Such layering will provide a natural setting
for kernel-resident virtual terminal services,
and will allow direct access to communications-layer devices
for network monitoring or prototyping of new protocols.
This structure will also make it easier to tunnel one protocol through another.
Additional work may be necessary for IP
(in particular for the address resolution protocol, ARP) to allow such
revisions.
.PP
We have become members of the IEEE 1003.8 group working on a POSIX networking
interface.
We intend to introduce a proposal for a high-level protocol-independent
interface for network services suitable for distributed applications.
This interface will be based on the UNI interface proposed by Marshall Rose
[Rose88].
.NH 2
Compliance with POSIX 1003
.PP
Bringing the Berkeley UNIX kernel into compliance
with the P1003.1 POSIX interface recently approved by the IEEE
requires two major projects and many smaller ones.
The first major project is the development
of a completely new terminal driver.
The new terminal driver must have a binary-compatibility interface
to allow a transition path for programs using the old Berkeley
terminal driver.
The other major project is the development of a
POSIX session and job control implementation.
Those system utilities that create sessions and manipulate jobs must
be converted to use the new facilities.
These two projects are nearly finished, and we are completing
the conversion of the standard utility programs that are affected
by this change.
These facilities will be tested and made available to other groups
during the period covered by this proposal.
.PP
The smaller POSIX related changes that must be made
include expanded signal functionality,
restructured directory access routines,
and new set-user-identifier functionality.
Many of these interfaces will be developed as a superset
of both the POSIX and existing BSD facilities.
This work will involve coordination with other groups
intending to support both POSIX and BSD interfaces.
.PP
We intend to remain involved with the IEEE P1003.1 committee
that will work on corrections and extensions to the existing standard.
We will also continue to work actively with the 1003.2 committee
developing a shell and utilities POSIX standard.
.NH 2
Improvements to the Networking Architecture and Protocols
.PP
The networking architecture introduced in 4.2BSD
provided a framework for multiple networking protocols
using a single consistent user interface.
This framework includes three distinct layers: socket,
transport and network protocols, and network link layer.
This framework has been used for implementations of TCP/IP, Xerox NS,
the OSI protocols, and local interprocess communication.
Our experience with this framework and in performance analysis
of the existing implementations suggest some refinements to the framework
and its implementation.
One refinement is the use of structuring techniques similar to those
of the Stream I/O system, described in section 2.1,
unifying two existing interfaces.
In addition to providing additional flexibility, careful structuring
will allow improved pipelining of the network protocols using upcalls
[Clark85].
Such pipelining has been prototyped by Van Jacobson of the Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory, along with several caching strategies
that will also be incorporated.
With this work, it will be necessary to improve
communication among the levels of the system to improve performance.
In particular, the transport protocols must influence the way in which
data are buffered by higher layers for optimal performance.
We will investigate layering techniques that are both modular
and efficient, two conflicting goals.
At the same time, we will modify the current buffer management
to be more portable and to allow efficient use on machines with different
I/O architectures.
.PP
The communication mechanisms between the layers must also be extended
for robustness of the network: the transport level must be able to notify
the network and link levels of failures detected by timeouts;
the link level must be able to inform the network level of failures
that it detects, and the routing layer needs to use all this information.
.PP
The Internet and the Berkeley collection of local-area networks
have both grown at high rates in the last year.
The Bay Area Regional Research Network (BARRNet)
connects several UC campuses, Stanford and NASA-Ames with the NSF network,
increasing the complexity
of the network connectivity.
Both Internet and local routing algorithms are showing the strain
of continued growth.
We have made several changes in the local routing algorithm
to keep up with the current topology,
and are participating in the development of new routing algorithms
and protocols.
In the period covered by this proposal,
we expect to merge the current version of the Berkeley routing daemon
\fIrouted\fP with the multi-protocol daemon \fIgated\fP (which currently
supports the RIP and EGP protocols), and to update the RIP implementation
for full conformance with the recent specification [Hedrick88].
We also expect to collaborate on an implementation of a new EGP protocol,
version 3 [Lepp88]
in a \fIgated\fP framework,
and may also incorporate or collaborate on an implementation
of the SPF-based IGP protocol being developed within the Internet Engineering
Task Force.
We are continuing our involvement with that group in the evolution of standards
for the DARPA Internet.
.PP
We will review the VMTP and IP multicast support
done by David Cheriton and Steve Deering at Stanford,
evaluate the necessary changes to the system layering,
and then incorporate these modifications into the system
if the changes are found to be compatible with our goals.
.NH 2
Toward a Compatible File System Interface
.PP
The most critical shortcoming of our current UNIX system is in the
area of remote file access.
As with networking protocols,
there is no single remote file system
that provides enough speed and functionality for all problems.
It is frequently necessary to support several different remote
file system protocols, just as it is necessary to run several 
different network protocols.
The proposal currently under development
adopts the 4.3BSD calling convention for file name lookup
and allows stateful file systems,
but otherwise is closely related to Sun's virtual file system interface.
This interface has been advanced (to Sun, DEC, AT&T and others)
as a potential standard;
when the implementation is complete, we intend to explore
consensus in this area, so that file system implementations could
be as portable as device drivers.
We do not intend to develop our own remote file system protocol;
instead we will support the full semantics of existing file systems,
including the local UNIX file system
and Sun's network file system (NFS).
We are currently negotiating with several groups that have
developed their own implementations of NFS to convince them to
contribute their code to Berkeley;
we will not include NFS support unless it may be distributed with
no new licensing requirement.
We currently expect receipt of an NFS implementation from Apollo
that uses a different system interface; if feasible, we will adapt it
to our file system interface. 
.NH 2
System Security Audit
.PP
The recent invasion of the ARPANET by a quickly reproducing worm
highlighted the need for a thorough review of the access
safeguards built into the system.
Until now we have taken a passive approach to dealing with
weaknesses in the system access mechanisms, rather than actively
searching for possible weaknesses.
When we are notified of a problem or loophole in a system utility
by one of our users,
we have a well defined procedure for fixing the problem and 
expeditiously disseminating the fix to the BSD mailing list.
This procedure has proven itself to be effective in
solving known problems as they arise
(witness its success in handling the recent worm).
However, we feel that it would be useful to take a more active
role in identifying problems before they are reported (or exploited).
We will make a complete audit of the system
utilities and network servers to find unintended system access mechanisms.
Once identified, we expect that they can be corrected
through the existing mechanism.
.PP
As a part of the work to make the system more resistant to attack
from local users or via the network, it will be necessary to produce
additional documentation on the configuration and operation of the system.
This documentation will cover such topics as file and directory ownership
and access, network and server configuration,
and control of privileged operations such as file system backups.
.PP
In addition, we have been discussing possible plans for response
to emergencies such as the recent worm attack with DARPA.
We believe that a plan such as the proposed Computer Emergency Response
Team (CERT) can respond to such attacks effectively, and intend to cooperate
with such a plan.
We can provide at least two members for a response team
and can serve as the primary coordinators for problems involving BSD
UNIX and networking software.
.PP
A group within the Internet Engineering Task Force has been drafting
a Host Requirements standard for Internet hosts.
We reviewed this draft recently and joined the working group.
For the most part, the existing Berkeley TCP/IP and networking application
software conforms with the draft.
We will review conformance with the Host Requirements standard
at the same time that we review the robustness of the network software.
We expect that some additions will have to be made
to the kernel network protocols to make them compliant.
In particular, support for IP type-of-service options and routing needs
to be added, and recent proposals for gateway monitoring should be implemented
and tested.
.PP
A major shortcoming of the present system is that authentication
over the network is based solely on the privileged port mechanism
between trusting hosts and users.
Although privileged ports can only be created by processes running as root,
such processes are easy for a workstation user to obtain;
they simply reboot their workstation in single user mode.
Thus, a real authentication mechanism is needed.
At present, we believe that the MIT Kerberos authentication
server provides the best solution to this problem.
We propose to investigate Kerberos further as well as other
authentication mechanisms and then to integrate
the best one into Berkeley UNIX.
Part of this integration would be the addition of the
authentication mechanism into utilities such as
telnet, login, remote shell, etc.
MIT currently supports the use of Kerberos for authentication
of rlogin, rsh, certain other servers used at MIT, and the NFS mount
protocol.
If we choose Kerberos,
we will add support for telnet (eventually replacing rlogin),
the X window system, and the mail system within an authentication
domain (a Kerberos \fIrealm\fP).
We would also need to add support for transparent third-party operations.
(The existing Kerberos software allows a user to connect to a server
on another system without supplying a password,
but does not allow processes started on the server to access the network
without sending another password over the network.)
We hope to replace the existing password authentication on each host
with the network authentication system.
.PP
Another subject of active work, at MIT and elsewhere, is the interaction
between servers for different authentication realms.
Currently, the servers for two Kerberos realms
may be mutually authenticated only by realm administrators
with a manual exchange of keys.
We would like to add a mechanism for a user in two realms to request that
a equivalence be established
between his identities in the two realms.
Such a facility could greatly reduce the need to transmit passwords
in the clear over wide-area networks.

Milestones
.PP
The first four points outlined above are already underway.
We expect that we will have working prototypes early in 1989.
When the prototypes are moderately stable and functional,
we will produce a test release that we will distribute to
our alpha sites for testing and feedback.
If major design flaws turn up during the alpha testing,
we will reenter the development phase to resolve the problems
resulting in another test release.
Otherwise, we will incorporate feedback from the testing
and produce a revised distribution by the end of the period
covered by this proposal.
