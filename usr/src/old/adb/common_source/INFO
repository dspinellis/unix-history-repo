TYPES
	write something here.

FORMATTED OUTPUT
	Adb has a simplified, and slightly extended, version of printf,
called adbprintf().  adbprintf() conversion specifiers are introduced by
the usual `%' escape.  (Beware of SCCS eating 5 and  escapes.)  The
format of a conversion-specifier is:

	[flags] [width] [`.' precision] conversion-character

The default width is 0; the default precision is -1.  The available
flags are `-', for right adjustment within the field, and `+', which
forces a sign on numeric conversions.  If the result of a conversion
is narrower than the specified width, it is passed on the right (or
left if `-') with blanks.  If a precision is given, and is not negative,
the result of a conversion will be truncated after precision characters.
Width and precision may be given as `*', in which case they are taken
from an integer argument a la printf().

The conversion-characters, and the types they expect, are:

	[numeric]
	d	prints an hword_t value as a signed decimal integer.
	D	prints an expr_t value as a signed decimal integer.
	u	prints an hword_t value as an unsigned decimal integer.
	U	prints an expr_t value as an unsigned decimal integer.
	q	prints an hword_t value as a signed octal integer.
	Q	prints an expr_t value as a signed octal integer.
	o	prints an hword_t value as an unsigned octal integer.
	O	prints an expr_t value as an unsigned octal integer.
	z	prints an hword_t value as a signed hexadecimal integer.
	Z	prints an expr_t value as a signed hexadecimal integer.
	x	prints an hword_t value as an unsigned hexadecimal integer.
	X	prints an expr_t value as an unsigned hexadecimal integer.
	r	prints an hword_t value in the current radix.
	R	prints an expr_t value in the current radix.
	v	prints an hword_t value in signed variant of current radix.
	V	prints an expr_t value in signed variant of current radix.

	[non-numeric]
	c	prints a character.

	s	prints a string.

	m	prints nothing; hence %<width>m prints <width> spaces.

	t	prints nothing, but adjusts the width such that it
		becomes a tabstop.  Thus %24t moves to the next column
		that is a multiple of 24, and %8t acts like \t would
		if \t were implemented in adb.

	[special]
	?	converts an integer value, then applies a second
		conversion-specifier.  If integer was zero, the
		output from the second conversion-specifier is
		suppressed.  For instance, %?s converts one integer
		and one string, and prints the string only if the
		integer is nonzero (and the pointer is not evaluated).
		Thus `adbprintf("%?s", s!=NULL, s)' prints the string
		s if and only if the pointer s is not NULL.  `?'
		conversions may be nested: ("%??x", a, b, c) prints
		c only if both a and b are nonzero.
