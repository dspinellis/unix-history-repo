.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Roffbib
is a shell script which prints out all records in a bibliographic database,
in bibliography format rather than as footnotes or endnotes.
Generally it is used in conjunction with
.Xr sortbib  :
.Pp
.Dl sortbib  database \&| roffbib
.Pp
.Nm Roffbib
accepts most of the options understood by
.Xr nroff  1  ,
such as the
.Fl T
flag to specify terminal type.
.Pp
If abstracts or comments are entered in the database following the %X field key,
.Nm roffbib
will format them into paragraphs for an annotated bibliography.
Several %X fields may be given if several
annotation paragraphs are desired.
.Pp
Options exclusive to
.Nm roffbib :
.Tp Fl x
Suppresses the printing of %X abstracts.
.Tp Fl V
Send output to the Versatec (use vtroff).
.Tp Fl Q
Queue the output to the default troff device.
.Tp
.Pp
If neither the
.Fl Q
or
.Fl V
flags are given,
.Nm
sends the output to the standard output.
The default macros for
.Nm
are in 
.Pa /usr/share/tmac/tmac.bib .
These can be over ridden by
specifying a user-defined set with the
.Fl m
option.
.Pp
Four command-line registers control formatting style
of the bibliography, much like the number registers of
.Xr ms  7  .
The command-line argument
.Cx Fl r
.Ar N1
.Cx
will number
the references starting at one  1 .
The flag
.Cx Fl r
.Ar V2
.Cx
will double space the biblio\%graphy,
while
.Cx Fl r
.Ar V1
.Cx
will double space references
but single space annotation paragraphs.
The line length can be changed from the default 6.5 inches
to 6 inches with the
.Cx Fl r
.Ar L6i
.Cx
argument,
and the page offset can be set from the default of 0
to one inch by specifying
.Cx Fl r
.Ar O1i
.Cx
(capital O, not zero).
Note: with the
.Fl V
and
.Fl Q
flags
the default page offset is already one inch.
.Pp
.Nm Roffbib
is limited, but it is a good script to copy and adopt
for one's own needs, as it does demonstrate usage of
.Xr refer 1 .
