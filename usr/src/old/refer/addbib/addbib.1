.Sh NAME
.Nm addbib
.Nd create or extend bibliographic database
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm addbib
.Op Fl a
.Op Fl p Ar promptfile
.Ar database
.Sh DESCRIPTION
When this program starts up, answering
.Ql y
to the initial
.Ql Instructions?
prompt yields directions;
typing
.Ql n
or
.Ql RETURN
skips them.
.Nm Addbib
then prompts for various bibliographic fields,
reads responses from the terminal,
and sends output records to a
.Ar database .
A null response (just
.Ql RETURN )
means to leave out that field.
A minus sign
.Ql \-
means to go back to the previous field.
A trailing backslash allows a field to be continued on the next line.
The repeating
.Ql Continue?
prompt allows the user
either to resume by typing
.Ql y
or
.Ql RETURN ,
to quit the current session by typing
.Ql n
or
.Ql q ,
or to edit the
.Ar database
with any system editor (.e.g.
.Xr vi ,
.Xr ex ,
.Xr edit ,
.Xr ed ) .
.Pp
Options avilable:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl a
The
.Fl a
option suppresses prompting for an abstract;
asking for an abstract is the default.
Abstracts are ended with a
.Ql CTRL-d .
.It Fl p
The
.Fl p
option causes
.Nm addbib
to use a new prompting skeleton, defined in
.Ar promptfile .
This file should contain prompt strings, a tab,
and the key-letters to be written to the
.Ar database .
.El
.Pp
The most common key-letters and their meanings are given below.
.Nm Addbib
insulates you from these key-letters,
since it gives you prompts in English,
but if you edit the bibliography file later on,
you will need to know this information.
