	@(#)DEBUGS	5.1 (Berkeley) %G%

WHAT THE DEBUG FLAGS MEAN:

Debug flags preceded with an X are first pass flags; the rest are
second pass flags.

-Xa:	Print the actions taken for each operator as parse trees are
	assembled, from buildtree().

-Xb:	Extra information from buildtree() on parse tree assembly.  May
	be used to increase the information from -Xa.

-Xd:	Print information about declarations, from many places in pftn.c.
	May be repeated to get still more information.

-Xi:	Information about initializations, from several places in pftn.c.

-a:	From rallo(), print the address of the tree being worked on for
	the purpose of allocating registers, and indicate what this
	tree's requirements have been determined to be.

-e:	Print the expression tree at useful places, e.g. when an
	expression appears in the intermediate code file as a
	statement, or just before store() is called in codgen().

-l:	Print line number and file name at the end of every statement.

-o:	Print the expression tree when order() is called, and whenever
	the loop in order() takes us to the top after a rewrite.  Also
	prints the tree with extra info when a rewrite is forced due
	lack of a matching template.

-r:	Identify the register being worked on and what's in it and
	sometimes why it's being worked on, from rfree(), rbusy() and
	reclaim().

-s:	From tshape(), print the address of the given node and the
	shape that it's being tested against.  The opcode for the node
	is also printed.

-t:	From ttype(), print the node type and the type template which
	the node is being tested against.

-u:	Previously used to debug the Sethi-Ullman algorithm, currently
	defunct.

-v:	Report on multi-level tree matching.  Very verbose.

-x:	Prints intermediate code instructions in mainp2(); also used to
	debug zzzcode(), the routine that does specialized template
	interpretation.
