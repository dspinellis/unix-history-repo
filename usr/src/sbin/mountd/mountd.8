.SH NAME
mountd \- service remote NFS mount requests
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /sbin/mountd
[
.B \-n
]
[
exportsfile
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mountd
is the server for
.SM NFS
mount requests from other client machines.
.I Mountd
listens for service requests at the port indicated in the
.SM NFS
server specification; see
``Network File System Protocol Specification, RFC1094''.
The \fB\-n\fR option allows non-root mount requests to be served.
This should only be specified if there are clients such as PC's,
that require it.
The \fBexportsfile\fR argument specifies an alternate location
for the exports file.
Sending a SIGHUP signal to
.I mountd
will cause it to reread its exports file.
.SH FILES
/etc/exports
