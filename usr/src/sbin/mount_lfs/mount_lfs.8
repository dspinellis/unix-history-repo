.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_lfs
.Nd mount a log-structured file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mount_lfs
.Op Fl dns
.Op Fl F fsoptions
.Pa device
.Pa mount_point
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm mount_lfs
command attaches the log-structured file system
residing on the device named by
.Ar device
to the global file system namespace.
The file system is attached at the point
specified by
.Ar mount_point .
This command is normally executed by
.Xr mount 8
at boot time.
.Pp
After the file system is mounted, if the
.Fl n
flag is not specified then the
.Xr lfs_cleanerd 8
program is invoked to clean the file system periodically.
If the
.Fl d
or
.Fl s
flags are given to
.Nm mount_lfs ,
they are passed to the cleaner.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mount 2 ,
.Xr unmount 2 ,
.Xr fstab 5 ,
.Xr lfs_cleanerd 8
.Sh CAVEATS
.Nm Mount_lfs
can be run by hand if you wish to use
the flags, and since the flags are useful
mainly for debugging this doesn't make much
of a difference in normal operation.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm mount_lfs
function first appeared in 4.4BSD.
