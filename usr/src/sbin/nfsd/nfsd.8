.SH NAME
nfsd \- remote NFS server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /sbin/nfsd
[
.B \-u
.I msk,mtch,numprocs
]
[
.B \-t
.I msk,mtch,hostadr1,hostadr2,...
]
[
.I numprocs
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Nfsd
runs on a server machine to service
.SM NFS
requests from client machines.
At least one
.I nfsd
must be running for a machine to operate as a server.
The options
.B \-u
and
.B \-t
are used to indicate which transport protocols are to be served.
.TP
.B \-u
Serve UDP NFS clients.
.TP
.B \-t
Serve TCP NFS clients.
.TP
.I "msk, mtch"
These arguments permit restriction of NFS services
to a subset of the host addresses. The
.I msk
and
.I mtch
are applied to the client host address as follows:
.sp
if ((
.I host_address
&
.I msk
) ==
.I mtch
)
.br
   - service the client request
.br
else
.br
   - drop the request
.TP
.I hostadr1,...
You may also specify zero or more specific host addresses to be accepted
as well as ones that pass the
.I msk, mtch
test above.
This may only be done for transport protocols that are connection based, such
as TCP.
For the internet domain,
.I msk, mtch
and
.I hostadrs'
are specified in internet
.I dot
notation.
.TP
.I numprocs
Specifies how many servers to fork off. This may only be specified for
non-connection based protocols such as UDP.
.LP
If neither
.I \-u
or
.I \-t
are specified,
.I numprocs
servers for UDP accepting requests from all clients are started.
If
.I numprocs
is not specified, it defaults to 1.
.LP
For example:
.sp
/sbin/nfsd \-u 255.255.255.0,131.104.48.0,4 \-t 255.255.0.0,131.104.0.0,131.102.31.2
.IP "- "
Serves UDP and TCP transports. For UDP,
it runs 4 daemons that accept requests
from any client on subnet 131.104.48.
For TCP, it accepts connections from any client on network 131.104
plus the client with the address 131.102.31.2.
.LP
/sbin/nfsd \-u 255.255.240.0,131.104.0.0,6 \-t 0,0
.IP "- "
Serves UDP and TCP transports.
For UDP, it runs 6 daemons that accept requests from clients with
addresses in the range 131.104.0.x - 131.104.15.x.
For TCP, it accepts connections from any client.
.LP
/sbin/nfsd \-u 0,0,4
.IP "- "
Serves any UDP client with 4 servers, only.
.LP
/sbin/nfsd 4
.IP "- "
Serves any UDP client with 4 servers, only. (Compatibility)
.LP
A server should typically run enough daemons to handle
the maximum level of concurrency from its clients,
typically four to six.
.PP
.I Nfsd
listens for service requests at the port indicated in the
.SM NFS
server specification; see
``Network File System Protocol Specification, RFC1094''
.SH SEE ALSO
.IR nfsstat (1),
.IR nfssvc (2),
.IR mountd (8),
.IR portmap (8)
.SH BUGS
The client host address restrictions specified here are unrelated to
the mount restrictions specified in /etc/exports for
.IR mountd (8).
