.se "Mail to Notesfiles"

	Some mailers  (like 4.2 BSD's \fIsendmail\fP)
allow mail to be directed to specific programs.
The nfmail program facilitates sending mail to notesfiles.
The subject line of the mailed letter is extracted and used as the
title of the note.
Nfmail extracts the author's name and system
from the body of the letter.
Subject lines are examined for ``Re:'' prefixes and, if they
exist, are used in an attempt to link the letter as a reply to
an existing base note.

	To send mail addressed to ``somenotes'' 
to the notesfile ``somenotes'' with the 4.1 Bsd /etc/delivermail
add the following line to the file /usr/lib/aliases.
The second line shows the general format for /usr/lib/aliases entries
which feed a notesfile.
If the Notesfile utilities are stored in a different directory, the
path name should be changed appropriately.
