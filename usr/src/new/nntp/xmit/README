[This is a fairly old (but hardy!) version of nntpxmit.  Erik Fair has
promised a newer version with more features "soon".  -- Phil, 15 Oct 87]

     The program "nntpxmit" is an active trnamission client
(see the comment in nntpxmit.c for a description of the
difference between active and passive clients) written by Erik Fair
<fair@ucbvax.berkeley.edu, ...!ucbvax!fair>.

     nntpxmit requires support from the 2.11 news source.
Because of this, it must be compiled in the "src" directory of
the 2.11 distribution.  You should:

     1. Move the *.c and *.h files to 2.11/src

     2. Move ../common/response_codes.h into 2.11/src

     3. Add the lines in the Makefile in this directory to the
	2.11/src Makefile.  You can just cat the Makefile
	here to the Makefile in the 2.11/src directory, if
	you'd like.

     4. Then do "make nntpxmit".

     Having compiled nntpxmit like that, you need to set your news
system up to use it.  Nntpxmit takes as arguments an internet host
to connect to, and a file containing a list of articles to send to
it.

     So, you might edit your news sys file to have an entry like:

#
# NASA Ames Research Center
#
nike:ucb,uc,mod,to.nike:F:/usr/spool/news/batch/ames-titan.arpa

This will place names of news articles in the ucb, uc, and mod newsgroups
in the file "/usr/spool/news/batch/ames-titan.arpa".  This is because
we assume the output batch file will be the machine's internet name.

Periodically, you should have crontab run "nntpsend" to transmit
the news.  A good choice for "periodically" is every 10 minutes.
nntpsend depends on the program "shlock", which you'll need to
compile by hand (horrors):

	cc -O -o shlock shlock.c

Also, nntpsend will need to be customized for your system.
Fortunately, it's pretty straightforward.

     nntpxmit has an option "-s" which *supresses* statistic
logging via syslog.  Additionally, the "-d" option is availible
for debugging.

     Please forward comments/suggestions for improvement/bugs to
Erik Fair, <fair@ucbvax.berkeley.edu>.

     [My thanks extended to Erik for writing nntpxmit, shlock,
and the stats scripts.  My thanks also to Mel Pleasant
<pleasant@topaz.rutgers.edu> for the nntpsend script.  --Phil]
