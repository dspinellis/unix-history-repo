.TH NEWSRC 5 "28 July 1983"
.UC 4
.SH NAME
newsrc \- information file for readnews(1) and checknews(1)
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I .newsrc
file contains the list of previously read articles and an optional
options line for
.IR readnews(1) " and " checknews(1).
Each newsgroup that articles
have been read from has a line of the form:
.LP
.I newsgroup: range
.LP
The
.I range
is a list of the articles read.  It is basically a list of no.'s
separated by commas with sequential no.'s collapsed with hyphens.
For instance:
.LP
.B general: 1-78,80,85-90
.br
.B fa.info-cpm: 1-7
.br
.B net.news: 1
.br
.B fa.info-vax! 1-5
.br
.LP
If the : is replaced with an ! (as in info-vax above) the newsgroup
is not subscribed to and will not be shown to the user.
.LP
An options line starts with the word
.B options
(left-justified).  Then there are the list of options just as they
would be on the command line.  For instance:
.LP
.B "options \-n all !fa.sf-lovers !fa.human-nets \-r"
.br
.B "options \-c \-r"
.LP
A string of lines beginning with a space or tab after the initial options
line will be considered continuation lines.
