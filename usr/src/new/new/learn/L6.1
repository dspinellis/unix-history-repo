	    Misc. Useful Features - Advanced Insert Mode

   There are a few things which you can do in insert mode which we didn't
talk about before.  For example, you probably noticed that you can use the
backspace key to backup.  You can also use your 'kill' character (usually @,
but often reset to ^X or ^U) to back up over everything you've inserted on
that line.  If for some reason you need to insert a control character into
your file, just prefix a ^V to it.  For example, typing '^V^H' will insert a
backspace character (^H), instead of erasing the preceeding character.  Lastly,
you can use ^W to backspace over a whole word at once.
   Another commonly-useful insert feature is auto-indent mode.  This feature
makes vi automatically indent each new line the same amount as the previous
line.  This is highly convenient when typing programs and indented paragraphs
and tables.  To turn this feature on, type ':set autoindent' or ':set ai'.
Once this is on, if you want to move backwards beyond the indent, you'll need
to use the ^D command, standing for 'detab'.  This is different from the ^D
command which scrolls in that this one is only useful while you're in insert
mode.
   Type 'ready' to try out autoindenting and the other insert-mode features.

   A summary of the commands usable with insert mode:
		backspace = Just that
	   kill character = Backspace over whole line (usually @ or ^X or ^U)
		       ^V = To insert a control character
		       ^W = Backspace over the last word
	:set autoindent
	       or	  = Turn on autoindenting
	   :set ai

	:set noautoindent
	       or	  = Turn off autoindenting
	   :set noai

		   ^D  ^T = Move backwards or forwards one shiftwidth

Except for the :set commands, all of these only work while you're in insert
mode.  Experiment with them, especially the ^D and ^T commands with
autoindenting turned on.
