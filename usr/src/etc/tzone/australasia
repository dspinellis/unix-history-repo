#	I am including a description of Australian time zones. . .
#	this stuff is definitely accurate.
#	. . .
#	a) Australian Eastern Time: (EST = GMT+10:00, EDT = GMT+11:00)
#	. . .
#	Summer of 86/87 - present (current legislation):
#		third Sun Oct 02:00 EST -> third LSun Mar 02:00 EST
#
# If this turns out to be true, substitute Sun<=21 (third Sunday in October)
# for Sun<=24 (next-to-last Sunday in October) above. . .some time before
# October 1988, the first time it makes a difference.
