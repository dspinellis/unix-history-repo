		   else we have come across a name which has no RRs
		   associated with it because it is just a place holder
		   (e.g., EDU).  In the former case, we would like to delete
		   the namebuf, since it is no longer of use, but in the
		   latter case we need to hold on to it, so future lookups

		   names are added, and can never shrink back down completely
		   when all their associated RRs are deleted). */
