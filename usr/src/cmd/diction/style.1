.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Style
analyzes the surface characteristics of the writing style
of a document.
It reports on readability, sentence length and
structure, word length and usage, verb type, and sentence openers.
Because
.I style
runs
.I deroff
before looking at the text, formatting
header files should be included as part of the input.
The default macro package
.B \-ms
may be overridden with the flag
.B \-mm.
The flag
.BR \-ml ,
which causes 
.B deroff
to skip lists, should be used if the document contains many lists of
non-sentences.
The other options are used to locate sentences with certain characteristics.
