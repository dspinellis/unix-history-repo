.SH NAME
.I Vdformat
\- Format disk media and / or relocate bad sectors on drives attached
to VDDC disk controllers.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBVDFORMAT\fP can be used to format disk drives, relocate
known flawed sectors, verify disk surfaces, print seek profile graphs
for disk drives, exercise disk drives, and perform general disk drive
maintenance procedures.
.PP
VDFORMAT keeps track of all known flaws by placing their addresses in a
\fBbad sector map\fP on the last cylinder of each disk drive.  This information
is used during subsequent formatter operations to keep all known
bad sectors correctly relocated.
.PP
Flaw addresses are loaded into the bad sector map in four ways.
The first is by
reading the manufacturer's flaw map directly from the disk surface.
The second is by automatically adding any new flaws found during verify
operations.  The third is by direct operator entry.  The fourth
is by reading the
entire disk surface once and taking note of any errors or relocations
found during the reads.
.PP
.SH Command overview
.PP
The following basic commands are \fIalways\fP
available, even when long formatting
operations are underway:
.PP

.fi
.SH Status
.PP
The \fBStatus\fP command may be typed in at any time to determine the
status of the formatter.  The status message will explain
what the formatter is waiting for,
the current operation, and a progress report
if the formatter is busy. 
.nf

\fIExample\fP

   Starting format on controller 0, drive 1, drive type is FSD.

     \fBHelp\fP
           The following commands are available:
                   Status - Display current state of formatter.

     \fBStatus\fP
            Formatting on controller 0, drive 1, drive type is FSD.
            Inspecting disk to determine current state.
            Currently inspecting cylinder 120, track 10, sector 15.

   Formatting completed successfully.
.fi
.SH Kill
.PP
The \fBKill\fP command may be used to stop operations that are in 
progress already.  \fBKill\fP will always have meaning, may
be issued at any time, and will always leave disks in a consistent state.
.SH Specifying operations
.PP
Formatter operations are broken into two phases: entry
and execution.  
.PP
During the entry phase the operator enters all the
disk operations that he / she wants to execute during the execution
phase.  After the operation list is entered correctly the operator
issues the start command and execution begins.
.PP
The execution phase executes all commands specified during the entry phase
on the specified disks.  These commands are accumulated and executed
later because each operation may require up to several hours to complete.
By deferring operations, \fBVDFORMAT\fP frees the operator to do other
work during this time period.
.PP
The commands that are detailed in this section
are grouped according to the immediacy of their
actions.  Commands such as \fBDelete\fP and \fBReset\fP,
which will execute the moment they are
keyed into the system, are termed immediate commands.
Commands which
effect after the \fBStart\fP command is issued
are termed deferred commands.
.SH Immediate commands
.PP
Instead of forcing the operator to specify one operation on one drive
at a time,
comma separated lists and dash separated ranges can
be entered for operations, controller
numbers, and drive numbers.
Please refer to examples.
.SH List operation
.PP
The \fBList\fP operation displays all commands that
were keyed in by the operator and are ready to
be executed when the \fBStart\fP command is issued.
.nf

\fIExample\fP

   Operation? \fBList\fP
     The following operations will occur when Start is issued:

     Format on Controller 0, drive 1, type FSD.
     Format on Controller 0, drive 2, type XFD.
     Format on Controller 0, drive 3, type XFD.
     Relocate on Controller 0, drive 0, type FSD.
.fi
.SH Delete operation
.PP
Delete is intended to provide a simple editing facility for command
lists.  Between the \fBDelete\fP operation and the ability to add more
operations to the operation list, Any error in the operation list
can be corrected.
.PP
When the delete operation is specified, a numbered list of operations
is printed on the console and \fBVDFORMAT\fP will repeatedly
ask for line numbers to delete.
.PP
Line numbering for the \fBDelete\fP operation will remain the same
even after a line is deleted.  This is done to avoid confusion, but
it implies that the same line can be deleted multiple times.  This
presents no problems for the formatter and no error will be returned
if this is done.
.PP
The \fBDelete\fP prompt level is terminated by entering 'Quit'
(or the \fBKill\fP command) as shown in the following example:
.nf

\fIExample\fP

   Operation? \fBDelete\fP
       1)  Format on Controller 0, drive 1, type FSD.
       2)  Format on Controller 0, drive 2, type XFD.
       3)  Format on Controller 0, drive 3, type XFD.
       4)  Format on Controller 1, drive 0, type XSD.
       5)  Format on Controller 1, drive 1, type XSD.
       6)  Format on Controller 1, drive 2, type XSD.
       7)  Format on Controller 1, drive 3, type XSD.
       8)  Relocate on Controller 0, drive 0, type FSD.

     Delete line? \fB2\fP
           2) Format using Controller 0, drive 2, type FSD has been deleted.
     Delete line? \fB8\fP
           8) Relocate using Controller 0, drive 0, type FSD has been deleted.
     Delete line? \fBQuit\fP

   Operation?

.fi
.SH Reset operation
.PP
The \fBReset\fP operation clears all commands keyed in so far
and executes internal consistency checks for the
formatter.  The main use is to quickly delete all operations, 
and reset internal state.
The operator who really messed up the command sequence can start
again from the top.
.nf

\fIExample\fP

   Operation? \fBReset\fP
     Reset the world.  Are you sure? \fBYes\fP

     All operations specified have been deleted.

.SH Start operations

that was typed in by the operator.  The operator should be sure
that all commands are correct before proceeding.

This includes which
sectors were bad, to what sector they were relocated, 
how were the errors detected, and
the current format state.

     cyl 293, head 3, pos 19590, len 1 (Sector #93887) -> sector 261762.
   Information display completed successfully.
.fi
.SH Format operation
.PP
The \fBformat\fP operation will read
the flaw map information directly from the drives and use that information to
map out all flaws after formatting the drive's surface.
.PP
After formatting the drive's surface the drive surface is verified using
the number of patterns requested by the operator.  The number of patterns 
may range from 0 to 16.  It is suggested that at least one pattern be used
so potential drive problems are more likely to be found before real information
is written on the drives.
.PP

.fi
.SH Verify operation
.PP
The verify  operation can be used to check for new flaws on a disk
that currently has data
on it.  This is accomplished by
writing the necessary patterns on the drive's surface, reading the information
back, and comparing the results to  the original pattern.
If a flaw is found
the sector is relocated immediately.
Each new flaw will be relocated and permanently
added to the bad sector map.

.SH Relocate operation
.PP
The operator has the ability to manually type in known flaws
using the CDC flaw map format, UNIX file-system / block numbers,
absolute sector numbers, and absolute track numbers.
.PP
\fBVDFORMAT\fP will automatically switch back and forth between
the various forms of inputing flaw addresses
by looking at the first character on any
line.  If the first character is between 'a' and 'h' then
it is assumed that the character is a file system name and the
next input will be the actual UNIX block number, if the first character is 
an 's' then sector numbers are entered, if the first character is an 't'
then track numbers are entered, otherwise
flaw map format is assumed.

The profile operation is used to print a graph of seek time verses seek

a star ('*') or a plus ('+') to indicate which direction the point
was rounded.  The star shows that the point was rounded up, and the plus
shows rounding down has taken place.
