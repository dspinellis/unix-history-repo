or appended to
.IR file
if the
.B \-a
option is given.
It can be sent to the line printer later with
.IR lpr .

is saved in the file
.IR typescript .

This program is useful when using a crt and a hard-copy
record of the dialog is desired, as for a student handing
in a program that was developed on a crt when hard-copy
terminals are in short supply.
.SH BUGS
.I Script
places 
.B everything
in the log file.  This is not what the naive user expects.
