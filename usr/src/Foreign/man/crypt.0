     The crypt function performs password encryption.  It is derived from the
     NBS Data Encryption Standard.  Additional code has been added to deter
     key search attempts.  The first argument to ccrryypptt is a NUL-terminated
     string (normally a password typed by a user).  The second is a character
     array, 9 bytes in length, consisting of an underscore (``_'') followed by
     4 bytes of iteration count and 4 bytes of salt.  Both the iteration _c_o_u_n_t
     and the _s_a_l_t are encoded with 6 bits per character, least significant
     bits first.  The values 0 to 63 are encoded by the characters ``./0-9A-
     Za-z'', respectively.

     The _s_a_l_t is used to induce disorder in to the DES algorithm in one of
     16777216 possible ways (specifically, if bit _i of the _s_a_l_t is set then
     bits _i and _i_+_2_4 are swapped in the DES ``E'' box output).  The _k_e_y is di-
     vided into groups of 8 characters (a short final group is null-padded)
     and the low-order 7 bits of each each character (56 bits per group) are
     used to form the DES key as follows: the first group of 56 bits becomes
     the initial DES key.  For each additional group, the XOR of the group
     bits and the encryption of the DES key with itself becomes the next DES
     key.  Then the final DES key is used to perform _c_o_u_n_t cumulative encryp-
     tions of a 64-bit constant.  The value returned is a NUL-terminated
     string, 20 bytes in length, consisting of the _s_e_t_t_i_n_g followed by the en-
     coded 64-bit encryption.

     For compatibility with historical versions of crypt(3),  the _s_e_t_t_i_n_g may
     consist of 2 bytes of salt, encoded as above, in which case an iteration
     _c_o_u_n_t of 25 is used, fewer perturbations of DES are available, at most 8
     characters of _k_e_y are used, and the returned value is a NUL-terminated
     string 13 bytes in length.

     The functions, eennccrryypptt(), sseettkkeeyy(), ddeess__sseettkkeeyy() and ddeess__cciipphheerr() allow
     limited access to the DES algorithm itself.  The _k_e_y argument to sseettkkeeyy()
     is a 64 character array of binary values (numeric 0 or 1).  A 56-bit key
     is derived from this array by dividing the array into groups of 8 and ig-
     noring the last bit in each group.

     The eennccrryypptt() argument _b_l_o_c_k is also a 64 character array of binary val-
     ues.  If the value of _f_l_a_g is 0, the argument _b_l_o_c_k is encrypted, other-
     wise it fails.  The encryption is returned in the original array _b_l_o_c_k
     after using the key specified by sseettkkeeyy() to process it.

     The ddeess__sseettkkeeyy() and ddeess__cciipphheerr() functions are faster but less portable
     than sseettkkeeyy() and eennccrryypptt().  The argument to ddeess__sseettkkeeyy() is a character
     array of length 8.  The _l_e_a_s_t significant bit in each character is ig-
     nored and the next 7 bits of each character are concatenated to yield a
     56-bit key.  The function ddeess__cciipphheerr() encrypts the 64-bits stored in the
     8 characters at _i_n using abs(3) of _c_o_u_n_t iterations of DES and stores the
     64-bit result in the 8 characters at _o_u_t. The _s_a_l_t specifies perturba-
     tions to DES as described above.

     The function ccrryypptt() returns a pointer to the encrypted value on success
     and NULL on failure.  The functions sseettkkeeyy(), eennccrryypptt(), ddeess__sseettkkeeyy(),
     and ddeess__cciipphheerr() return 0 on success and 1 on failure.  Historically, the
     functions sseettkkeeyy() and eennccrryypptt() did not return any value.  They have
     been provided return values primarily to distinguish implementations
     where hardware support is provided but not available or where the DES en-
     cryption is not available due to the usual political silliness.

     A rotor-based ccrryypptt() function appeared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.  The cur-
     rent style ccrryypptt() first appeared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX.

     Dropping the _l_e_a_s_t significant bit in each character of the argument to
     ddeess__sseettkkeeyy() is ridiculous.

     The ccrryypptt() function leaves its result in an internal static object and
     returns a pointer to that object.  Subsequent calls to ccrryypptt() will modi-
     fy the same object.
