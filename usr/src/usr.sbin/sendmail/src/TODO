(Version 8.3 of %G%)

*****	Database (keyed lookup) locking and rebuild.

****	8 -> 7 bit MIME conversion.

***	NIS support for aliases.

***	cf/cf/Makefile.dist

**	Handle Expires: header field (if still in queue).

**	Find a good test suite and include in the distribution.

*	WIN/3B support (non-atomic rename, no h_addr_list, others?)
	(Bruce Lilly <blilly!bruce@uu.psi.com>)

*	Sun YBTS daemon uses -ba.  [Martin Kiff <MGK@newton.npl.co.uk>]

*	EXPN adds @domain to all mailers, including prog.  Is this right?
	[Bob Henry]

*	EXPN adds @localhost instead of @$M.  [Pel Emanuelsson]

**	[AEJ] You can use symbolic links to point into protected directories.

*	Change body put code to time out around individual puts.  This will
	make the timeout algorithm more responsive and more resilient.
	Unfortunately, it's also a pain in the butt.

***	Dynamically allocate MAXNAME buffers for headers.

***	Should have new mailer flags to override LocalMailer stuff:
	- M_ALIASABLE (A) -- can use as the LHS of an alias.
	- M_HASPWENT (w) -- should have a /etc/passwd entry.  If not found
	  there, implies user unknown.  Also implies .forward and UDB
	  searching, search for |, /, and :include:, etc.).
	- Actually, UDB searching and |, /, and :include: mapping should
	  probably be on another flag.  (Cannot be 'l' for back compat
	  reasons.)
	- Need for $@host part of triple and Return-Receipt-To: processing
	  should also be split apart.

*	Some way to relay unfound local users to another site.

*	Disable all default RW sets except mailer-specific?

**	Extend OI to allow separate settings for canonification, MX, and A
	lookups.

**	Add $!x class to match any number of words not in class x [KRE].

****	Change NoReturn to be an envelope flag.

****	Add M_NOLOOPBACKCHK (k) mailer flag to turn off check of name in
	HELO command.

***	Add ability to disable Return-Receipt-To: on a privacy flag.
