.pp
.i Sendmail
implements a general purpose internetwork mail routing facility
under the UNIX*
.(f
*UNIX is a trademark of Bell Laboratories.
.)f
operating system.
It is not tied to any one transport protocol \*-
its function may be likened to a crossbar switch,
relaying messages from one domain into another.
In the process,
it can do a limited amount of message header editing
to put the message into a format that is appropriate
for the receiving domain.
All of this is done under the control of a configuration file.
.pp
Due to the requirements of flexibility
for
.i sendmail ,
the configuration file can seem somewhat unapproachable.
However, there are only a few basic configurations
for most sites,
for which standard configuration files have been supplied.
Most other configurations
can be built by adjusting an existing configuration files
incrementally.
.pp
.i Sendmail
is based on
RFC822 (Internet Mail Format Protocol),
RFC821 (Simple Mail Transport Protocol),
and
RFC1123 (Internet Host Requirements).
However, since
.i sendmail
is designed to work in a wider world,
in many cases it can be configured to exceed these protocols.
These cases are described herein.
.pp
Although
.i sendmail
is intended to run
without the need for monitoring,
it has a number of features
that may be used to monitor or adjust the operation
under unusual circumstances.
These features are described.
.pp
Section one describes how to do a basic
.i sendmail
installation.
Section two
explains the day-to-day information you should know
to maintain your mail system.
If you have a relatively normal site,
these two sections should contain sufficient information
for you to install
.i sendmail
and keep it happy.
Section three
describes some parameters that may be safely tweaked.
Section four
has information regarding the command line arguments.
Section five
contains the nitty-gritty information about the configuration
file.
This section is for masochists
and people who must write their own configuration file.
Section six
gives a brief description of differences
in this version of
.i sendmail .
The appendixes give a brief
but detailed explanation of a number of features
not described in the rest of the paper.
.sh 1 "BASIC INSTALLATION"
.pp
.i
This section is a very rough rewrite;
please don't assume that it is already completely correct.
However,
please send me suggestions so that later versions of this document
can be more accurate.
.pp
There are two basic steps to installing sendmail.
The hard part is to build the configuration table.
This is a file that sendmail reads when it starts up
that describes the mailers it knows about,
how to parse addresses,
how to rewrite the message header,
and the settings of various options.
Although the configuration table is quite complex,
a configuration can usually be built
by adjusting an existing off-the-shelf configuration.
The second part is actually doing the installation,
i.e., creating the necessary files, etc.
.pp
The remainder of this section will describe the installation of sendmail
assuming you can use one of the existing configurations
and that the standard installation parameters are acceptable.
All pathnames and examples
are given from the root of the
.i sendmail
subtree,
normally
.i /usr/src/usr.\*(SD/sendmail
on 4.3BSD.
.pp
If you are loading this off the tape,
continue with the next session.
If you have a running binary already on your system,
you should probably skip to section 1.2.
.sh 2 "Compiling Sendmail"
.pp
All sendmail source is in the
.i src
subdirectory.
If you are running on a 4.4BSD system,
compile by typing
.q make .
On other systems, you may have to make some other adjustments.
.sh 3 "Old versions of make"
.pp
If you are not running the new version of
.b make
you will probably have to use
.(b
make \-f Makefile.dist
.)b
This file does not assume several new syntaxes,
including the
.q +=
syntax in macro definition
and the
.q ".include"
syntax.
.sh 3 "Compilation flags"
.pp
.i Sendmail
supports three different formats
for the
.i aliases
database.
These formats are:
.nr ii 1i
.ip DBM
The old, tried and somewhat-true
.i dbm
library from V7.
Try to avoid this.
.ip NDBM
A newer version of the above.
This was the preferred format prior to 4.4BSD.
It allows such complex things as multiple databases
and closing a currently open database.
.ip NEWDB
The new database package from Berkeley.
If you have this, use it.
It allows
long records,
multiple open databases,
real in-memory caching,
and so forth.
You can define this in conjunction with one of the other two;
if you do,
old databases are read,
but when a new database is created it will be in NEWDB format.
As a nasty hack,
if you have both NEWDB and one of the DB formats defined,
and if the file
.i /var/yp/Makefile
exists and is readable,
.i sendmail
will create both new and old versions of the alias file
during a
.i newalias
command.
This is required because the Sun NIS/YP system
reads the DBM version of the alias file.
It's ugly as sin,
but it works.
.lp
If none of these are defined,
.i sendmail
reads the alias file into memory on every invocation.
This can be slow and should be avoided.
.pp
System V based systems can define
SYSTEM5
to make several small adjustments.
This changes the handling of timezones
and uses the much less efficient
.i lockf
call in preference to
.i flock .
These can be specified separately using the compilation flags
SYS5TZ
and
LOCKF
respectively.
.pp
If you don't have the
.i unsetenv
routine in your system library, define the UNSETENV compilation flag.
.pp
You may also have to define the compilation variable LA_TYPE
to describe how your load average is computed.
This is described in detail in section 6.1.
.sh 3 "Compilation and installation"
.pp
After making the local system configuration described above,
You should be able to compile and install the system.
Compilation can be performed using
.q make\**
.(f
\**where you may have to replace
.q make
with
.q "make \-f Makefile.dist"
as appropriate.
.)f
in the
.b sendmail/src
directory.
You may be able to install using
.(b
make install
.)b
This should install the binary in
/usr/\*(SD
and create links from
/usr/bin/newaliases
and
/usr/bin/mailq
to
/usr/\*(SD/sendmail.
On BSD4.4 systems it will also format and install man pages.
.sh 2 "Configuration Files"
.pp
.i Sendmail
cannot operate without a configuration file.
The configuration defines the mail systems understood at this site,
how to access them,
how to forward email to remote mail systems,
and a number of tuning parameters.
This configuration file is detailed
in the later portion of this document.
.pp
The
.i sendmail
configuration can be daunting at first.
The world is complex,
and the mail configuration reflects that.
The distribution includes an m4-based configuration package
that hides a lot of the complexity.
.pp
These configuration files are simpler than old versions
largely because the world has become simpler;
in particular,
text-based host files are officially eliminated,
obviating the need to
.q hide
hosts behind a registered internet gateway.
.pp
These files also assume that most of your neighbors
use domain-based UUCP addressing;
that is,
instead of naming hosts as
.q host!user
they will use
.q host.domain!user .
The configuration files can be customized to work around this,
but it is more complex.
.pp
I haven't tested these yet on an isolated LAN environment
with a single UUCP connection to the outside world.
If you are in such an environment,
please send comments to
sendmail@okeeffe.CS.Berkeley.EDU.
.pp
Our configuration files are processed by
.i m4
to facilitate local customization;
the directory
.i cf
of the
sendmail
distribution directory
contains the source files.
This directory contains several subdirectories:
.nr ii 1i
.ip cf
Both site-dependent and site-independent descriptions of hosts.
These can be literal host names
(e.g.,
.q ucbvax.mc )
when the hosts are gateways
or more general descriptions
(such as
.q "tcpproto.mc"
as a general description of an SMTP-connected host
or
.q "uucpproto.mc"
as a general description of a UUCP-connected host).
Files ending
.b \&.mc
(``Master Configuration'')
are the input descriptions;
the output is in the corresponding
.b \&.cf
file.
The general structure of these files is described below.
.ip domain
Site-dependent subdomain descriptions.
These are tied to the way your organization wants to do addressing.
For example,
.b domain/cs.exposed.m4
is our description for hosts in the CS.Berkeley.EDU subdomain
that want their individual hostname to be externally visible;
.b domain/cs.hidden.m4
is the same except that the hostname is hidden
(everything looks like it comes from CS.Berkeley.EDU).
These are referenced using the
.sm DOMAIN
.b m4
macro in the
.b \&.mc
file.
.ip feature
Definitions of specific features that some particular host in your site
might want.
These are referenced using the
.sm FEATURE
.b m4
macro.
Example features are
no_wildcard_MX
(which improves performance if you don't have a wildcard MX record
matching your domain)
and
use_cw_file
(which tells sendmail to read an /etc/sendmail.cw file on startup
to find the set of local names).
.ip hack
Local hacks, referenced using the
.sm HACK
.b m4
macro.
Try to avoid these.
The point of having them here is to make it clear that they smell.
.ip m4
Site-independent
.i m4 (1)
include files that have information common to all configuration files.
This can be thought of as a
.q #include
directory.
.ip mailer
Definitions of mailers,
referenced using the
.sm MAILER
.b m4
macro.
Defined mailer types in this distribution are
local,
smtp,
and uucp.
.ip ostype
Definitions describing various operating system environments
(such as the location of support files).
These are referenced using the
.sm OSTYPE
.b m4
macro.
.ip sh
Shell files used by the
.b m4
build process.
You shouldn't have to mess with these.
.ip siteconfig
Local site configuration information,
such as UUCP connectivity.
They normally contain lists of site information, for example:
.(b
SITE(contessa)
SITE(hoptoad)
SITE(nkainc)
SITE(well)
.)b
They are referenced using the SITECONFIG macro:
.(b
SITECONFIG(site.config.file, name_of_site, X)
.)b
where
.i X
is the macro/class name to use.
It can be U
(indicating locally connected hosts)
or one of W, X, or Y
for up to three remote UUCP hubs.
.pp
If you are in a new domain
(e.g., a company),
you will probably want to create a
cf/domain
file for your domain.
This consists primarily of relay definitions:
for example, Berkeley's domain definition
defines relays for
BitNET,
CSNET,
and UUCP.
Of these,
only the UUCP relay is particularly specific
to Berkeley.
All of these are internet-style domain names.
Please check to make certain they are reasonable for your domain.
.pp
Subdomains at Berkeley are also represented in the
cf/domain
directory.
For example,
the domain
cs-exposed
is the Computer Science subdomain with the local hostname shown
to other users;
cs-hidden
makes users appear to be from the CS.Berkeley.EDU subdomain
(with no local host information included).
You will probably have to update this directory
to be appropriate for your domain.
.pp
You will have to use or create
.b \&.mc
files in the
.i cf/cf
subdirectory for your hosts.
This is detailed in the
cf/README
file.
.sh 2 "Details of Installation Files"
.pp
This subsection describes the files that
comprise the
sendmail
installation.
.sh 3 "/usr/\*(SD/sendmail"
.pp
The binary for sendmail is located in /usr/\*(SD\**.
.(f
\**This is usually
/usr/sbin
on 4.4BSD and newer systems;
many systems install it in
/usr/lib.
I understand it is in /usr/ucblib
on System V Release 4.
.)f
It should be setuid root.
For security reasons,
/, /usr, and /usr/\*(SD
should be owned by root, mode 755\**.
.(f
\**Some vendors ship them owned by bin;
this creates a security hole that is not actually related to
.i sendmail .
Other important directories that should have restrictive ownerships
and permissions are
/bin, /usr/bin, /etc, /usr/etc, /lib, and /usr/lib.
.)f
.sh 3 "/etc/sendmail.cf"
.pp
This is the configuration file for sendmail.
This and the frozen configuration file
are the only two non-library file names compiled into sendmail\**.
.(f
\**The system libraries can reference other files;
in particular, system library subroutines that
sendmail
calls probably reference
.i /etc/passwd
and
.i /etc/resolv.conf .
.)f
Some older systems install it in
.b /usr/lib/sendmail.cf .
.pp
If you want to move this file,
change
.i src/pathnames.h .
.pp
The configuration file is normally created
using the distribution files described above.
If you have a particularly unusual system configuration
you may need to create a special version.
The format of this file is detailed in later sections
of this document.
.sh 3 "/usr/ucb/newaliases"
.pp
If you are running delivermail,
it is critical that the
.i newaliases
command be replaced.
This can just be a link to
.i sendmail :
.(b
rm \-f /usr/ucb/newaliases
ln /usr/\*(SD/sendmail /usr/ucb/newaliases
.)b
This can be installed in whatever search path you prefer
for your system.
.sh 3 "/var/spool/mqueue"
.pp
The directory
.i /var/spool/mqueue
should be created to hold the mail queue.
This directory should be mode 700
and owned by root.
.pp
The actual path of this directory
is defined in the
.b Q
option of the
.i sendmail.cf
file.
.sh 3 "/etc/aliases*"
.pp
The system aliases are held in
.q /etc/aliases .
A sample is given in
.q lib/aliases
which includes some aliases which
.i must
be defined:
.(b
cp lib/aliases /etc/aliases
.i "edit /etc/aliases"
.)b
You should extend this file with any aliases that are apropos to your system.
.pp
Normally
.i sendmail
looks at a version of these files maintained by the
.i dbm \|(3)
or
.i db \|(3)
routines.
These are stored either in
.q /etc/aliases.dir
and
.q /etc/aliases.pag
or
.q /etc/aliases.db
depending on which database package you are using.
These can initially be created as empty files,
but they will have to be initialized promptly.
These should be mode 644:
.(b
cp /dev/null /etc/aliases.dir
cp /dev/null /etc/aliases.pag
chmod 644 /etc/aliases.*
newaliases
.)b
The
.i db
routines preset the mode reasonably,
so this step can be skipped.
The actual path of this file
is defined in the
.b A
option of the
.i sendmail.cf
file.
.sh 3 "/etc/sendmail.fc"
.pp
If you intend to install the frozen version of the configuration file
(for quick startup)
you should create the file /etc/sendmail.fc
and initialize it.
This step may be safely skipped.
.(b
cp /dev/null /etc/sendmail.fc
chmod 644 /etc/sendmail.fc
/usr/\*(SD/sendmail \-bz
.)b
In general, freeze files are not worth doing
unless your disks are much faster than your CPU;
this is seldom true any more.
.sh 3 "/etc/rc"
.pp
It will be necessary to start up the sendmail daemon when your system reboots.
This daemon performs two functions:
it listens on the SMTP socket for connections
(to receive mail from a remote system)
and it processes the queue periodically
to insure that mail gets delivered when hosts come up.
.pp
Add the following lines to
.q /etc/rc
(or
.q /etc/rc.local
as appropriate)
in the area where it is starting up the daemons:
.(b
if [ \-f /usr/\*(SD/sendmail \-a \-f /etc/sendmail.cf ]; then
	(cd /var/spool/mqueue; rm \-f [lnx]f*)
	/usr/\*(SD/sendmail \-bd \-q30m &
	echo \-n ' sendmail' >/dev/console
fi
.)b
The
.q cd
and
.q rm
commands insure that all lock files have been removed;
extraneous lock files may be left around
if the system goes down in the middle of processing a message.
The line that actually invokes
.i sendmail
has two flags:
.q \-bd
causes it to listen on the SMTP port,
and
.q \-q30m
causes it to run the queue every half hour.
.pp
If you are not running a version of UNIX
that supports Berkeley TCP/IP,
do not include the
.b \-bd
flag.
.sh 3 "/usr/lib/sendmail.hf"
.pp
This is the help file used by the SMTP
.b HELP
command.
It should be copied from
.q lib/sendmail.hf :
.(b
cp lib/sendmail.hf /usr/lib
.)b
The actual path of this file
is defined in the
.b H
option of the
.i sendmail.cf
file.
.sh 3 "/etc/sendmail.st"
.pp
If you wish to collect statistics
about your mail traffic,
you should create the file
.q /etc/sendmail.st :
.(b
cp /dev/null /etc/sendmail.st
chmod 666 /etc/sendmail.st
.)b
This file does not grow.
It is printed with the program
.q mailstats/mailstats.c.
The actual path of this file
is defined in the
.b S
option of the
.i sendmail.cf
file.
.sh 3 "/usr/ucb/newaliases"
.pp
If
.i sendmail
is invoked as
.q newaliases,
it will simulate the
.b \-bi
flag
(i.e., will rebuild the alias database;
see below).
This should be a link to /usr/\*(SD/sendmail.
.sh 3 "/usr/ucb/mailq"
.pp
If
.i sendmail
is invoked as
.q mailq,
it will simulate the
.b \-bp
flag
(i.e.,
.i sendmail
will print the contents of the mail queue;
see below).
This should be a link to /usr/\*(SD/sendmail.
.sh 1 "NORMAL OPERATIONS"
.sh 2 "Quick Configuration Startup"
.pp
A fast version of the configuration file
may be set up by using the
.b \-bz
flag:
.(b
/usr/\*(SD/sendmail \-bz
.)b
This creates the file
.i /etc/sendmail.fc
(\c
.q "frozen configuration" ).
This file is an image of
.i sendmail 's
data space after reading in the configuration file.
If this file exists,
it is used instead of
.i /etc/sendmail.cf
.i sendmail.fc
must be rebuilt manually every time
.i sendmail.cf
is changed.
.pp
The frozen configuration file will be ignored
if a
.b \-C
flag is specified
or if sendmail detects that it is out of date.
However, the heuristics are not strong
so this should not be trusted.
.sh 2 "The System Log"
.pp
The system log is supported by the
.i syslogd \|(8)
program.
.sh 3 "Format"
.pp
Each line in the system log
consists of a timestamp,
the name of the machine that generated it
(for logging from several machines
over the local area network),
the word
.q sendmail: ,
and a message.
.sh 3 "Levels"
.pp
If you have
.i syslogd \|(8)
or an equivalent installed,
you will be able to do logging.
There is a large amount of information that can be logged.
The log is arranged as a succession of levels.
At the lowest level
only extremely strange situations are logged.
At the highest level,
even the most mundane and uninteresting events
are recorded for posterity.
As a convention,
log levels under ten
are considered
.q useful;
log levels above ten
are usually for debugging purposes.
.pp
A complete description of the log levels
is given in section 4.6.
.sh 2 "The Mail Queue"
.pp
The mail queue should be processed transparently.
However, you may find that manual intervention is sometimes necessary.
For example,
if a major host is down for a period of time
the queue may become clogged.
Although sendmail ought to recover gracefully when the host comes up,
you may find performance unacceptably bad in the meantime.
.sh 3 "Printing the queue"
.pp
The contents of the queue can be printed
using the
.i mailq
command
(or by specifying the
.b \-bp
flag to sendmail):
.(b
mailq
.)b
This will produce a listing of the queue id's,
the size of the message,
the date the message entered the queue,
and the sender and recipients.
.sh 3 "Forcing the queue"
.pp
.i Sendmail
should run the queue automatically
at intervals.
The algorithm is to read and sort the queue,
and then to attempt to process all jobs in order.
When it attempts to run the job,
.i sendmail
first checks to see if the job is locked.
If so, it ignores the job.
.pp
There is no attempt to insure that only one queue processor
exists at any time,
since there is no guarantee that a job cannot take forever
to process
(however,
.i sendmail
does include heuristics to try to abort jobs
that are taking absurd amounts of time;
technically, this violates RFC 821, but is blessed by RFC 1123).
Due to the locking algorithm,
it is impossible for one job to freeze the entire queue.
However,
an uncooperative recipient host
or a program recipient
that never returns
can accumulate many processes in your system.
Unfortunately,
there is no completely general way to solve this.
.pp
In some cases,
you may find that a major host going down
for a couple of days
may create a prohibitively large queue.
This will result in
.i sendmail
spending an inordinate amount of time
sorting the queue.
This situation can be fixed by moving the queue to a temporary place
and creating a new queue.
The old queue can be run later when the offending host returns to service.
.pp
To do this,
it is acceptable to move the entire queue directory:
.(b
cd /var/spool
mv mqueue omqueue; mkdir mqueue; chmod 700 mqueue
.)b
You should then kill the existing daemon
(since it will still be processing in the old queue directory)
and create a new daemon.
.pp
To run the old mail queue,
run the following command:
.(b
/usr/\*(SD/sendmail \-oQ/var/spool/omqueue \-q
.)b
The
.b \-oQ
flag specifies an alternate queue directory
and the
.b \-q
flag says to just run every job in the queue.
If you have a tendency toward voyeurism,
you can use the
.b \-v
flag to watch what is going on.
.pp
When the queue is finally emptied,
you can remove the directory:
.(b
rmdir /var/spool/omqueue
.)b
.sh 2 "The Alias Database"
.pp
The alias database exists in two forms.
One is a text form,
maintained in the file
.i /etc/aliases.
The aliases are of the form
.(b
name: name1, name2, ...
.)b
Only local names may be aliased;
e.g.,
.(b
eric@prep.ai.MIT.EDU: eric@CS.Berkeley.EDU
.)b
will not have the desired effect.
Aliases may be continued by starting any continuation lines
with a space or a tab.
Blank lines and lines beginning with a sharp sign
(\c
.q # )
are comments.
.pp
The second form is processed by the
.i dbm \|(3)
(or
.i db \|(3))
library.
This form is in the files
.i /etc/aliases.dir
and
.i /etc/aliases.pag.
This is the form that
.i sendmail
actually uses to resolve aliases.
This technique is used to improve performance.
.sh 3 "Rebuilding the alias database"
.pp
The DBM version of the database
may be rebuilt explicitly by executing the command
.(b
newaliases
.)b
This is equivalent to giving
.i sendmail
the
.b \-bi
flag:
.(b
/usr/\*(SD/sendmail \-bi
.)b
.pp
If the
.q D
option is specified in the configuration,
.i sendmail
will rebuild the alias database automatically
if possible
when it is out of date.
Auto-rebuild can be dangerous
on heavily loaded machines
with large alias files;
if it might take more than five minutes
to rebuild the database,
there is a chance that several processes will start the rebuild process
simultaneously.
.sh 3 "Potential problems"
.pp
There are a number of problems that can occur
with the alias database.
They all result from a
.i sendmail
process accessing the DBM version
while it is only partially built.
This can happen under two circumstances:
One process accesses the database
while another process is rebuilding it,
or the process rebuilding the database dies
(due to being killed or a system crash)
before completing the rebuild.
.pp
Sendmail has two techniques to try to relieve these problems.
First, it ignores interrupts while rebuilding the database;
this avoids the problem of someone aborting the process
leaving a partially rebuilt database.
Second,
at the end of the rebuild
it adds an alias of the form
.(b
@: @
.)b
(which is not normally legal).
Before sendmail will access the database,
it checks to insure that this entry exists\**.
.(f
\**The
.q a
option is required in the configuration
for this action to occur.
This should normally be specified
unless you are running
.i delivermail
in parallel with
.i sendmail.
.)f
.sh 3 "List owners"
.pp
If an error occurs on sending to a certain address,
say
.q \fIx\fP ,
.i sendmail
will look for an alias
of the form
.q owner-\fIx\fP
to receive the errors.
This is typically useful
for a mailing list
where the submitter of the list
has no control over the maintenance of the list itself;
in this case the list maintainer would be the owner of the list.
For example:
.(b
unix-wizards: eric@ucbarpa, wnj@monet, nosuchuser,
	sam@matisse
owner-unix-wizards: eric@ucbarpa
.)b
would cause
.q eric@ucbarpa
to get the error that will occur
when someone sends to
unix-wizards
due to the inclusion of
.q nosuchuser
on the list.
.sh 2 "User Information Database"
.pp
If you have a version of
.i sendmail
with the user information database
compiled in,
and you have specified one or more databases using the
.b U
option,
the databases will be searched for a
.i user :maildrop
entry.
If found, the mail will be sent to the specified address.
.pp
If the first token passed to user part of the
.q local
mailer is an at sign,
the at sign will be stripped off
and this step will be skipped.
.sh 2 "Per-User Forwarding (.forward Files)"
.pp
As an alternative to the alias database,
any user may put a file with the name
.q .forward
in his or her home directory.
If this file exists,
.i sendmail
redirects mail for that user
to the list of addresses listed in the .forward file.
For example, if the home directory for user
.q mckusick
has a .forward file with contents:
.(b
mckusick@ernie
kirk@calder
.)b
then any mail arriving for
.q mckusick
will be redirected to the specified accounts.
.pp
Actually, the configuration file defines a sequence of filenames to check.
By default, this is the user's .forward file,
but can be defined to be more generally using the
.b J
option.
If you change this,
you will have to inform your user base of the change;
\&.forward is pretty well incorporated into the collective subconscious.
.sh 2 "Special Header Lines"
.pp
Several header lines have special interpretations
defined by the configuration file.
Others have interpretations built into
.i sendmail
that cannot be changed without changing the code.
These builtins are described here.
.sh 3 "Return-Receipt-To:"
.pp
If this header is sent,
a message will be sent to any specified addresses
when the final delivery is complete,
that is,
when successfully delivered to a mailer with the
.b l
flag (local delivery) set in the mailer descriptor.
.sh 3 "Errors-To:"
.pp
If errors occur anywhere during processing,
this header will cause error messages to go to
the listed addresses
rather than to the sender.
This is intended for mailing lists.
.sh 3 "Apparently-To:"
.pp
If a message comes in with no recipients listed in the message
(in a To:, Cc:, or Bcc: line)
then
.i sendmail
will add an
.q "Apparently-To:"
header line for any recipients it is aware of.
This is not put in as a standard recipient line
to warn any recipients that the list is not complete.
.pp
At least one recipient line is required under RFC 822.
.sh 1 "ARGUMENTS"
.pp
The complete list of arguments to
.i sendmail
is described in detail in Appendix A.
Some important arguments are described here.
.sh 2 "Queue Interval"
.pp
The amount of time between forking a process
to run through the queue
is defined by the
.b \-q
flag.
If you run in mode
.b f
or
.b a
this can be relatively large,
since it will only be relevant
when a host that was down comes back up.
If you run in
.b q
mode
it should be relatively short,
since it defines the maximum amount of time that a message
may sit in the queue.
.sh 2 "Daemon Mode"
.pp
If you allow incoming mail over an IPC connection,
you should have a daemon running.
This should be set by your
.i /etc/rc
file using the
.b \-bd
flag.
The
.b \-bd
flag and the
.b \-q
flag may be combined in one call:
.(b
/usr/\*(SD/sendmail \-bd \-q30m
.)b
.sh 2 "Forcing the Queue"
.pp
In some cases you may find that the queue has gotten clogged for some reason.
You can force a queue run
using the
.b \-q
flag (with no value).
It is entertaining to use the
.b \-v
flag (verbose)
when this is done to watch what happens:
.(b
/usr/\*(SD/sendmail \-q \-v
.)b
.sh 2 "Debugging"
.pp
There are a fairly large number of debug flags
built into
.i sendmail .
Each debug flag has a number and a level,
where higher levels means to print out more information.
The convention is that levels greater than nine are
.q absurd,
i.e.,
they print out so much information that you wouldn't normally
want to see them except for debugging that particular piece of code.
Debug flags are set using the
.b \-d
option;
the syntax is:
.(b
.ta \w'debug-option  'u
debug-flag:	\fB\-d\fP debug-list
debug-list:	debug-option [ , debug-option ]
debug-option:	debug-range [ . debug-level ]
debug-range:	integer | integer \- integer
debug-level:	integer
.)b
where spaces are for reading ease only.
For example,
.(b
\-d12	Set flag 12 to level 1
\-d12.3	Set flag 12 to level 3
\-d3-17	Set flags 3 through 17 to level 1
\-d3-17.4	Set flags 3 through 17 to level 4
.)b
For a complete list of the available debug flags
you will have to look at the code
(they are too dynamic to keep this documentation up to date).
.sh 2 "Trying a Different Configuration File"
.pp
An alternative configuration file
can be specified using the
.b \-C
flag; for example,
.(b
/usr/\*(SD/sendmail \-Ctest.cf
.)b
uses the configuration file
.i test.cf
instead of the default
.i /etc/sendmail.cf.
If the
.b \-C
flag has no value
it defaults to
.i sendmail.cf
in the current directory.
.sh 2 "Changing the Values of Options"
.pp
Options can be overridden using the
.b \-o
flag.
For example,
.(b
/usr/\*(SD/sendmail \-oT2m
.)b
sets the
.b T
(timeout) option to two minutes
for this run only.
.pp
Some options have security implications.
Sendmail allows you to set these,
but refuses to root as root thereafter.
.sh 1 "TUNING"
.pp
There are a number of configuration parameters
you may want to change,
depending on the requirements of your site.
Most of these are set
using an option in the configuration file.
For example,
the line
.q OT3d
sets option
.q T
to the value
.q 3d
(three days).
.pp
Most of these options have appropriate defaults for most sites.
However,
sites having very high mail loads may find they need to tune them
as appropriate for their mail load.
In particular,
sites experiencing a large number of small messages,
many of which are delivered to many recipients,
may find that they need to adjust the parameters
dealing with queue priorities.
.sh 2 "Timeouts"
.pp
All time intervals are set
using a scaled syntax.
For example,
.q 10m
represents ten minutes, whereas
.q 2h30m
represents two and a half hours.
The full set of scales is:
.(b
.ta 4n
s	seconds
m	minutes
h	hours
d	days
w	weeks
.)b
.sh 3 "Queue interval"
.pp
The argument to the
.b \-q
flag
specifies how often a sub-daemon will run the queue.
This is typically set to between fifteen minutes
and one hour.
.sh 3 "Read timeouts"
.pp
It is possible to time out when reading the standard input
or when reading from a remote SMTP server.
Technically,
this is not acceptable within the published protocols.
However,
it might be appropriate to set it to something large
in certain environments
(such as an hour).
This will reduce the chance of large numbers of idle daemons
piling up on your system.
This timeout is set using the
.b r
option in the configuration file.
.pp
RFC1123
recommends that this option be set to five minutes.
.i Sendmail
was designed to the RFC822 protocols,
which did not specify read timeouts;
hence,
.i sendmail
does not guarantee to reply to messages promptly.
In particular, a
.q RCPT
command specifying a mailing list
will expand and verify the entire list;
a large list on a slow system
may take more than five minutes\**.
.(f
\**This verification includes looking up every address
with the name server;
this involves network delays,
and can in some cases can be considerable.
.)f
I recommend a two hour timeout \*-
since this failure is rare,
a long timeout is not onerous
and may ultimately help reduce network load.
.pp
The timeout for a user SMTP process
waiting for the initial
.q HELO
message
is hard-wired to five minutes.
.sh 3 "Message timeouts"
.pp
After sitting in the queue for a few days,
a message will time out.
This is to insure that at least the sender is aware
of the inability to send a message.
The timeout is typically set to three days.
This timeout is set using the
.b T
option in the configuration file.
.pp
The time of submission is set in the queue,
rather than the amount of time left until timeout.
As a result, you can flush messages that have been hanging
for a short period
by running the queue
with a short message timeout.
For example,
.(b
/usr/\*(SD/sendmail \-oT1d \-q
.)b
will run the queue
and flush anything that is one day old.
.pp
Since this option is global,
and since you can not
.i "a priori"
know how long another host outside your domain will be down,
a three day timeout is recommended.
This allows a recipient to fix the problem even if it occurs
at the beginning of a weekend.
.sh 2 "Forking During Queue Runs"
.pp
By setting the
.b Y
option,
.i sendmail
will fork before each individual message
while running the queue.
This will prevent
.i sendmail
from consuming large amounts of memory,
so it may be useful in memory-poor environments.
However, if the
.b Y
option is not set,
.i sendmail
will keep track of hosts that are down during a queue run,
which can improve performance dramatically.
.pp
If the
.b Y
option is set,
.i sendmail
can not use connection caching.
.sh 2 "Queue Priorities"
.pp
Every message is assigned a priority when it is first instantiated,
consisting of the message size (in bytes)
offset by the message class times the
.q "work class factor"
and the number of recipients times the
.q "work recipient factor."
The priority plus the creation time of the message
(in seconds since January 1, 1970)
are used to order the queue.
Higher numbers for the priority mean that the message will be processed later
when running the queue.
.pp
The message size is included so that large messages are penalized
relative to small messages.
The message class allows users to send
.q "high priority"
messages by including a
.q Precedence:
field in their message;
the value of this field is looked up in the
.b P
lines of the configuration file.
Since the number of recipients affects the amount of load a message presents
to the system,
this is also included into the priority.
.pp
The recipient and class factors
can be set in the configuration file using the
.b y
and
.b z
options respectively.
They default to 1000 (for the recipient factor)
and 1800
(for the class factor).
The initial priority is:
.EQ
pri = size - (class times z) + (nrcpt times y)
.EN
(Remember, higher values for this parameter actually mean
that the job will be treated with lower priority.)
.pp
The priority of a job can also be adjusted each time it is processed
(that is, each time an attempt is made to deliver it)
using the
.q "work time factor,"
set by the
.b Z
option.
This is added to the priority,
so it normally decreases the precedence of the job,
on the grounds that jobs that have failed many times
will tend to fail again in the future.
.sh 2 "Load Limiting"
.pp
.i Sendmail
can be asked to queue (but not deliver)
mail if the system load average gets too high
using the
.b x
option.
When the load average exceeds the value of the
.b x
option,
the delivery mode is set to
.b q
(queue only)
if the
.i "Queue Factor"
(\c
.b q
option)
divided by the difference in the current load average and the
.b x
option
plus one
exceeds the priority of the message \(em
that is, the message is queued iff:
.EQ
pri > QF over { LA - x + 1 }
.EN
The
.b q
option defaults to 10000,
so each point of load average is worth 10000
priority points
(as described above, that is, bytes + seconds + offsets).
.pp
For drastic cases,
the
.b X
option defines a load average at which sendmail will refuse
to accept network connections.
Locally generated mail
(including incoming UUCP mail)
is still accepted.
.sh 2 "Delivery Mode"
.pp
There are a number of delivery modes that
.i sendmail
can operate in,
set by the
.q d
configuration option.
These modes
specify how quickly mail will be delivered.
Legal modes are:
.(b
.ta 4n
i	deliver interactively (synchronously)
b	deliver in background (asynchronously)
q	queue only (don't deliver)
.)b
There are tradeoffs.
Mode
.q i
passes the maximum amount of information to the sender,
but is hardly ever necessary.
Mode
.q q
puts the minimum load on your machine,
but means that delivery may be delayed for up to the queue interval.
Mode
.q b
is probably a good compromise.
However, this mode can cause large numbers of processes
if you have a mailer that takes a long time to deliver a message.
.sh 2 "Log Level"
.pp
The level of logging can be set for sendmail.
The default using a standard configuration table is level 9.
The levels are as follows:
.nr ii 0.5i
.ip 0
No logging.
.ip 1
Major problems only.
.ip 2
Message collections and failed deliveries.
.ip 3
Successful deliveries.
.ip 4
Messages being deferred
(due to a host being down, etc.).
.ip 5
Normal message queueups.
.ip 6
Unusual but benign incidents,
e.g.,
trying to process a locked queue file.
.ip 9
Log internal queue id to external message id mappings.
This can be useful for tracing a message
as it travels between several hosts.
Also logs any VRFY or EXPN requests.
.ip 11
Logs attempts to run locked queue files.
These are not errors,
but can be useful to note if your queue appears to be clogged.
.ip 12
Several messages that are basically only of interest
when debugging.
.ip 16
Verbose information regarding the queue.
.sh 2 "Wildcard MX Records"
.pp
Normally, when
.i sendmail
is looking up host names from the name server,
it uses the querytype of
.q CNAME .
The
.b w
option will ask the name server to use a querytype of
.q ANY .
This finds CNAME, A, and MX records,
and causes the local name server to cache all records it finds,
thus improving performance.
.pp
However, if your site has wildcard MX records, this can cause problems.
For example, suppose your site has a record directing
.q "*.HiTech.COM"
to
.q "gateway.HiTech.COM" .
When the resolver looks for (e.g.)
.q "mammoth.Berkeley.EDU" ,
it starts by appending the local domain name (in this case,
.q "HiTech.COM" ),
thus looking for
.q "mammoth.Berkeley.EDU.HiTech.COM"
\*- which of course matches
.q "*.HiTech.COM" .
.pp
If you do not have wildcard MX records in your domain,
you can set the
.b w
option to get better performance.
.sh 2 "File Modes"
.pp
There are a number of files
that may have a number of modes.
The modes depend on what functionality you want
and the level of security you require.
.sh 3 "To suid or not to suid?"
.pp
.i Sendmail
can safely be made
setuid to root.
At the point where it is about to
.i exec \|(2)
a mailer,
it checks to see if the userid is zero;
if so,
it resets the userid and groupid to a default
(set by the
.b u
and
.b g
options).
(This can be overridden
by setting the
.b S
flag to the mailer
for mailers that are trusted
and must be called as root.)
However,
this will cause mail processing
to be accounted
(using
.i sa \|(8))
to root
rather than to the user sending the mail.
.sh 3 "Should my alias database be writable?"
.pp
At Berkeley
we have the alias database
(/etc/aliases*)
mode 644.
While this is not as flexible as if the database
were more 666, it avoids potential security problems
with a globally writable database.
.pp
The database that
.i sendmail
actually used
is represented by the two files
.i aliases.dir
and
.i aliases.pag
(both in /etc)
(or
.i aliases.db
if you are running with the new Berkeley database primitives).
The mode on these files should match the mode
on /etc/aliases.
If
.i aliases
is writable
and the
DBM
files
(\c
.i aliases.dir
and
.i aliases.pag )
are not,
users will be unable to reflect their desired changes
through to the actual database.
However,
if
.i aliases
is read-only
and the DBM files are writable,
a slightly sophisticated user
can arrange to steal mail anyway.
.pp
If your DBM files are not writable by the world
or you do not have auto-rebuild enabled
(with the
.q D
option),
then you must be careful to reconstruct the alias database
each time you change the text version:
.(b
newaliases
.)b
If this step is ignored or forgotten
any intended changes will also be ignored or forgotten.
.sh 2 "Connection Caching"
.pp
When processing the queue,
.b sendmail
will try to keep the last few open connections open
to avoid startup and shutdown costs.
This only applies to IPC connections.
.pp
When trying to open a connection
the cache is first searched.
If an open connection is found, it is probed to see if it is still active
by sending a
.sm NOOP
command.
It is not an error if this fails;
instead, the connection is closed and reopened.
.pp
Two parameters control the connection cache.
The
.b k
option defines the number of simultaneous open connections
that will be permitted.
If it is set to zero,
connections will be closed as quickly as possible.
The default is one.
This should be set as appropriate for your system size;
it will limit the amount of system resources that
.b sendmail
will use during queue runs.
.pp
The
.b K
option specifies the maximum time that any cached connection
will be permitted to idle.
When the idle time exceeds this value
the connection is closed.
This number should be small
(under ten minutes)
to prevent you from grabbing too many resources
from other hosts.
The default is five minutes.
.sh 2 "Name Server Access"
.pp
If your system supports the name server,
then the probability is that
.i sendmail
will be using it regardless of how you configure sendmail.
However, if you have nameserver support
which you are not using,
sendmail will get a
.q "connection refused"
message when it tries to connect to the name server
(either by calling
.i gethostbyname
or by trying to look up the MX records).
If the
.b I
option is set,
.i sendmail
will interpret this to mean a temporary failure;
otherwise, it ignores the name server data.
If your name server is running properly,
the setting of this option is not relevant;
however, it is important that it be set properly
to make error handling work properly.
.pp
This option also allows you to tweak name server options.
The command line takes a series of flags as documented in
.i resolver (3)
(with the leading
.q RES_
deleted).
Each can be preceded by an optional `+' or `\(mi'.
For example, the line
.(b
OITrue +AAONLY \(miDNSRCH
.)b
turns on the AAONLY (accept authoritative answers only)
and turns off the DNSRCH (search the domain path) options.
Most resolver libraries default DNSRCH, DEFNAMES, and RECURSE
flags on and all others off.
Note the use of the initial ``True'' \*-
this is for compatibility with previous versions of sendmail,
but is not otherwise necessary.
.pp
Version 1 configurations
turn DNSRCH and DEFNAMES off when doing delivery lookups,
but leave them on everywhere else.
Release 6 of
.i sendmail
ignores them when doing canonification lookups
(that is, when using $[ ... $]),
and always does the search.
If you don't want to do automatic name extension,
don't call $[ ... $].
.pp
The search rules for $[ ... $] are somewhat different than usual.
If the name (that is, the ``...'')
has at least one dot, it always tries the unmodified name first.
If that fails, it tries the reduced search path,
and lastly tries the unmodified name
(but only for names without a dot,
since names with a dot have already been tried).
This allows names such as
``utc.CS''
to match the site in Czechoslovakia
rather than the site in your local Computer Science department.
.sh 2 "Moving the Per-User Forward Files"
.pp
Some sites mount each user's home directory
from a local disk on their workstation,
so that local access is fast.
However, the result is that .forward file lookups are slow.
In some cases,
mail can even be delivered on machines inappropriately
because of a file server being down.
The performance can be especially bad if you run the automounter.
.pp
The
.b J
option allows you to set a path of forward files.
For example, the config file line
.(b
OJ/var/forward/$u:$z/.forward
.)b
would first look for a file with the same name as the user's login
in /var/forward;
if that is not found (or is inaccessible)
the file
.q \&.forward
in the user's home directory is searched.
A truly perverse site could also search by sender
by using $r, $s, or $f.
.pp
If you create a directory such as /var/forward,
it should be mode 1777
(that is, the sticky bit should be set).
Users should create the files mode 644.
.sh 1 "THE WHOLE SCOOP ON THE CONFIGURATION FILE"
.pp
This section describes the configuration file
in detail,
including hints on how to write one of your own
if you have to.
.pp
There is one point that should be made clear immediately:
the syntax of the configuration file
is designed to be reasonably easy to parse,
since this is done every time
.i sendmail
starts up,
rather than easy for a human to read or write.
On the
.q "future project"
list is a
configuration-file compiler.
.pp
An overview of the configuration file
is given first,
followed by details of the semantics.
.sh 2 "Configuration File Lines"
.pp
The configuration file is organized as a series of lines,
each of which begins with a single character
defining the semantics for the rest of the line.
Lines beginning with a space or a tab
are continuation lines
(although the semantics are not well defined in many places).
Blank lines and lines beginning with a sharp symbol
(`#')
are comments.
.sh 3 "R and S \*- rewriting rules"
.pp
The core of address parsing
are the rewriting rules.
These are an ordered production system.
.i Sendmail
scans through the set of rewriting rules
looking for a match on the left hand side
(LHS)
of the rule.
When a rule matches,
the address is replaced by the right hand side
(RHS)
of the rule.
.pp
There are several sets of rewriting rules.
Some of the rewriting sets are used internally
and must have specific semantics.
Other rewriting sets
do not have specifically assigned semantics,
and may be referenced by the mailer definitions
or by other rewriting sets.
.pp
The syntax of these two commands are:
.(b F
.b S \c
.i n
.)b
Sets the current ruleset being collected to
.i n .
If you begin a ruleset more than once
it deletes the old definition.
.(b F
.b R \c
.i lhs
.i rhs
.i comments
.)b
The
fields must be separated
by at least one tab character;
there may be embedded spaces
in the fields.
The
.i lhs
is a pattern that is applied to the input.
If it matches,
the input is rewritten to the
.i rhs .
The
.i comments
are ignored.
.sh 4 "The left hand side"
.pp
The left hand side of rewriting rules contains a pattern.
Normal words are simply matched directly.
Metasyntax is introduced using a dollar sign.
The metasymbols are:
.(b
.ta \w'\fB$=\fP\fIx\fP  'u
\fB$*\fP	Match zero or more tokens
\fB$+\fP	Match one or more tokens
\fB$\-\fP	Match exactly one token
\fB$=\fP\fIx\fP	Match any token in class \fIx\fP
\fB$~\fP\fIx\fP	Match any token not in class \fIx\fP
.)b
If any of these match,
they are assigned to the symbol
.b $ \c
.i n
for replacement on the right hand side,
where
.i n
is the index in the LHS.
For example,
if the LHS:
.(b
$\-:$+
.)b
is applied to the input:
.(b
UCBARPA:eric
.)b
the rule will match, and the values passed to the RHS will be:
.(b
.ta 4n
$1	UCBARPA
$2	eric
.)b
.sh 4 "The right hand side"
.pp
When the left hand side of a rewriting rule matches,
the input is deleted and replaced by the right hand side.
Tokens are copied directly from the RHS
unless they begin with a dollar sign.
Metasymbols are:
.(b
.ta \w'$#mailer\0\0\0'u
\fB$\fP\fIn\fP	Substitute indefinite token \fIn\fP from LHS
\fB$[\fP\fIname\fP\fB$]\fP	Canonicalize \fIname\fP
\fB$(\fP\fImap key\fP \fB$@\fP\fIarguments\fP \fB$:\fP\fIdefault\fP \fB$)\fP
	Generalized keyed mapping function
\fB$>\fP\fIn\fP	\*(lqCall\*(rq ruleset \fIn\fP
\fB$#\fP\fImailer\fP	Resolve to \fImailer\fP
\fB$@\fP\fIhost\fP	Specify \fIhost\fP
\fB$:\fP\fIuser\fP	Specify \fIuser\fP
.)b
.pp
The
.b $ \c
.i n
syntax substitutes the corresponding value from a
.b $+ ,
.b $\- ,
.b $* ,
.b $= ,
or
.b $~
match on the LHS.
It may be used anywhere.
.pp
A host name enclosed between
.b $[
and
.b $]
is looked up using the
.i gethostent \|(3)
routines and replaced by the canonical name.
For example,
.q $[csam$]
might become
.q lbl-csam.arpa
and
.q $[[128.32.130.2]$]
would become
.q vangogh.CS.Berkeley.EDU.
.pp
The
.b $(
\&...
.b $)
syntax is a more general form of lookup;
it uses a named map instead of an implicit map.
If no lookup is found, the indicted
.i default
is inserted;
if no default is specified and no lookup matches,
the value is left unchanged.
.pp
The
.b $> \c
.i n
syntax
causes the remainder of the line to be substituted as usual
and then passed as the argument to ruleset
.i n .
The final value of ruleset
.i n
then becomes
the substitution for this rule.
.pp
The
.b $#
syntax should
.i only
be used in ruleset zero.
It causes evaluation of the ruleset to terminate immediately,
and signals to sendmail that the address has completely resolved.
The complete syntax is:
.(b
\fB$#\fP\fImailer\fP\fB$@\fP\fIhost\fP\fB$:\fP\fIuser\fP
.)b
This specifies the
{mailer, host, user}
3-tuple necessary to direct the mailer.
If the mailer is local
the host part may be omitted.
The
.i mailer
and
.i host
must be a single word,
but the
.i user
may be multi-part.
.pp
A RHS may also be preceded by a
.b $@
or a
.b $:
to control evaluation.
A
.b $@
prefix causes the ruleset to return with the remainder of the RHS
as the value.
A
.b $:
prefix causes the rule to terminate immediately,
but the ruleset to continue;
this can be used to avoid continued application of a rule.
The prefix is stripped before continuing.
.pp
The
.b $@
and
.b $:
prefixes may precede a
.b $>
spec;
for example:
.(b
.ta 8n
R$+	$:$>7$1
.)b
matches anything,
passes that to ruleset seven,
and continues;
the
.b $:
is necessary to avoid an infinite loop.
.pp
Substitution occurs in the order described,
that is,
parameters from the LHS are substituted,
hostnames are canonicalized,
.q subroutines
are called,
and finally
.b $# ,
.b $@ ,
and
.b $:
are processed.
..sh 3 "D \*- define macro"
.pp
Macros are named with a single character.
These may be selected from the entire ASCII set,
but user-defined macros
should be selected from the set of upper case letters only.
Lower case letters
and special symbols
are used internally.
.pp
The syntax for macro definitions is:
.(b F
.b D \c
.i x\|val
.)b
where
.i x
is the name of the macro
and
.i val
is the value it should have.
.pp
Macros are interpolated
using the construct
.b $ \c
.i x ,
where
.i x
is the name of the macro to be interpolated.
In particular,
lower case letters are reserved to have
special semantics,
used to pass information in or out of sendmail,
and some special characters are reserved to
provide conditionals, etc.
.pp
Conditionals can be specified using the syntax:
.(b
$?x text1 $| text2 $.
.)b
This interpolates
.i text1
if the macro
.b $x
is set,
and
.i text2
otherwise.
The
.q else
(\c
.b $| )
clause may be omitted.
.pp
The following macros
.i must
be defined to transmit information into
.i sendmail:
.(b
.ta 4n
e	The SMTP entry message
j	The \*(lqofficial\*(rq domain name for this site
l	The format of the UNIX from line
n	The name of the daemon (for error messages)
o	The set of "operators" in addresses
q	default format of sender address
.)b
The
.b $e
macro is printed out when SMTP starts up.
The first word must be the
.b $j
macro.
The
.b $j
macro
should be in RFC821 format.
The
.b $l
and
.b $n
macros can be considered constants
except under terribly unusual circumstances.
The
.b $o
macro consists of a list of characters
which will be considered tokens
and which will separate tokens
when doing parsing.
For example, if
.q @
were in the
.b $o
macro, then the input
.q a@b
would be scanned as three tokens:
.q a,
.q @,
and
.q b.
Finally, the
.b $q
macro specifies how an address should appear in a message
when it is defaulted.
For example, on our system these definitions are:
.(b
De$j Sendmail $v ready at $b
DnMAILER-DAEMON
DlFrom $<  $d
Do.:%@!^/
Dq$g$?x ($x)$.
Dj$H.$D
.)b
An acceptable alternative for the
.b $q
macro is
.q "$?x$x $.<$g>" .
These correspond to the following two formats:
.(b
eric@CS.Berkeley.EDU (Eric Allman)
Eric Allman <eric@CS.Berkeley.EDU>
.)b
.pp
Some macros are defined by
.i sendmail
for interpolation into argv's for mailers
or for other contexts.
These macros are:
.(b
a	The origination date in RFC 822 format
b	The current date in RFC 822 format
c	The hop count
d	The date in UNIX (ctime) format
f	The sender (from) address
g	The sender address relative to the recipient
h	The recipient host
i	The queue id
m	The domain part of the \fIgethostname\fP return value
p	Sendmail's pid
r	Protocol used to receive the message
s	Sender's host name
t	A numeric representation of the current time
u	The recipient user
v	The version number of sendmail
w	The hostname of this site
x	The full name of the sender
z	The home directory of the recipient
<	The return-path (sender in envelope) relative to recipient
.)b
.pp
There are three types of dates that can be used.
The
.b $a
and
.b $b
macros are in RFC 822 format;
.b $a
is the time as extracted from the
.q Date:
line of the message
(if there was one),
and
.b $b
is the current date and time
(used for postmarks).
If no
.q Date:
line is found in the incoming message,
.b $a
is set to the current time also.
The
.b $d
macro is equivalent to the
.b $a
macro in UNIX
(ctime)
format.
.pp
The
.b $f
macro is the id of the sender
as originally determined;
when mailing to a specific host
the
.b $g
macro is set to the address of the sender
.ul
relative to the recipient.
For example,
if I send to
.q bollard@matisse
from the machine
.q ucbarpa
the
.b $f
macro will be
.q eric
and the
.b $g
macro will be
.q eric@ucbarpa.
.pp
The
.b $<
macro is identical to the
.b $g
macro except that it uses the envelope sender
instead of the From: address in the body of the message.
.pp
The
.b $x
macro is set to the full name of the sender.
This can be determined in several ways.
It can be passed as flag to
.i sendmail.
The second choice is the value of the
.q Full-name:
line in the header if it exists,
and the third choice is the comment field
of a
.q From:
line.
If all of these fail,
and if the message is being originated locally,
the full name is looked up in the
.i /etc/passwd
file.
.pp
When sending,
the
.b $h ,
.b $u ,
and
.b $z
macros get set to the host, user, and home directory
(if local)
of the recipient.
The first two are set from the
.b $@
and
.b $:
part of the rewriting rules, respectively.
.pp
The
.b $p
and
.b $t
macros are used to create unique strings
(e.g., for the
.q Message-Id:
field).
The
.b $i
macro is set to the queue id on this host;
if put into the timestamp line
it can be extremely useful for tracking messages.
The
.b $v
macro is set to be the version number of
.i sendmail ;
this is normally put in timestamps
and has been proven extremely useful for debugging.
The
.b $w
macro is set to the name of this host
if it can be determined.
The
.b $c
field is set to the
.q "hop count,"
i.e., the number of times this message has been processed.
This can be determined
by the
.b \-h
flag on the command line
or by counting the timestamps in the message.
.pp
The
.b $r
and
.b $s
fields are set to the protocol used to communicate with sendmail
and the sending hostname.
.sh 4 "Semantics of rewriting rule sets"
.pp
There are five rewriting sets
that have specific semantics.
These are related as depicted by figure 2.

.)c
.hl
.)z
.pp
Ruleset three
should turn the address into
.q "canonical form."
This form should have the basic syntax:
.(b
local-part@host-domain-spec
.)b
If no
.q @
sign is specified,
then the
host-domain-spec
.i may
be appended from the
sender address
(if the
.b C
flag is set in the mailer definition
corresponding to the
.i sending
mailer).
Ruleset three
is applied by sendmail
before doing anything with any address.
.pp
Ruleset zero
is applied after ruleset three
to addresses that are going to actually specify recipients.
It must resolve to a
.i "{mailer, host, user}"
triple.
The
.i mailer
must be defined in the mailer definitions
from the configuration file.
The
.i host
is defined into the
.b $h
macro
for use in the argv expansion of the specified mailer.
.pp
Rulesets one and two
are applied to all sender and recipient addresses respectively.
They are applied before any specification
in the mailer definition.
They must never resolve.
.pp
Ruleset four is applied to all addresses
in the message.
It is typically used
to translate internal to external form.
.sh 3 "C and F \*- define classes"
.pp
Classes of words may be defined
to match on the left hand side of rewriting rules,
where a
.q word
is a sequence of characters that do not contain characters
in the $o macro.
For example
a class of all local names for this site
might be created
so that attempts to send to oneself
can be eliminated.
These can either be defined directly in the configuration file
or read in from another file.
Classes may be given names
from the set of upper case letters.
Lower case letters and special characters
are reserved for system use.
.pp
The syntax is:
.(b F
.b C \c
.i c\|word1
.i word2...
.br
.b F \c
.i c\|file
.)b
The first form defines the class
.i c
to match any of the named words.
It is permissible to split them among multiple lines;
for example, the two forms:
.(b
CHmonet ucbmonet
.)b
and
.(b
CHmonet
CHucbmonet
.)b
are equivalent.
The second form
reads the elements of the class
.i c
from the named
.i file .
.pp
The class
.b $=w
is set to be the set of all names
this host is known by.
This can be used to match local hostnames.
.sh 3 "M \*- define mailer"
.pp
Programs and interfaces to mailers
are defined in this line.
The format is:
.(b F
.b M \c
.i name ,
{\c
.i field =\c
.i value \|}*
.)b
where
.i name
is the name of the mailer
(used internally only)
and the
.q field=name
pairs define attributes of the mailer.
Fields are:
.(b
.ta 1i
Path	The pathname of the mailer
Flags	Special flags for this mailer
Sender	A rewriting set for sender addresses
Recipient	A rewriting set for recipient addresses
Argv	An argument vector to pass to this mailer
Eol	The end-of-line string for this mailer
Maxsize	The maximum message length to this mailer
Linelimit	The maximum line length in the message body
.)b
Only the first character of the field name is checked.
.pp
The following flags may be set in the mailer description.
Any other flags may be used freely
to conditionally assign headers to messages
destined for particular mailers.
.nr ii 4n
.ip C
If mail is
.i received
from a mailer with this flag set,
any addresses in the header that do not have an at sign
(\c
.q @ )
after being rewritten by ruleset three
will have the
.q @domain
clause from the sender
tacked on.
This allows mail with headers of the form:
.(b
From: usera@hosta
To: userb@hostb, userc
.)b
to be rewritten as:
.(b
From: usera@hosta
To: userb@hostb, userc@hosta
.)b
automatically.
.ip D
This mailer wants a
.q Date:
header line.
.ip e
This mailer is expensive to connect to,
so try to avoid connecting normally;
any necessary connection will occur during a queue run.
.ip E
Escape lines beginning with
.q From
in the message with a `>' sign.
.ip f
The mailer wants a
.b \-f
.i from
flag,
but only if this is a network forward operation
(i.e.,
the mailer will give an error
if the executing user
does not have special permissions).
.ip F
This mailer wants a
.q From:
header line.
.ip h
Upper case should be preserved in host names
for this mailer.
.ip I
This mailer will be speaking SMTP
to another
.i sendmail
\*-
as such it can use special protocol features.
This option is not required
(i.e.,
if this option is omitted the transmission will still operate successfully,
although perhaps not as efficiently as possible).
.ip l
This mailer is local
(i.e.,
final delivery will be performed).
.ip L
Limit the line lengths as specified in RFC821.
This deprecated option should be replaced by the
.b L=
mail declaration.
For historic reasons, the
.b L
flag also sets the
.b 7
flag.
.ip m
This mailer can send to multiple users
on the same host
in one transaction.
When a
.b $u
macro occurs in the
.i argv
part of the mailer definition,
that field will be repeated as necessary
for all qualifying users.
.ip M
This mailer wants a
.q Message-Id:
header line.
.ip n
Do not insert a UNIX-style
.q From
line on the front of the message.
.ip p
Use the return-path in the SMTP
.q "MAIL FROM:"
command
rather than just the return address;
although this is required in RFC821,
many hosts do not process return paths properly.
.ip P
This mailer wants a
.q Return-Path:
line.
.ip r
Same as
.b f ,
but sends a
.b \-r
flag.
.ip s
Strip quote characters off of the address
before calling the mailer.
.ip S
Don't reset the userid
before calling the mailer.
This would be used in a secure environment
where
.i sendmail
ran as root.
This could be used to avoid forged addresses.
This flag is suppressed if given from an
.q unsafe
environment
(e.g, a user's mail.cf file).
.ip u
Upper case should be preserved in user names
for this mailer.
.ip U
This mailer wants Unix-style
.q From
lines with the ugly UUCP-style
.q "remote from <host>"
on the end.
.ip x
This mailer wants a
.q Full-Name:
header line.
.ip X
This mailer want to use the hidden dot algorithm
as specified in RFC821;
basically,
any line beginning with a dot
will have an extra dot prepended
(to be stripped at the other end).
This insures that lines in the message containing a dot
will not terminate the message prematurely.
.ip 7
Strip all output to seven bits.
This is the default if the
.b L
flag is set.
Note that setting this is not
sufficient to get full eight bit data passed through
.i sendmail ;
the
.b 8
option must also be set.
.pp
The mailer with the special name
.q error
can be used to generate a user error.
The (optional) host field is an exit status to be returned,
and the user field is a message to be printed.
The exit status may be numeric or one of the values
USAGE, NOUSER, NOHOST, UNAVAILABLE, SOFTWARE, TEMPFAIL, PROTOCOL, or CONFIG
to return the corresponding EX_ exit code.
For example, the entry:
.(b
$#error $@ NOHOST $: Host unknown in this domain
.)b
on the RHS of a rule
will cause the specified error to be generated
and the
.q "Host unknown"
exit status to be returned
if the LHS matches.
This mailer is only functional in ruleset zero.
.sh 3 "H \*- define header"
.pp
The format of the header lines that sendmail inserts into the message
are defined by the
.b H
line.
The syntax of this line is:
.(b F
.b H [\c
.b ? \c
.i mflags \c
.b ? ]\c
.i hname \c
.b :
.i htemplate
.)b
Continuation lines in this spec
are reflected directly into the outgoing message.
The
.i htemplate
is macro expanded before insertion into the message.
If the
.i mflags
(surrounded by question marks)
are specified,
at least one of the specified flags
must be stated in the mailer definition
for this header to be automatically output.
If one of these headers is in the input
it is reflected to the output
regardless of these flags.
.pp
Some headers have special semantics
that will be described below.
.sh 3 "O \*- set option"
.pp
There are a number of
.q random
options that
can be set from a configuration file.
Options are represented by single characters.
The syntax of this line is:
.(b F
.b O \c
.i o\|value
.)b
This sets option
.i o
to be
.i value .
Depending on the option,
.i value
may be a string, an integer,
a boolean
(with legal values
.q t ,
.q T ,
.q f ,
or
.q F ;
the default is TRUE),
or
a time interval.
.pp
The options supported are:
.nr ii 1i
.ip a\fIN\fP
If set,
wait up to
.i N
minutes for an
.q @:@
entry to exist in the alias database
before starting up.
If it does not appear in
.i N
minutes,
rebuild the database
(if the
.b D
option is also set)
or issue a warning.
.ip A\fIfile\fP
Use the named
.i file
as the alias file.
If no file is specified,
use
.i aliases
in the current directory.
.ip B\fIc\fP
Set the blank substitution character to
.i c .
Unquoted spaces in addresses are replaced by this character.
.ip c
If an outgoing mailer is marked as being expensive,
don't connect immediately.
This requires that queueing be compiled in,
since it will depend on a queue run process to
actually send the mail.
.ip C\fIN\fP
Checkpoints the queue every
.i N
(default 10)
addresses sent.
If your system crashes during delivery to a large list,
this prevents retransmission to any but the last
.I N
recipients.
.ip d\fIx\fP
Deliver in mode
.i x .
Legal modes are:
.(b
.ta 4n
i	Deliver interactively (synchronously)
b	Deliver in background (asynchronously)
q	Just queue the message (deliver during queue run)
.)b
.ip D
If set,
rebuild the alias database if necessary and possible.
If this option is not set,
.i sendmail
will never rebuild the alias database
unless explicitly requested
using
.b \-bi .
.ip e\fIx\fP
Dispose of errors using mode
.i x .
The values for
.i x
are:
.(b
p	Print error messages (default)
q	No messages, just give exit status
m	Mail back errors
w	Write back errors (mail if user not logged in)
e	Mail back errors and give zero exit stat always
.)b
.ip E\fIfile/message\fP
Prepend error messages with the indicated message.
If it begins with a slash,
it is assumed to be the pathname of a file
containing a message (this is the recommended setting).
Otherwise, it is a literal message.
The error file might contain the name, email address, and/or phone number
of a local postmaster who could provide assistance
in to end users.
If the option is missing or null,
or if it names a file which does not exist or which is not readable,
no message is printed.
.ip f
Save
Unix-style
.q From
lines at the front of headers.
Normally they are assumed redundant
and discarded.
.ip F\fImode\fP
The file mode for queue files.
.ip g\fIn\fP
Set the default group id
for mailers to run in
to
.i n .
.ip G
Allow fuzzy matching on the GECOS field.
If this flag is set,
and the usual user name lookups fail
(that is, there is no alias with this name and a
.i getpwnam
fails),
sequentially search the password file
for a matching entry in the GECOS field.
This also requires that MATCHGECOS
be turned on during compilation.
This option is not recommended.
.ip h\fIN\fP
The maximum hop count.
Messages that have been processed more than
.i N
times are assumed to be in a loop and are rejected.
.ip H\fIfile\fP
Specify the help file
for SMTP.
.ip i
Ignore dots in incoming messages.
.ip I
Insist that the BIND name server be running
to resolve host names.
If this is not set and the name server is not running,
the
.i /etc/hosts
file will be considered complete.
In general, you do want to set this option
if your
.i /etc/hosts
file does not include all hosts known to you
or if you are using the MX (mail forwarding) feature of the BIND name server.
The name server will still be consulted
even if this option is not set, but
.i sendmail
will feel free to resort to reading
.i /etc/hosts
if the name server is not available.
Thus, you should
.i never
set this option if you do not run the name server.
.ip J\fIpath\fP
Set the path for searching for users' .forward files.
The default is
.q $z/.forward .
Some sites that use the automounter may prefer to change this to
.q /var/forward/$u
to search a file with the same name as the user in a system directory.
It can also be set to a sequence of paths separated by colons;
.i sendmail
stops at the first file it can successfully and safely open.
For example,
.q /var/forward/$u:$z/.forward
will search first in /var/forward/\c
.i username
and then in
.i ~username /.forward
(but only if the first file does not exist).
.ip k\fIN\fP
The maximum number of open connections that will be cached at a time.
The default is one.
This delays closing the the current connection until
either this invocation of sendmail needs to connect to another host
or it terminates.
Setting it to zero defaults to the old behavior,
that is, connections are closed immediately.
.ip K\fItimeout\fP
The maximum amount of time a cached connection will be permitted to idle
without activity.
If this time is exceeded,
the connection is immediately closed.
This value should be small (on the order of ten minutes).
Before
.b sendmail
uses a cached connection,
it always sends a NOOP (no operation) command
to check the connection;
if this fails, it reopens the connection.
This keeps your end from failing if the other end times out.
The point of this option is to be a good network neighbor
and avoid using up excessive resources
on the other end.
The default is five minutes.
.ip L\fIn\fP
Set the default log level to
.i n .
.ip m
Send to me too,
even if I am in an alias expansion.
.ip M\fIx\|value\fP
Set the macro
.i x
to
.i value .
This is intended only for use from the command line.
.ip o
Assume that the headers may be in old format,
i.e.,
spaces delimit names.
This actually turns on
an adaptive algorithm:
if any recipient address contains a comma, parenthesis,
or angle bracket,
it will be assumed that commas already exist.
If this flag is not on,
only commas delimit names.
Headers are always output with commas between the names.
.ip P\fIpostmaster\fP
If set,
copies of error messages will be sent to the named
.i postmaster .
Since most errors are user problems,
this is probably not a good idea on large sites,
and arguably contains all sorts of privacy violations,
but it seems to be popular with certain operating systems vendors.
.ip q\fIfactor\fP
Use
.i factor
as the multiplier in the map function
to decide when to just queue up jobs rather than run them.
This value is divided by the difference between the current load average
and the load average limit
(\c
.b x
flag)
to determine the maximum message priority
that will be sent.
Defaults to 10000.
.ip Q\fIdir\fP
Use the named
.i dir
as the queue directory.
.ip r\fItime\fP
Timeout reads after
.i time
interval.
.ip s
Be super-safe when running things,
i.e.,
always instantiate the queue file,
even if you are going to attempt immediate delivery.
.i Sendmail
always instantiates the queue file
before returning control the the client
under any circumstances.
.ip S\fIfile\fP
Log statistics in the named
.i file .
.ip t\fIS,D\fP
Set the local time zone name to
.i S
for standard time and
.i D
for daylight time;
this is only used under version six.
.ip T\fItime\fP
Set the queue timeout to
.i time .
After this interval,
messages that have not been successfully sent
will be returned to the sender.
.ip u\fIn\fP
Set the default userid for mailers to
.i n .
Mailers without the
.i S
flag in the mailer definition
will run as this user.
.ip U\fIudbspec\fP
The user database specification.
.ip v
Run in verbose mode.
.ip w
Asserts that this domain does not have wildcard MX records
in the name server database.
These wildcards can
.q capture
names that are directed outward
and forward them back to your own site.
If there are no wildcards matching your domain,
this option will reduce name server load
and improve performance.
.ip x\fILA\fP
When the system load average exceeds
.i LA ,
just queue messages
(i.e., don't try to send them).
.ip X\fILA\fP
When the system load average exceeds
.i LA ,
refuse incoming SMTP connections.
.ip y\fIfact\fP
The indicated
.i fact or
is added to the priority (thus
.i lowering
the priority of the job)
for each recipient,
i.e., this value penalizes jobs with large numbers of recipients.
.ip Y
If set,
deliver each job that is run from the queue in a separate process.
Use this option if you are short of memory,
since the default tends to consume considerable amounts of memory
while the queue is being processed.
.ip z\fIfact\fP
The indicated
.i fact or
is multiplied by the message class
(determined by the Precedence: field in the user header
and the
.b P
lines in the configuration file)
and subtracted from the priority.
Thus, messages with a higher Priority: will be favored.
.ip Z\fIfact\fP
The
.i fact or
is added to the priority
every time a job is processed.
Thus,
each time a job is processed,
its priority will be decreased by the indicated value.
In most environments this should be positive,
since hosts that are down are all too often down for a long time.
.ip 8
Preserve eight bits of data in the body on input.
Normally the input is stripped to seven bits as per RFC822.
See also the
.b L
mailer flag.
.lp
All options can be specified on the command line using the
\-o flag,
but most will cause
.i sendmail
to relinquish its setuid permissions.
The options that will not cause this are
d, e, E, i, L, m, o, r, s, v, C, and 8.
Also, M (define macro) when defining the r or s macros
is also considered
.q safe .
.sh 3 "T \*- define trusted users"
.pp
Trusted users
are those users who are permitted
to override the sender address
using the
.b \-f
flag.
These typically are
.q root,
.q uucp,
and
.q network,
but on some users it may be convenient
to extend this list to include other users,
perhaps to support
a separate
UUCP
login for each host.
The syntax of this line is:
.(b F
.b T \c
.i user1
.i user2 ...
.)b
There may be more than one of these lines.
.sh 3 "P \*- precedence definitions"
.pp
Values for the
.q "Precedence:"
field may be defined using the
.b P
control line.
The syntax of this field is:
.(b
\fBP\fP\fIname\fP\fB=\fP\fInum\fP
.)b
When the
.i name
is found in a
.q Precedence:
field,
the message class is set to
.i num .
Higher numbers mean higher precedence.
Numbers less than zero
have the special property
that error messages will not be returned.
The default precedence is zero.
For example,
our list of precedences is:
.(b
Pfirst-class=0
Pspecial-delivery=100
Pjunk=\-100
.)b
.sh 3 "V \*- configuration version level"
.pp
To provide compatibility with old configuration files,
the
.b V
line has been added to define some very basic semantics
of the configuration file.
These are not intended to be long term supports;
rather, they describe compatibility features
which will probably be removed in future releases.
.pp
.q Old
configuration files are defined as level one.
Level two files make the following changes:
.np
Host name canonification ($[ ... $])
appends a dot if the name is recognized;
this gives the config file a way of finding out if anything matched.
(Actually, this just initializes the
.q host
map with the
.q \-a.
flag \*- you can reset it to anything you prefer
by declaring the map explicitly.)
.np
Default host name extension is consistent throughout processing;
level one configurations turned off domain extension
(that is, adding the local domain name)
during certain points in processing.
Level two configurations are expected to include a trailing dot
to indicate that the name is already canonical.
.np
Local names that are not aliases
are passed through a new distinguished ruleset five;
this can be used to append a local relay.
This behaviour can be prevented by resolving the local name
with an initial `@'.
That is, something that resolves to a local mailer and a user name of
.q vikki
will be passed through ruleset five,
but a user name of
.q @vikki
will have the `@' stripped,
will not be passed through ruleset five,
but will otherwise be treated the same as the prior example.
The expectation is that this might be used to implement a policy
where mail sent to
.q vikki
was handled by a central hub,
but mail sent to
.q vikki@localhost
was delivered directly.
.pp
Level three files
allow # initiated comments on all lines.
Exceptions are backslash escaped # marks
and the $# syntax.
.sh 3 "K \*- key file declaration"
.pp
Special maps can be defined using the line:
.(b
Kmapname mapclass arguments
.)b
The
.i mapname
is the handle by which this map is referenced in the rewriting rules.
The
.i mapclass
is the name of a type of map;
these are compiled in to sendmail.
The
.i arguments
are interpreted depending on the class;
typically,
there would be a single argument naming the file containing the map.
.pp
Maps are referenced using the syntax:
.(b
$( \fImap\fP \fIkey\fP $@ \fIarguments\fP $: \fIdefault\fP $)
.)b
where either or both of the
.i arguments
or
.i default
portion may be omitted.
The
.i arguments
may appear more than once.
The indicated
.i key
and
.i arguments
are passed to the appropriate mapping function.
If it returns a value, it replaces the input.
If it does not return a value and the
.i default
is specified, the
.i default
replaces the input.
Otherwise, the input is unchanged.
.pp
During replacement of either a map value or default
the string
.q %\fIn\fP
(where
.i n
is a digit)
is replaced by the corresponding
.i argument .
Argument zero
is always the original pattern.
For example, the rule
.(b
.ta 1.5i
R$- ! $+	$: $(uucp $1 $@ $2 $: %1 @ %0 . UUCP $)
.)b
Looks up the UUCP name in a (user defined) UUCP map;
if not found it turns it into
.q \&.UUCP
form.
The database might contain records like:
.(b
decvax	%1@%0.DEC.COM
research	%1@%0.ATT.COM
.)b
.pp
The built in map with both name and class
.q host
is the host name canonicalization lookup.
Thus,
the syntax:
.(b
$(host \fIhostname\fP$)
.)b
is equivalent to:
.(b
$[\fIhostname\fP$]
.)b
.pp
There are four predefined database lookup classes:
.q dbm ,
.q btree ,
.q hash ,
and
.q nis .
The first requires that sendmail be compiled with the
.b ndbm
library;
the second two require the
.b db
library,
and the third requires that sendmail be compiled with NIS support.
All four accept as arguments the some optional flags
and a filename (or a mapname for NIS).
Known flags are:
.ip "\-o"
Indicates that this map is optional \*- that is,
if it cannot be opened,
no error is produced,
and sendmail will behave as if the map existed but was empty.
.ip "\-N"
Normally sendmail does not include the trailing null byte
on a string as part of the key.
If this flag is indicated,
it will be included.
This is for compatibility with some methods of building the maps.
.ip "\-a\fIx\fP"
Append the character
.i x
on successful matches.
For example, the default
.i host
map appends a dot on successful matches.
.ip "\-d\fIdomain\fP"
Use the indicated
.i domain
instead of the default domain.
Used only for NIS maps.
.ip "\-f"
Fold upper to lower case before looking up the key.
.ip "\-m"
Match only (without replacing the value).
If you only care about the existence of a key and not the value
(as you might when searching the NIS map
.q hosts.byname
for example),
this flag prevents the map from substituting the value.
However,
The \-a argument is still appended on a match,
and the default is still taken if the match fails.
.pp
The
.i dbm
map appends the strings
.q \&.pag
and
.q \&.dir
to the given filename;
the two
.i db -based
maps do not.
.pp
The program
.i makemap (8)
can be used to build any of the three database-oriented maps.
It takes the following flags:
.ip \-f
Fold upper to lower case in the map.
.ip \-N
Include null bytes in keys.
.ip \-o
Append to an existing (old) file.
.ip \-r
Allow replacement of existing keys;
normally, re-inserting an existing key is an error.
.ip \-v
Print what is happening.
.pp
New classes can be added in the routine
.b setupmaps
in file
.b conf.c .
.sh 2 "Building a Configuration File From Scratch"
.pp
Building a configuration table from scratch is an extremely difficult job.
Fortunately,
it is almost never necessary to do so;
nearly every situation that may come up
may be resolved by changing an existing table.
In any case,
it is critical that you understand what it is that you are trying to do
and come up with a philosophy for the configuration table.
This section is intended to explain what the real purpose
of a configuration table is
and to give you some ideas
for what your philosophy might be.
.sh 3 "What you are trying to do"
.pp
The configuration table has three major purposes.
The first and simplest
is to set up the environment for
.i sendmail .
This involves setting the options,
defining a few critical macros,
etc.
Since these are described in other places,
we will not go into more detail here.
.pp
The second purpose is to rewrite addresses in the message.
This should typically be done in two phases.
The first phase maps addresses in any format
into a canonical form.
This should be done in ruleset three.
The second phase maps this canonical form
into the syntax appropriate for the receiving mailer.
.i Sendmail
does this in three subphases.
Rulesets one and two
are applied to all sender and recipient addresses respectively.
After this,
you may specify per-mailer rulesets
for both sender and recipient addresses;
this allows mailer-specific customization.
Finally,
ruleset four is applied to do any default conversion
to external form.
.pp
The third purpose
is to map addresses into the actual set of instructions
necessary to get the message delivered.
Ruleset zero must resolve to the internal form,
which is in turn used as a pointer to a mailer descriptor.
The mailer descriptor describes the interface requirements
of the mailer.
.sh 3 "Philosophy"
.pp
The particular philosophy you choose will depend heavily
on the size and structure of your organization.
I will present a few possible philosophies here.
.pp
One general point applies to all of these philosophies:
it is almost always a mistake
to try to do full name resolution.
For example,
if you are trying to get names of the form
.q user@host
to the Arpanet,
it does not pay to route them to
.q xyzvax!decvax!ucbvax!c70:user@host
since you then depend on several links not under your control.
The best approach to this problem
is to simply forward to
.q xyzvax!user@host
and let xyzvax
worry about it from there.
In summary,
just get the message closer to the destination,
rather than determining the full path.
.sh 4 "Large site, many hosts \*- minimum information"
.pp
Berkeley is an example of a large site,
i.e., more than two or three hosts
and multiple mail connections.
We have decided that the only reasonable philosophy
in our environment
is to designate one host as the guru for our site.
It must be able to resolve any piece of mail it receives.
The other sites should have the minimum amount of information
they can get away with.
In addition,
any information they do have
should be hints rather than solid information.
.pp
For example,
a typical site on our local ether network is
.q monet.
When monet receives mail for delivery,
it checks whether it knows
that the destination host is directly reachable;
if so, mail is sent to that host.
If it receives mail for any unknown host,
it just passes it directly to
.q ucbvax,
our master host.
Ucbvax may determine that the host name is illegal
and reject the message,
or may be able to do delivery.
However, it is important to note that when a new mail connection is added,
the only host that
.i must
have its tables updated
is ucbvax;
the others
.i may
be updated if convenient,
but this is not critical.
.pp
This picture is slightly muddied
due to network connections that are not actually located
on ucbvax.
For example,
some UUCP connections are currently on
.q ucbarpa.
However,
monet
.i "does not"
know about this;
the information is hidden totally between ucbvax and ucbarpa.
Mail going from monet to a UUCP host
is transferred via the ethernet
from monet to ucbvax,
then via the ethernet from ucbvax to ucbarpa,
and then is submitted to UUCP.
Although this involves some extra hops,
we feel this is an acceptable tradeoff.
.pp
An interesting point is that it would be possible
to update monet
to send appropriate UUCP mail directly to ucbarpa
if the load got too high;
if monet failed to note a host as connected to ucbarpa
it would go via ucbvax as before,
and if monet incorrectly sent a message to ucbarpa
it would still be sent by ucbarpa
to ucbvax as before.
The only problem that can occur is loops,
for example,
if ucbarpa thought that ucbvax had the UUCP connection
and vice versa.
For this reason,
updates should
.i always
happen to the master host first.
.pp
This philosophy results as much from the need
to have a single source for the configuration files
(typically built using
.i m4 \|(1)
or some similar tool)
as any logical need.
Maintaining more than three separate tables by hand
is essentially an impossible job.
.sh 4 "Small site \*- complete information"
.pp
A small site
(two or three hosts and few external connections)
may find it more reasonable to have complete information
at each host.
This would require that each host
know exactly where each network connection is,
possibly including the names of each host on that network.
As long as the site remains small
and the the configuration remains relatively static,
the update problem will probably not be too great.
.sh 4 "Single host"
.pp
This is in some sense the trivial case.
The only major issue is trying to insure that you don't
have to know too much about your environment.
For example,
if you have a UUCP connection
you might find it useful to know about the names of hosts
connected directly to you,
but this is really not necessary
since this may be determined from the syntax.
.sh 3 "Relevant issues"
.pp
The canonical form you use
should almost certainly be as specified in
the Arpanet protocols
RFC819 and RFC822.
Copies of these RFC's are included on the
.i sendmail
tape
as
.i doc/rfc819.lpr
and
.i doc/rfc822.lpr .
.pp
RFC822
describes the format of the mail message itself.
.i Sendmail
follows this RFC closely,
to the extent that many of the standards described in this document
can not be changed without changing the code.
In particular,
the following characters have special interpretations:
.(b
< > ( ) " \e
.)b
Any attempt to use these characters for other than their RFC822
purpose in addresses is probably doomed to disaster.
.pp
RFC819
describes the specifics of the domain-based addressing.
This is touched on in RFC822 as well.
Essentially each host is given a name
which is a right-to-left dot qualified pseudo-path
from a distinguished root.
The elements of the path need not be physical hosts;
the domain is logical rather than physical.
For example,
at Berkeley
one legal host might be
.q a.CC.Berkeley.EDU ;
reading from right to left,
.q EDU
is a top level domain
comprising educational institutions,
.q Berkeley
is a logical domain name,
.q CC
represents the Computer Center,
(in this case a strictly logical entity),
and
.q a
is a host in the Computer Center.
.pp
Beware when reading RFC819
that there are a number of errors in it.
.sh 3 "How to proceed"
.pp
Once you have decided on a philosophy,
it is worth examining the available configuration tables
to decide if any of them are close enough
to steal major parts of.
Even under the worst of conditions,
there is a fair amount of boiler plate that can be collected safely.
.pp
The next step is to build ruleset three.
This will be the hardest part of the job.
Beware of doing too much to the address in this ruleset,
since anything you do will reflect through
to the message.
In particular,
stripping of local domains is best deferred,
since this can leave you with addresses with no domain spec at all.
Since
.i sendmail
likes to append the sending domain to addresses with no domain,
this can change the semantics of addresses.
Also try to avoid
fully qualifying domains in this ruleset.
Although technically legal,
this can lead to unpleasantly and unnecessarily long addresses
reflected into messages.
The Berkeley configuration files
define ruleset nine
to qualify domain names and strip local domains.
This is called from ruleset zero
to get all addresses into a cleaner form.
.pp
Once you have ruleset three finished,
the other rulesets should be relatively trivial.
If you need hints,
examine the supplied configuration tables.
.sh 3 "Testing the rewriting rules \*- the \-bt flag"
.pp
When you build a configuration table,
you can do a certain amount of testing
using the
.q "test mode"
of
.i sendmail .
For example,
you could invoke
.i sendmail
as:
.(b
sendmail \-bt \-Ctest.cf
.)b
which would read the configuration file
.q test.cf
and enter test mode.
In this mode,
you enter lines of the form:
.(b
rwset address
.)b
where
.i rwset
is the rewriting set you want to use
and
.i address
is an address to apply the set to.
Test mode shows you the steps it takes
as it proceeds,
finally showing you the address it ends up with.
You may use a comma separated list of rwsets
for sequential application of rules to an input;
ruleset three is always applied first.
For example:
.(b
1,21,4 monet:bollard
.)b
first applies ruleset three to the input
.q monet:bollard.
Ruleset one is then applied to the output of ruleset three,
followed similarly by rulesets twenty-one and four.
.pp
If you need more detail,
you can also use the
.q \-d21
flag to turn on more debugging.
For example,
.(b
sendmail \-bt \-d21.99
.)b
turns on an incredible amount of information;
a single word address
is probably going to print out several pages worth of information.
.sh 3 "Building mailer descriptions"
.pp
To add an outgoing mailer to your mail system,
you will have to define the characteristics of the mailer.
.pp
Each mailer must have an internal name.
This can be arbitrary,
except that the names
.q local
and
.q prog
must be defined.
.pp
The pathname of the mailer must be given in the P field.
If this mailer should be accessed via an IPC connection,
use the string
.q [IPC]
instead.
.pp
The F field defines the mailer flags.
You should specify an
.q f
or
.q r
flag to pass the name of the sender as a
.b \-f
or
.b \-r
flag respectively.
These flags are only passed if they were passed to
.i sendmail,
so that mailers that give errors under some circumstances
can be placated.
If the mailer is not picky
you can just specify
.q "\-f $g"
in the argv template.
If the mailer must be called as
.b root
the
.q S
flag should be given;
this will not reset the userid
before calling the mailer\**.
.(f
\**\c
.i Sendmail
must be running setuid to root
for this to work.
.)f
If this mailer is local
(i.e., will perform final delivery
rather than another network hop)
the
.q l
flag should be given.
Quote characters
(backslashes and " marks)
can be stripped from addresses if the
.q s
flag is specified;
if this is not given
they are passed through.
If the mailer is capable of sending to more than one user
on the same host
in a single transaction
the
.q m
flag should be stated.
If this flag is on,
then the argv template containing
.b $u
will be repeated for each unique user
on a given host.
The
.q e
flag will mark the mailer as being
.q expensive,
which will cause
.i sendmail
to defer connection
until a queue run\**.
.(f
\**The
.q c
configuration option must be given
for this to be effective.
.)f
.pp
An unusual case is the
.q C
flag.
This flag applies to the mailer that the message is received from,
rather than the mailer being sent to;
if set,
the domain spec of the sender
(i.e., the
.q @host.domain
part)
is saved
and is appended to any addresses in the message
that do not already contain a domain spec.
For example,
a message of the form:
.(b
From: eric@ucbarpa
To: wnj@monet, mckusick
.)b
will be modified to:
.(b
From: eric@ucbarpa
To: wnj@monet, mckusick@ucbarpa
.)b
.i "if and only if"
the
.q C
flag is defined in the mailer corresponding to
.q eric@ucbarpa.
.pp
Other flags are described
in Appendix C.
.pp
The S and R fields in the mailer description
are per-mailer rewriting sets
to be applied to sender and recipient addresses
respectively.
These are applied after the sending domain is appended
and the general rewriting sets
(numbers one and two)
are applied,
but before the output rewrite
(ruleset four)
is applied.
A typical use is to append the current domain
to addresses that do not already have a domain.
For example,
a header of the form:
.(b
From: eric
.)b
might be changed to be:
.(b
From: eric@ucbarpa
.)b
or
.(b
From: ucbvax!eric
.)b
depending on the domain it is being shipped into.
These sets can also be used
to do special purpose output rewriting
in cooperation with ruleset four.
.pp
The E field defines the string to use
as an end-of-line indication.
A string containing only newline is the default.
The usual backslash escapes
(\er, \en, \ef, \eb)
may be used.
.pp
Finally,
an argv template is given as the E field.
It may have embedded spaces.
If there is no argv with a
.b $u
macro in it,
.i sendmail
will speak SMTP
to the mailer.
If the pathname for this mailer is
.q [IPC],
the argv should be
.(b
IPC $h [ \fIport\fP ]
.)b
where
.i port
is the optional port number
to connect to.
.pp
For example,
the specifications:
.(b
.ta \w'Mlocal, 'u +\w'P=/bin/mail, 'u +\w'F=rlsm, 'u +\w'S=10, 'u +\w'R=20, 'u
Mlocal,	P=/bin/mail,	F=rlsm	S=10,	R=20,	A=mail \-d $u
Mether,	P=[IPC],	F=meC,	S=11,	R=21,	A=IPC $h, M=100000
.)b
specifies a mailer to do local delivery
and a mailer for ethernet delivery.
The first is called
.q local,
is located in the file
.q /bin/mail,
takes a picky
.b \-r
flag,
does local delivery,
quotes should be stripped from addresses,
and multiple users can be delivered at once;
ruleset ten
should be applied to sender addresses in the message
and ruleset twenty
should be applied to recipient addresses;
the argv to send to a message will be the word
.q mail,
the word
.q \-d,
and words containing the name of the receiving user.
If a
.b \-r
flag is inserted
it will be between the words
.q mail
and
.q \-d.
The second mailer is called
.q ether,
it should be connected to via an IPC connection,
it can handle multiple users at once,
connections should be deferred,
and any domain from the sender address
should be appended to any receiver name
without a domain;
sender addresses should be processed by ruleset eleven
and recipient addresses by ruleset twenty-one.
There is a 100,000 byte limit on messages passed through this mailer.
.sh 2 "The User Database"
.pp
If you have a version of sendmail with the user database package
compiled in,
the handling of sender and recipient addresses
is modified.
.pp
The location of this database is controlled with the
.b U
option.
.sh 3 "Structure of the user database"
.pp
The database is a sorted (BTree-based) structure.
User records are stored with the key:
.(b
\fIuser-name\fP\fB:\fP\fIfield-name\fP
.)b
The sorted database format ensures that user records are clustered together.
Meta-information is always stored with a leading colon.
.pp
Field names define both the syntax and semantics of the value.
Defined fields include:
.nr ii 1i
.ip maildrop
The delivery address for this user.
There may be multiple values of this record.
In particular,
mailing lists will have one
.i maildrop
record for each user on the list.
.ip "mailname"
The outgoing mailname for this user.
For each outgoing name,
there should be an appropriate
.i maildrop
record for that name to allow return mail.
See also
.i :default:mailname .
.ip fullname
The full name of the user.
.ip office-address
The office address for this user.
.ip office-phone
The office phone number for this user.
.ip office-fax
The office FAX number for this user.
.ip home-address
The home address for this user.
.ip home-phone
The home phone number for this user.
.ip home-fax
The home FAX number for this user.
.ip project
A (short) description of the project this person is affiliated with.
In the University this is often just the name of their graduate advisor.
.ip plan
A pointer to a file from which plan information can be gathered.
.pp
As of this writing,
only a few of these fields are actually being used by sendmail:
.i maildrop
and
.i mailname .
A
.i finger
program that uses the other fields is planned.
.sh 3 "User database semantics"
.pp
When the rewriting rules submit an address to the local mailer,
the user name is passed through the alias file.
If no alias is found (or if the alias points back to the same address),
the name (with
.q :maildrop
appended)
is then used as a key in the user database.
If no match occurs (or if the maildrop points at the same address),
forwarding is tried.
.pp
If the first token of the user name returned by ruleset 0
is an
.q @
sign, the user database lookup is skipped.
The intent is that the user database will act as a set of defaults
for a cluster (in our case, the Computer Science Division);
mail sent to a specific machine should ignore these defaults.
.pp
When mail is sent,
the name of the sending user is looked up in the database.
If that user has a
.q mailname
record,
the value of that record is used as their outgoing name.
For example, I might have a record:
.(b
eric:mailname	Eric.Allman@CS.Berkeley.EDU
.)b
This would cause my outgoing mail to be sent as Eric.Allman.
.pp
If a
.q maildrop
is found for the user,
but no corresponding
.q maildrop
record exists,
the record
.q :default:mailname
is consulted.
If present, this is the name of a host to override the local host.
For example, in our case we would set it to
.q CS.Berkeley.EDU .
The effect is that anyone known in the database
gets their outgoing mail stamped as
.q user@CS.Berkeley.EDU ,
but people not listed in the database use the local hostname.
.sh 1 "OTHER CONFIGURATION"
.pp
There are some configuration changes that can be made by
recompiling
.i sendmail .
This section describes what changes can be made
and what has to be modified to make them.
.sh 2 "Parameters in src/Makefile"
.pp
These parameters are not intended to describe site policy;
these should be defined in src/conf.h.
.ip DBM
If set,
the
.q DBM
package in UNIX is used
(see
.i dbm(3X)
in the UNIX Programmer's Manual).
If not set,
a much less efficient algorithm for processing aliases is used.
.ip NDBM
If set,
the new version of the DBM library
that allows multiple databases will be used.
.q DBM
must also be set.
.ip NEWDB
If set, use the new database package from Berkeley (from 4.4BSD).
This package is substantially faster than DBM or NDBM.
If NEWDB and DBM are both set,
sendmail will read old DBM files,
but will create and use NEWDB files.
.ip LOCKF
Use System V
.b lockf
instead of Berkeley
.b flock .
Due to brain damage in
.b lockf ,
this should never be used unless absolutely necessary.
.ip SYS5TZ
Use System V
time zone semantics.
.ip SYSTEM5
Set all of the compilation parameters appropriate for System V.
.ip LA_TYPE
The load average type.
Details are described below.
.lp
The are four built-in ways of computing the load average.
.i Sendmail
tries to auto-configure them based on imperfect guesses;
you can select one using the
.i cc
option
.b \-DLA_TYPE= \c
.i type ,
where
.i type
is:
.ip LA_INT
The kernel stores the load average in the kernel as an array of long integers.
The actual values are scaled by a factor FSCALE
(default 256).
.ip LA_FLOAT
The kernel stores the load average in the kernel as an array of
double precision floats.
.ip LA_SUBR
Call the
.i getloadavg
routine to get the load average as an array of doubles.
.ip LA_ZERO
Always return zero as the load average.
This is the fallback case.
.lp
If type
.sm LA_INT
or
.sm LA_FLOAT
is specified,
you may also need to specify
.sm _PATH_UNIX
(the path to your system binary)
and
.sm LA_AVENRUN
(the name of the variable containing the load average in the kernel;
usually
.q _avenrun
or
.q avenrun ).
.sh 2 "Parameters in src/conf.h"
.pp
Parameters and compilation options
are defined in conf.h.
Most of these need not normally be tweaked;
common parameters are all in sendmail.cf.
However, the sizes of certain primitive vectors, etc.,
are included in this file.
The numbers following the parameters
are their default value.
.nr ii 1.2i
.ip "MAXLINE [1024]"
The maximum line length of any input line.
If message lines exceed this length
they will still be processed correctly;
however, header lines,
configuration file lines,
alias lines,
etc.,
must fit within this limit.
.ip "MAXNAME [256]"
The maximum length of any name,
such as a host or a user name.
.ip "MAXPV [40]"
The maximum number of parameters to any mailer.
This limits the number of recipients that may be passed in one transaction.
It can be set to any arbitrary number above about 10,
since
.i sendmail
will break up a delivery into smaller batches as needed.
A higher number may reduce load on your system, however.
.ip "MAXATOM [100]"
The maximum number of atoms
(tokens)
in a single address.
For example,
the address
.q "eric@CS.Berkeley.EDU"
is seven atoms.
.ip "MAXMAILERS [25]"
The maximum number of mailers that may be defined
in the configuration file.
.ip "MAXRWSETS [100]"
The maximum number of rewriting sets
that may be defined.
.ip "MAXPRIORITIES [25]"
The maximum number of values for the
.q Precedence:
field that may be defined
(using the
.b P
line in sendmail.cf).
.ip "MAXTRUST [30]"
The maximum number of trusted users that may be defined
(using the
.b T
line in sendmail.cf).
.ip "MAXUSERENVIRON [40]"
The maximum number of items in the user environment
that will be passed to subordinate mailers.
.ip "QUEUESIZE [1000]"
The maximum number of entries that will be processed
in a single queue run.
.ip "MAXMXHOSTS [20]"
The maximum number of MX records we will accept for any single host.
.lp
A number of other compilation options exist.
These specify whether or not specific code should be compiled in.
.nr ii 1.2i
.ip DEBUG
If set, debugging information is compiled in.
To actually get the debugging output,
the
.b \-d
flag must be used.
.b "WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT THIS BE LEFT ON."
Some people, believing that it was a security hole
(it was, once)
have turned it off and thus crippled debuggers.
.ip DAEMON
If set,
code to run a daemon is compiled in.
This code is for 4.2 or 4.3BSD.
.ip LOG
If set,
the
.i syslog
routine in use at some sites is used.
This makes an informational log record
for each message processed,
and makes a higher priority log record
for internal system errors.
.ip MATCHGECOS
Compile in the code to do ``fuzzy matching'' on the GECOS field
in /etc/passwd.
This also requires that option G be turned on.
.ip NAMED_BIND
Compile in code to use the
Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) server
to resolve TCP/IP host names.
.ip NOTUNIX
If you are using a non-UNIX mail format,
you can set this flag to turn off special processing
of UNIX-style
.q "From "
lines.
.ip QUEUE
This flag should be set to compile in the queueing code.
If this is not set,
mailers must accept the mail immediately
or it will be returned to the sender.
.ip SETPROCTITLE
If defined,
.i sendmail
will change its
.i argv
array to indicate its current status.
This can be used in conjunction with the
.i ps
command to find out just what it's up to.
.ip SMTP
If set,
the code to handle user and server SMTP will be compiled in.
This is only necessary if your machine has some mailer
that speaks SMTP
(this means most machines everywhere).
.ip UGLYUUCP
If you have a UUCP host adjacent to you which is not running
a reasonable version of
.i rmail ,
you will have to set this flag to include the
.q "remote from sysname"
info on the from line.
Otherwise, UUCP gets confused about where the mail came from.
.ip USERDB
Include the
.b experimental
Berkeley user information database package.
This adds a new level of local name expansion
between aliasing and forwarding.
It also uses the NEWDB package.
This may change in future releases.
.sh 2 "Configuration in src/conf.c"
.pp
The following changes can be made in conf.c.
.sh 3 "Built-in Header Semantics"
.pp
Not all header semantics are defined in the configuration file.
Header lines that should only be included by certain mailers
(as well as other more obscure semantics)
must be specified in the
.i HdrInfo
table in
.i conf.c .
This table contains the header name
(which should be in all lower case)
and a set of header control flags (described below),
The flags are:
.ip H_ACHECK
Normally when the check is made to see if a header line is compatible
with a mailer,
.i sendmail
will not delete an existing line.
If this flag is set,
.i sendmail
will delete
even existing header lines.
That is,
if this bit is set and the mailer does not have flag bits set
that intersect with the required mailer flags
in the header definition in
sendmail.cf,
the header line is
.i always
deleted.
.ip H_EOH
If this header field is set,
treat it like a blank line,
i.e.,
it will signal the end of the header
and the beginning of the message text.
.ip H_FORCE
Add this header entry
even if one existed in the message before.
If a header entry does not have this bit set,
.i sendmail
will not add another header line if a header line
of this name already existed.
This would normally be used to stamp the message
by everyone who handled it.
.ip H_TRACE
If set,
this is a timestamp
(trace)
field.
If the number of trace fields in a message
exceeds a preset amount
the message is returned
on the assumption that it has an aliasing loop.
.ip H_RCPT
If set,
this field contains recipient addresses.
This is used by the
.b \-t
flag to determine who to send to
when it is collecting recipients from the message.
.ip H_FROM
This flag indicates that this field
specifies a sender.
The order of these fields in the
.i HdrInfo
table specifies
.i sendmail's
preference
for which field to return error messages to.
.nr ii 5n
.lp
Let's look at a sample
.i HdrInfo
specification:
.(b
.ta 4n +\w'"return-receipt-to",  'u
struct hdrinfo	HdrInfo[] =
\&{
	     /* originator fields, most to least significant  */
	"resent-sender",	H_FROM,
	"resent-from",	H_FROM,
	"sender",	H_FROM,
	"from",	H_FROM,
	"full-name",	H_ACHECK,
	     /* destination fields */
	"to",	H_RCPT,
	"resent-to",	H_RCPT,
	"cc",	H_RCPT,
	     /* message identification and control */
	"message",	H_EOH,
	"text",	H_EOH,
	     /* trace fields */
	"received",	H_TRACE|H_FORCE,

	NULL,	0,
};
.)b
This structure indicates that the
.q To: ,
.q Resent-To: ,
and
.q Cc:
fields
all specify recipient addresses.
Any
.q Full-Name:
field will be deleted unless the required mailer flag
(indicated in the configuration file)
is specified.
The
.q Message:
and
.q Text:
fields will terminate the header;
these are used by random dissenters around the network world.
The
.q Received:
field will always be added,
and can be used to trace messages.
.pp
There are a number of important points here.
First,
header fields are not added automatically just because they are in the
.i HdrInfo
structure;
they must be specified in the configuration file
in order to be added to the message.
Any header fields mentioned in the configuration file but not
mentioned in the
.i HdrInfo
structure have default processing performed;
that is,
they are added unless they were in the message already.
Second,
the
.i HdrInfo
structure only specifies cliched processing;
certain headers are processed specially by ad hoc code
regardless of the status specified in
.i HdrInfo .
For example,
the
.q Sender:
and
.q From:
fields are always scanned on ARPANET mail
to determine the sender;
this is used to perform the
.q "return to sender"
function.
The
.q "From:"
and
.q "Full-Name:"
fields are used to determine the full name of the sender
if possible;
this is stored in the macro
.b $x
and used in a number of ways.
.sh 3 "SMTP Reply Codes"
.pp
The file
.i conf.c
also contains the specification of ARPANET reply codes.
There are four classifications these fall into:
.(b
.sz -1
.ta \w'char  'u +\w'Arpa_TUsrerr[] =  'u +\w'"888";  'u
char	Arpa_Info[] =	"050";	/* arbitrary info */
char	Arpa_TSyserr[] =	"455";	/* some (transient) system error */
char	Arpa_PSyserr[] =	"554";	/* some (permanent) system error */
char	Arpa_Usrerr[] =	"554";	/* some (fatal) user error */
.sz
.)b
The class
.i Arpa_Info
is for any information that is not required by the protocol,
such as forwarding information.
.i Arpa_TSyserr
and
.i Arpa_PSyserr
is printed by the
.i syserr
routine.
TSyserr
is printed out for transient errors,
that is,
errors that are likely to go away without explicit action
on the part of a systems administrator.
PSyserr
is printed for permanent errors.
The distinction is made based on the value of
.i errno .
Finally,
.i Arpa_Usrerr
is the result of a user error
and is generated by the
.i usrerr
routine;
these are generated when the user has specified something wrong,
and hence the error is permanent,
i.e.,
it will not work simply by resubmitting the request.
.sh 3 "Restricting Use of Email"
.pp
If it is necessary to restrict mail through a relay,
the
.i checkcompat
routine can be modified.
This routine is called for every recipient address.
It can return
.b TRUE
to indicate that the address is acceptable
and mail processing will continue,
or it can return
.b FALSE
to reject the recipient.
If it returns false,
it is up to
.i checkcompat
to print an error message
(using
.i usrerr )
saying why the message is rejected.
For example,
.i checkcompat
could read:
.(b
.re
.sz -1
.ta 4n +4n +4n +4n +4n +4n +4n
bool
checkcompat(to)
	register ADDRESS *to;
\&{
	if (MsgSize > 50000 && to->q_mailer != LocalMailer)
	{
		usrerr("Message too large for non-local delivery");
		NoReturn = TRUE;
		return (FALSE);
	}
	return (TRUE);
}
.sz
.)b
This would reject messages greater than 50000 bytes
unless they were local.
The
.i NoReturn
flag can be sent to suppress the return of the actual body
of the message in the error return.
The actual use of this routine is highly dependent on the
implementation,
and use should be limited.
.sh 3 "Load Average Computation"
.pp
The routine
.i getla
should return an approximation of the current system load average
as an integer.
There are four versions included on compilation flags
as described above.
.sh 3 "New Database Map Classes"
.pp
New key maps can be added by creating a class initialization function
and a lookup function.
These are then added to the routine
.i setupmaps.
.pp
The initialization function is called as
.(b
\fIxxx\fP_map_init(MAP *map, char *mapname, char *args)
.)b
The
.i map
is an internal data structure.
The
.i mapname
is the name of the map (used for error messages).
The
.i args
is a pointer to the rest of the configuration file line;
flags and filenames can be extracted from this line.
The initialization function must return
.sm TRUE
if it successfully opened the map,
.sm FALSE
otherwise.
.pp
The lookup function is called as
.(b
\fIxxx\fP_map_lookup(MAP *map, char buf[], int bufsize, char **av)
.)b
The
.i map
defines the map internally.
The parameters
.i buf
and
.i bufsize
have the input key.
This may be (and often is) used destructively.
The
.i av
is a list of arguments passed in from the rewrite line.
The lookup function should return a pointer to the new value.
.sh 2 "Configuration in src/daemon.c"
.pp
The file
.i src/daemon.c
contains a number of routines that are dependent
on the local networking environment.
The version supplied is specific to 4.3 BSD.
.pp
In previous releases,
we recommended that you modify the routine
.i maphostname
if you wanted to generalize
.b $[
\&...\&
.b $]
lookups.
We now recommend that you create a new keyed map instead.
.sh 1 "CHANGES IN RELEASE 6"
.pp
The following summarizes changes
since the last commonly available version of
.b sendmail
(5.67):
.sh 2 "Connection Caching"
.pp
Instead of closing SMTP connections immediately,
those connections are cached for possible future use.
The advent of MX records made this effective for mailing lists;
in addition,
substantial performance improvements can be expected for queue processing.
.sh 2 "Eight-Bit Clean"
.pp
Previous versions of
.b sendmail
used the 0200 bit for quoting.
This version avoids that use.
However, for compatibility with RFC 822,
the default is still to strip the eighth bit;
set option `8' to get full 8-bit clean processing.
.pp
Individual mailers can still produce seven bit out put using the
`7' mailer flag.
.sh 2 "User Database"
.pp
The user database is an as-yet experimental attempt
to provide unified large-site name support.
We are installing it at Berkeley;
future versions may show significant modifications.
.sh 2 "Improved BIND Support"
.pp
The BIND support,
particularly for MX records,
had a number of annoying
.q features
which have been removed in this release.
In particular,
these more tightly bind (pun intended) the name server to sendmail,
so that the name server resolution rules are incorporated directly into
.b sendmail .
.sh 2 "Keyed Files"
.pp
Generalized keyed files is an idea taken directly from
.sm IDA
.b sendmail
(albeit with a completely different implementation).
They can be useful on large sites.
.pp
R6 also understands YP.
.sh 2 "Parsing Bug Fixes"
.pp
A number of small bugs having to do with things like
backslash-escaped quotes inside of comments
have been fixed.
.sh 2 "Separate From/Return-Path Processing"
.pp
Since the From: line is passed in separately from the envelope sender,
these have both been made visible;
the
.b $<
macro gives access to the envelope sender information.
.sh 2 "Dynamic Header Allocation"
.pp
The fixed size limit on header lines has been eliminated.
.sh 2 "New Command Line Flag"
.pp
The \-p flag has been added
to pass in protocol information.
.sh 2 "New Options"
.pp
Several new options have been added,
many to support new features,
others to allow tuning that was previously available
only by recompiling.
They are described in detail in Section 5.1.5.
Briefly,
.ip C
Set checkpoint interval.
.ip E
Default error message.
.ip G
Enable GECOS matching.
.ip h
Maximum hop count.
.ip J
Forward file path.
.ip k
Connection cache size
.ip K
Connection cache lifetime.
.ip U
User database spec.
.ip w
Domain has no wildcard MX.
.ip 8
Run eight bit clean.
.sh 2 "Bigger Defaults"
.pp
Release 6 allows up to 100 rulesets instead of 30.
It is recommended that rulesets 0\-9 be reserved for
.i sendmail 's
dedicated use in future releases.
.pp
The total number of MX records that can be used has been raised to 20.
.pp
The number of queued messages that can be handled at one time
has been raised from 600 to 1000.
.sh 2 "Auto-Quoting in Addresses"
.pp
Previously, the
.q "Full Name <email address>"
syntax would generate incorrect protocol output
if
.q "Full Name"
had special characters such as dot.
This version puts quotes around such names.
.sh 2 "Symbolic Names On Error Mailer"
.pp
Several names have been built in to the $@ portion of the $#error
mailer.
.sh 2 "Portability and Security Enhancements"
.pp
A number of internal changes have been made to enhance portability.
.pp
Several fixes have been made to increase the paranoia factor.
.++ A
.+c "COMMAND LINE FLAGS"
.ba 0
.nr ii 1i
.pp
Arguments must be presented with flags before addresses.
The flags are:
.ip \-b\fIx\fP
Set operation mode to
.i x .
Operation modes are:
.(b
.ta 4n
m	Deliver mail (default)
s	Speak SMTP on input side
d	Run as a daemon
t	Run in test mode
v	Just verify addresses, don't collect or deliver
i	Initialize the alias database
p	Print the mail queue
z	Freeze the configuration file
.)b
.ip \-C\fIfile\fP
Use a different configuration file.
.i Sendmail
runs as the invoking user (rather than root)
when this flag is specified.
.ip \-d\fIlevel\fP
Set debugging level.
.ip "\-f\ \fIaddr\fP"
The sender's machine address is
.i addr .
This flag is ignored unless the real user
is listed as a
.q "trusted user"
or if
.i addr
contains an exclamation point
(because of certain restrictions in UUCP).
.ip \-F\fIname\fP
Sets the full name of this user to
.i name .
.ip "\-h\ \fIcnt\fP"
Sets the
.q "hop count"
to
.i cnt .
This represents the number of times this message has been processed
by
.i sendmail
(to the extent that it is supported by the underlying networks).
.i Cnt
is incremented during processing,
and if it reaches
MAXHOP
(currently 30)
.i sendmail
throws away the message with an error.
.ip \-n
Don't do aliasing or forwarding.
.ip "\-r\ \fIaddr\fP"
An obsolete form of
.b \-f .
.ip \-o\fIx\|value\fP
Set option
.i x
to the specified
.i value .
These options are described in Appendix B.
.ip \-p\fIprotocol\fP
Set the sending protocol.
Programs are encouraged to set this.
The protocol field can be in the form
.i protocol \c
.b : \c
.i host
to set both the sending protocol and sending host.
For example,
.q \-pUUCP:uunet
sets the sending protocol to UUCP
and the sending host to uunet.
(Some existing programs use \-oM to set the r and s macros;
this is equivalent to using \-p.)
.ip \-q\fItime\fP
Try to process the queued up mail.
If the time is given,
a sendmail will run through the queue at the specified interval
to deliver queued mail;
otherwise, it only runs once.
.ip \-t
Read the header for
.q To: ,
.q Cc: ,
and
.q Bcc:
lines, and send to everyone listed in those lists.
The
.q Bcc:
line will be deleted before sending.
Any addresses in the argument vector will be deleted
from the send list.
.pp
There are a number of options that may be specified as
primitive flags
(provided for compatibility with
.i delivermail ).
These are the e, i, m, and v options.
Also,
the f option
may be specified as the
.b \-s
flag.
.+c "QUEUE FILE FORMATS"
.pp
This appendix describes the format of the queue files.
These files live in the directory defined by the
.b Q
option in the
.i sendmail.cf
file, usually
.i /var/spool/mqueue
or
.i /usr/spool/mqueue .
.pp
All queue files have the name
\fIx\fP\|\fBf\fP\fIAA99999\fP
where
.i AA99999
is the
.i id
for this message
and the
.i x
is a type.
All files with the same id collectively define one message.
.pp
The types are:
.nr ii 0.5i
.ip d
The data file.
The message body (excluding the header) is kept in this file.
.ip l
The lock file.
If this file exists,
the job is currently being processed,
and a queue run will not process the file.
For that reason,
an extraneous
.b lf
file can cause a job to apparently disappear
(it will not even time out!).
[Actually, this file is obsolete on most systems that support the
.b flock
or
.b lockf
system calls.]
.ip n
This file is created when an id is being created.
It is a separate file to insure that no mail can ever be destroyed
due to a race condition.
It should exist for no more than a few milliseconds
at any given time.
[This is only used on old versions of
sendmail;
it is not used 
on newer versions.]
.ip q
The queue control file.
This file contains the information necessary to process the job.
.ip t
A temporary file.
These are an image of the
.b qf
file when it is being rebuilt.
It should be renamed to a
.b qf
file very quickly.
.ip x
A transcript file,
existing during the life of a session
showing everything that happens
during that session.
.pp
The
.b qf
file is structured as a series of lines
each beginning with a code letter.
The lines are as follows:
.ip D
The name of the data file.
There may only be one of these lines.
.ip H
A header definition.
There may be any number of these lines.
The order is important:
they represent the order in the final message.
These use the same syntax
as header definitions in the configuration file.
.ip C
The controlling address.
Recipient addresses following this line
will be flagged as having resulted from an alias of this name.
This affect the actual UNIX user id used for delivery.
.ip R
A recipient address.
This will normally be completely aliased,
but is actually realiased when the job is processed.
There will be one line
for each recipient.
.ip S
The sender address.
There may only be one of these lines.
.ip E
An error address.
If any such lines exist,
they represent the addresses that should receive error messages.
.ip T
The job creation time.
This is used to compute when to time out the job.
.ip P
The current message priority.
This is used to order the queue.
Higher numbers mean lower priorities.
The priority changes
as the message sits in the queue.
The initial priority depends on the message class
and the size of the message.
.ip M
A message.
This line is printed by the
.i mailq
command,
and is generally used to store status information.
It can contain any text.
.ip $
A macro definition.
The values of certain macros
(as of this writing, only
.b $r
and
.b $s )
are passed through to the queue run phase.
.pp
As an example,
the following is a queue file sent to
.q eric@mammoth.Berkeley.EDU
and
.q bostic@okeeffe.CS.Berkeley.EDU \**:
.(f
