@(#)README	2.5 (Berkeley) %G%

This document describes the sendmail configuration files being used
at Berkeley.  There have been several previous versions.  This file
is being written on 24 July 1991, and will probably not be generally
available for several months.

INSTALLING A NEW SITE CONFIGURATION

Configuration files are contained in the subdirectory "cf", with a
suffix ".mc".  They must be run through "m4" to produce a ".cf" file.

Every .mc file SHOULD begin with:

	divert(-1)
	COPYRIGHT NOTICE
	divert(0)

If you don't care about copyrights, you can omit this.  If you try
to patent this, I'll be very, very pissed.  I haven't patented a lot
of hot ideas so that you can use them; I expect reciprocal courtesy.
A copyleft is a copyright by another name.

The copyright, if any, MUST be followed by:

	include(../m4/cf.m4)

This will pull in the M4 macros you will need to make sense of
everything else.  As the saying goes, don't think about it, just
do it.  If you don't do it, don't bother reading the rest of this
file.

At this point, let me make one thing perfectly clear.  I am a rope
salesman.  I sell you rope.  I haven't produced a new M4 system
that detects latent bugs, nor have I tried to fix the old one.
(However, I have decided to rely on a post-V7 version; if you
are running the 4.2bsd, SysV.2, or 7th Edition version, I suggest
finding a friend with a newer version.  You can m4-expand on
their system, then run locally.)

Let's examine a typical .mc file (cf/cs-exposed.mc):

	divert(-1)

notice.  If you actually start from scratch you can delete it -- but be
honest!

	include(`../m4/cf.m4')

You need this line!

	VERSIONID(`<SCCS or RCS version id>')

VERSIONID is a macro that stuffs the version information into the
resulting file.  We use SCCS; you could use RCS, something else, or
omit it completely.

	DOMAIN(cs.exposed)

This example exposes the host inside of the CS subdomain -- that is,
it doesn't try to hide the name of the workstation to the outside
world.  Changing this to DOMAIN(cs.hidden) would have made outgoing
messages refer to "<username>@CS.Berkeley.EDU" instead of using the
local hostname.  This can also be effected by using:

	define(`MASQUERADE_AS', `masquerade.host.name.domain.name')dnl

in the ".mc" file.

	MAILER(smtp)

These describe the mailers used at the default CS site site.  The
local mailer is always included automatically.

Note that cf/cs-exposed.mc omits an OSTYPE macro -- this assumes
default Computer Science Division environment.  There are several
environments available: bsd4.3, bsd4.4, riscos4.5, sunos3.5,
sunos4.1, and ultrix4.1.  These change things like the location
of the alias file and queue directory.

MAILERS

There are fewer mailers supported in this version than the previous
version, owing mostly to a simpler world.

local		The local and prog mailers.  You will almost always
		need these; the only exception is if you relay ALL
		your mail to another site.

smtp		The Simple Mail Transport Protocol mailer.  This does
		not hide hosts behind a gateway or another other
		such hack; it assumes a world where everyone is
		running the name server.

uucp		The Unix-to-Unix Copy Program mailer.  Actually, this
		defines two mailers, "uucp" and "suucp".  The latter
		is for when you know that the UUCP mailer at the other
		end can handle multiple recipients in one transfer.

EXTENSIONS

For more complex configurations, you can define special rules.
The macro LOCAL_RULE_3 introduces rules that are used in canonicalizing
the names.  Any modifications made here are reflected in the header.

A common use is to convert old UUCP addreses to SMTP addresses using
the UUCPSMTP macro.  For example:

	LOCAL_RULE_3
	UUCPSMTP(decvax,	decvax.dec.com)
	UUCPSMTP(research,	research.att.com)

will cause addresses of the form "decvax!user" and "research!user"
to be converted to "user@decvax.dec.com" and "user@research.att.com"
respectively.

Similarly, LOCAL_RULE_0 can be used to introduce new parsing rules.
For example, new rules are needed to parse hostnames that you accept
via MX records.  For example, you might have:

	LOCAL_RULE_0
	R$+ < @ cnmat.Berkeley.EDU >	$#uucp $@ cnmat $: $1

You would use this if you had installed an MX record for cnmat.Berkeley.EDU
pointing at this host; this rule catches the message and forwards it on
using UUCP.

HIERARCHY

Within this directory are several subdirectories, to wit:

m4		General support routines.  These are typically
		very important and should not be changed without
		contacting your lawyer.

cf		The configuration files themselves.  They have
		".mc" suffixes, and must be run through m4 to
		become complete.  The resulting output should
		have a ".cf" suffix.

ostype		Definitions describing a particular operating
		system type.  These should always be referenced
		using the OSTYPE macro in the .mc file.  Examples
		include "bsd4.3", "bsd4.4", "sunos3.5", and
		"sunos4.1".

domain		Definitions describing a particular domain, referenced
		using the DOMAIN macro in the .mc file.  These are
		site dependent; for example, we contribute "cs.exposed.m4"
		and "cs.hidden.m4" which both describe hosts in the
		CS.Berkeley.EDU subdomain; the former displays the local
		hostname (e.g., mammoth.CS.Berkeley.EDU), whereas the
		latter does its best to hide the identity of the local
		workstation inside the CS subdomain.

mailer		Descriptions of mailers.   These are referenced using
		the MAILER macro in the .mc file.

sh		Shell files used when building the .cf file from the
		.mc file in the cf subdirectory.

feature		These hold special orthogonal features that you might
		want to include.  They should be referenced using
		the FEATURE macro.

hack		Local hacks.  These can be referenced using the HACK
		macro.  They shouldn't be of more than voyeuristic
		interest outside the .Berkeley.EDU domain, but who knows?
		We've all got our own peccadilloes.

siteconfig	Site configuration -- e.g., tables of locally connected
		UUCP sites.
