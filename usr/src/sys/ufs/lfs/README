The disk is laid out in segments.  Each segment is composed of one or more
groups of:
	0 or more data blocks
	0 or more inode blocks
	A segment summary

The data blocks and the inode blocks grow toward the middle of the segment.

The file system is described by a super-block which is replicated and occurs
as the first block of the first segment as well as the first block of several 
other segments.  (The maximum number of super-blocks is MAXNUMSB).  Each
super-block maintains a list of the disk addresses of all the super-blocks.
The super-block maintains a small amount of checkpoint information; enough to
find the inode for the file which contains the segment usage table and the
list of IFILE entries.

Inodes are packed page_size/sizeof(inode) to a block and move around the file
system at will.  They are accessed through the ifile (inode number IFILE_NUM)
which contains 2 data structures:

1. Segment Usage Table (struct SEGUSE) -- this keeps track of how much space
   is available and the last modified time of each segment.  Its size is
   determined at file system creation time.

2. Ifile Table (struct IFILE) -- an array of IFILE structures which describe
   the status of each inode in the file system (what its current version is,
   whether it is currently allocated or not, its last access time, and the
   disk address of the inode for that inumber). Grows in units of 1 page.  If
   the disk address is 0, then the inode is not currently allocated and the
   nextfree field maintains a free list of IFILE entries.

The structure of the ifile is as follows:
_________________________________________________________
|          |                                             |
| Segment  |  array of (IFILE structures)                |
| Usage    |                                             |
| Table    |                                             |
| (fixed   |                                             |
|    size) |                                             |

Some differences from the Sprite LFS implementation.

1. The LFS implementation placed the ifile metadata and the super block
   at fixed locations.  This implementation replicates the super block
   and puts each at a fixed location.  The checkpoint data is divided into
   two parts -- just enough information to find the IFILE is stored in
   two of the super blocks and is toggled as in the Sprite implementation.
   The remaining checkpoint information is treated as a regular file, which
   means that the segment usage table and the ifile meta-data are stored in
   normal log segments.

2. Sprite LFS distinguishes between different types of blocks in the segment.
   In general, we don't.

3. Sprite LFS traverses the IFILE looking for free blocks.  We maintain a free
   list threaded through the IFILE entries.
