.Sh NAME
.Nm soelim
.Nd eliminate \&.so's from nroff input
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm soelim
.Op Ar file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Soelim
reads the specified files or the standard input and performs the textual
inclusion implied by the
.Xr nroff 1
directives of the form:
.Pp
.Dl \&.so somefile
.Pp
The directives need to appear at the beginning of input lines.
This is useful since programs such as
.Xr tbl 1
do not normally do this; it allows the placement of individual tables
in separate files to be run as a part of a large document.
.Pp
An argument consisting of a single minus
.Ql Fl
is taken to be
a file name corresponding to the standard input.
.Pp
Note that inclusion can be suppressed by using
.Ql \e'
instead of
.Ql \e. ,
i.e.
.Pp
.Dl \'so /usr/lib/tmac.s
.Pp
A sample usage of
.Nm soelim
would be
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
soelim exum?.n \&| tbl \&| nroff \-ms \&| col \&| lpr
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr colcrt 1 ,
.Xr more 1
.Sh BUGS

exactly one blank must precede and no blanks follow the file name.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 3.0 .
