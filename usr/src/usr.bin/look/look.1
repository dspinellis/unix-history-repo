The

which contain
.Ar string
as a prefix.
As
.Nm look
performs a binary search, the lines in
.Ar file
must be sorted.

If
.Ar file
is not specified, the file
.Pa /usr/share/dict/words
is used, only alphanumeric characters are compared and the case of
alphabetic characters is ignored.

in comparisons when the

This was incorrect and the current man page matches the historic
implementation.
.Sh HISTORY

appeared in Version 7 AT&T Unix.
