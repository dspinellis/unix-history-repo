.SH NAME
last \- indicate last logins of users and ttys
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBlast\fP [-#] [-f file] [-h host] [-t tty] [user ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fILast\fP will list the sessions of specified \fIusers,\fP \fIttys,\fP
and \fIhosts,\fP in reverse time order.  Each line of output contains
the user name, the tty from which the session was conducted, any
hostname, the start and stop times for the session, and the duration
of the session.  If the session is still continuing or was cut short by
a crash or shutdown, \fIlast\fP will so indicate.
.PP
\fILast\fP reads the file \fIfile\fP, or by default, \fI/usr/adm/wtmp\fP.
The \fB-#\fP option limits the report to \fB#\fP lines.
.PP
Other arguments specify \fIusers,\fP \fIttys\fP or \fIhosts\fP of interest.
Tty names may be given fully or abbreviated, e.g., ``last -t 03'' is
equivalent to ``last -t tty03''.  Host names may be internet numbers.  If
multiple arguments are given, the information which applies to any of the
arguments is printed, e.g., ``last root -t console'' would list all of
``root's'' sessions as well as all sessions on the console terminal. If no
users, hostnames or terminals are specified, \fIlast\fP prints a record of
all logins and logouts.
.PP
The pseudo-user \fBreboot\fP logs in at reboots of the system, thus
``last reboot'' will give an indication of mean time between reboot.
.PP
If \fIlast\fP is interrupted, it indicates to what date the search has
progressed.  If interrupted with a quit signal \fIlast\fP indicates how
far the search has progressed and then continues.
