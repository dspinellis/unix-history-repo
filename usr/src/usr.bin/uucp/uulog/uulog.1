.SH NOTES
Very early releases of \s-1UUCP\s0 used separate log files
for each of the \s-1UUCP\s0 utilities;
.I uulog
was used to merge the individual logs into a master file.
This capability has not been necessary for some time and is
no longer supported.
.SH BUGS
\s-1UUCP\s0's recording of which user issued a request is unreliable.
.PP
.I Uulog
is little more than an overspecialized version of
.IR grep (1).
