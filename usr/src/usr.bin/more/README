This is the distribution of "less", a paginator similar to "more" or "pg".
The manual page is in less.man (nroff source in less.nro).

INSTALLATION:

1. Move the distributed source to its own directory and 
   unpack it by running "sh" on the distribution files,
   if you have not already done so.

2. Type "sh linstall" and answer the questions it asks.
   This will generate a makefile and a defines.h.

   If you choose not to include some features in your version,
   you may wish to edit the manual page "less.nro" and the help
   page "less.help" to remove the references to the appropriate 
   commands or options.

3. It is a good idea to look over the generated makefile 
   and make sure it looks ok.

4. Type "make" and watch the fun.

5. If the make succeeds, it will generate a program "less"
   in your current directory.  Test the generated program.

6. When satisfied that it works, if you wish to install it
   in a public place, type "make install".

If you have any problems building or running "less", 
suggestions, complaints, etc., you may mail to the 
author via USENET at:
	sun	     \
	decwrl	      }	!pyramid!ctnews!mitisft!markn
	ihnp4!hplabs /
	

Note to hackers: comments noting possible improvements are enclosed
in double curly brackets {{ like this }}.
