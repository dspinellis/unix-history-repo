.Op Fl #
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm More
is a filter for paging through text one screenful at a time.  It
uses
.Xr termcap  3
so it can run on a variety of terminals.  There is even limited support
for hardcopy terminals.  (On a hardcopy terminal, lines which should be
printed at the top of the screen are prefixed with an up-arrow.)
.Ar File
may be a single dash (``-''), implying stdin.
.Sh OPTIONS
Command line options are described below.
Options are also taken from the environment variable
.Ev MORE
(make sure to precede them with a dash (``-'')) but command
line options will override them.
.Tw Fl
.Tp Fl c
Normally,
.Nm more
will repaint the screen by scrolling from the bottom of the screen.
If the
.Fl c
option is set, when
.Nm more
needs to change the entire display, it will paint from the top line down.
.Tp Fl e
Normally, if displaying a single file,
.Nm more
exits as soon as it reaches end-of-file.  The
.Fl e
option tells more to
exit if it reaches end-of-file twice without an intervening operation.
If the file is shorter than a single screen
.Nm more
will exit at end-of-file regardless.
.Tp Fl i
The
.Fl i
option causes searches to ignore case; that is,
uppercase and lowercase are considered identical.
.Tp Fl n
The
.Fl n
flag suppresses line numbers.
The default (to use line numbers) may cause
.Nm more
to run more slowly in some cases, especially with a very large input file.
Suppressing line numbers with the
.Fl n
flag will avoid this problem.
Using line numbers means: the line number will be displayed in the
.Cm =
command, and the
.Cm v
command will pass the current line number to the editor.
.Tp Fl s
The
.Fl s
option causes
consecutive blank lines to be squeezed into a single blank line.
.Tp Fl t
The
.Fl t
option, followed immediately by a tag, will edit the file
containing that tag.  For more information, see the
.Xr ctags  1
command.
.Tp Fl u
By default,
.Nm more
treats backspaces and CR-LF sequences specially.  Backspaces which appear
adjacent to an underscore character are displayed as underlined text.
Backspaces which appear between two identical characters are displayed
as emboldened text.  CR-LF sequences are compressed to a single linefeed
character.  The
.Fl u
option causes backspaces to always be displayed as
control characters, i.e. as the two character sequence ``^H'', and CR-LF
to be left alone.
.Tp Fl x
The
.Fl x
option sets tab stops every
.Ar N
positions. The default for
.Ar N
is 8.
.Tp Fl \&/
The
.Fl \&/
option specifies a string that will be searched for before
each file is displayed.
.Sh COMMANDS
Interactive commands for
.Nm more
are based on
.Xr vi  1  .
Some commands may be preceeded by a decimal number, called N in the
descriptions below.
In the following descriptions, ^X means control-X.
.Pp
.Tw Ic
.Tp Ic h
help: display a summary of these commands.
If you forget all the other commands, remember this one.
.Tp Cx Ic SPACE
.Ws
.Cx or
.Ws
.Ic f
.Ws
.Cx or
.Ws
.Ic \&^F
.Cx
Scroll forward N lines, default one window.
If N is more than the screen size, only the final screenful is displayed.
.Tp Cx Ic b
.Ws
.Cx or
.Ws
.Ic \&^B
.Cx
Scroll backward N lines, default one window (see option -z below).
If N is more than the screen size, only the final screenful is displayed.
.Tp Cx Ic j
.Ws
.Cx or
.Ws
.Ic RETURN
.Cx
Scroll forward N lines, default 1.
The entire N lines are displayed, even if N is more than the screen size.
.Tp Ic k
Scroll backward N lines, default 1.
The entire N lines are displayed, even if N is more than the screen size.
.Tp Cx Ic d
.Ws
.Cx or
.Ws
.Ic \&^D
.Cx
Scroll forward N lines, default one half of the screen size.
If N is specified, it becomes the new default for
subsequent d and u commands.
.Tp Cx Ic u
.Ws
.Cx or
.Ws
.Ic \&^U
.Cx
Scroll backward N lines, default one half of the screen size.
If N is specified, it becomes the new default for
subsequent d and u commands.
.Tp Ic g
Go to line N in the file, default 1 (beginning of file).
.Tp Ic G
Go to line N in the file, default the end of the file.
.Tp Cx Ic p
.Ws
.Cx or
.Ws
.Ic \&%
.Cx
Go to a position N percent into the file.  N should be between 0
and 100.  (This works if standard input is being read, but only if
.Nm more
has already read to the end of the file.  It is always fast, but
not always useful.)
.Tp Cx Ic r
.Ws
.Cx or
.Ws
.Ic \&^L
.Cx
Repaint the screen.
.Tp Ic R
Repaint the screen, discarding any buffered input.
Useful if the file is changing while it is being viewed.
.Tp Ic m
Followed by any lowercase letter,
marks the current position with that letter.
.Tp Ic \&\'
(Single quote.)
Followed by any lowercase letter, returns to the position which
was previously marked with that letter.
Followed by another single quote, returns to the postion at
which the last "large" movement command was executed, or the
beginning of the file if no such movements have occurred.
All marks are lost when a new file is examined.
.Tp Cx Ic \&/
.Ar pattern
.Cx
Search forward in the file for the N-th line containing the pattern.
N defaults to 1.
The pattern is a regular expression, as recognized by
.Xr ed .
The search starts at the second line displayed.
.Tp Cx Ic \&\?
.Ar pattern
.Cx
Search backward in the file for the N-th line containing the pattern.
The search starts at the line immediately before the top line displayed.
.Tp Cx Ic \&/\&!
.Ar pattern
.Cx
Like /, but the search is for the N-th line
which does NOT contain the pattern.
.Tp Cx Ic \&?\&!
.Ar pattern
.Cx
Like ?, but the search is for the N-th line
which does NOT contain the pattern.
.Tp Ic n
Repeat previous search, for N-th line containing the last pattern
(or NOT containing the last pattern, if the previous search
was /! or ?!).
.Tp Cx Ic E
.Ws
.Op Ar filename
.Cx
Examine a new file.
If the filename is missing, the "current" file (see the N and P commands
below) from the list of files in the command line is re-examined.
If the filename is a pound sign (#), the previously examined file is
re-examined.
.Tp Cx Ic N
.Ws
.Cx or
.Ws
.Ic \&:n
.Cx
Examine the next file (from the list of files given in the command line).
If a number N is specified (not to be confused with the command N),
the N-th next file is examined.
.Tp Cx Ic P
.Ws
.Cx or
.Ws
.Ic \&:p
.Cx
Examine the previous file.
If a number N is specified, the N-th previous file is examined.
.Tp Ic \&:t
Go to supplied tag.
.Tp Ic v
Invokes an editor to edit the current file being viewed.
The editor is taken from the environment variable
.Ev EDITOR ,
or defaults to
.Xr vi  1  .
.Tp Cx Ic \&=
.Ws
.Cx or
.Ws
.Ic \&^G
.Cx
These options print out the number of the file currently being displayed
relative to the total number of files there are to display, the current
line number, the current byte number and the total bytes to display, and
what percentage of the file has been displayed.  If
.Nm more
is reading from stdin, or the file is shorter than a single screen, some
of these items may not be available.  Note, all of these items reference
the first byte of the last line displayed on the screen.
.Tp Cx Ic q
.Ws
.Cx or
.Ws
.Ic \&:q
.Ws

.Ic ZZ
