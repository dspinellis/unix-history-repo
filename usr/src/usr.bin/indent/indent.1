.TH INDENT 1 "22 December 1977"
.UC 5
.SH NAME
indent \- indent and format C program source
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B indent
.I input
[
.I output
] [
.I flags
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Indent
is intended primarily as a C program formatter.
Specifically,
.I indent
will:
.IP \(bu
indent code lines
.IP \(bu
align comments
.IP \(bu
insert spaces around operators where necessary
.IP \(bu
break up declaration lists as in ``int a,b,c;''.
.PP
.I Indent
will not break up long statements to make them fit within the
maximum line length, but it will flag lines that are too long.  Lines
will be broken so that each statement starts a new line, and braces
will appear alone on a line.  (See the \-br option to inhibit this.)
Also, an attempt is made to line up identifiers in declarations.
.PP
The 
.I flags
which can be specified follow. They
may appear before or after the file names.
If the
.I output
file is omitted, the formatted file will be written
back into
.I input
and a ``backup'' copy of
.I input
will be written in the current directory.
If
.I input
is named ``/blah/blah/file'',
the backup file will be
named ``.Bfile''.
If
.I output
is specified,
.I indent
checks to make sure it is different from
.IR input .
.PP
The following flags may be used to control the formatting
style imposed by
.IR indent .
.TP 10
.BI \-l nnn
Maximum length of an output line.  The default is 75.
.TP 10
.BI \-c nnn
The column in which comments will start.  The default is 33.
.TP 10
.BI \-cd nnn
The column in which comments on declarations will start.  The default
is for these comments to start in the same column as other comments.
.TP 10
.BI \-i nnn
The number of spaces for one indentation level.  The default is 4.
.TP 10
.BR \-dj , \-ndj
.B \-dj
will cause declarations to be left justified. 
.B \-ndj
will cause
them to be indented the same as code.  The default is
.BR \-ndj .
.TP 10
.BR \-v , \-nv
.B \-v turns on ``verbose'' mode,
.B \-nv
turns it off.  When in verbose mode,
.I indent
will report when it 
splits one line of input into two or more lines of output,
and it will give some size statistics at completion. 
The default is
.BR \-nv .
.TP 10
.BR \-bc , \-nbc
If
.B \-bc
is specified, then a newline will be forced after each
comma in a declaration. 
.B \-nbc
will turn off this option.  The default is
.BR \-bc .
.TP 10
.BI \-d nnn
This option controls the placement of comments
which are not to the right of code.
Specifying
.B \-d2
means that such comments will be placed two
indentation levels to the left of code.
The default
.B \-d0
lines up these comments with the code.
See the section on comment indentation below.
.TP 10
.BR \-br , \-bl
Specifying
.B \-bl
will cause
complex statements to be lined up like this:
.ne 4
.nf
    if (...)
    {
        code
    }
.fi
Specifying
.B \-br
(the default) will make them look like this:
.ne 3
.nf
    if (...) {
        code
    }
.fi
.PP
You may set up your own ``profile'' of defaults to
.I indent
by creating the file ``.indent.pro'' in your login directory
and including whatever switches you like.
If
.I indent
is run and a profile file exists, then it is read
to set up the program's defaults.
Switches on the command line, though,
will always override profile switches.
The profile
file must be a single line of not more than 127 characters.
The switches should be separated on the line by spaces or tabs.
.PP
.B Multi-line expressions
.PP
.I Indent
will not break up complicated expressions that extend over multiple
lines, but it will usually correctly indent such expressions which have
already been broken up.  Such an expression might end up looking like this:
.ne 10
.in +4
.nf
x =
        (
            (Arbitrary parenthesized expression)
            +
            (
                (Parenthesized expression)
                *
                (Parenthesized expression)
            )
        );

.fi
.PP
.B Comments
.PP
.I Indent
recognizes four kinds of comments. 
They are: straight text, ``box'' comments,
UNIX-style comments,
and comments that should be passed through unchanged. 
The action taken with these
various types are as follows:
.PP
.I ``Box'' comments.\ \  
.I Indent
assumes that any comment with a dash
immediately after the start of comment (i.e. ``/*\-'')
is a comment surrounded by a box of stars.  Each line
of such a comment will be left unchanged,
except that the first non-blank
character of each successive line will be lined up with the beginning
slash of the first line.  Box comments will be indented (see below).
.PP
.I ``Unix-style'' comments.\ \ 
This is the type of section header which is used 
extensively in the UNIX system source.  If the start
of comment (``/*'') appears on a
line by itself, indent assumes that it is a
UNIX-style comment.  These will be
treated similarly to box comments, except
the first non-blank character on each
line will be lined up with the `*' of the ``/*''.
.PP
.I Unchanged comments.\ \ 
Any comment which starts in column 1 will be left completely
unchanged.  This is intended primarily for documentation header pages.
The check for unchanged comments is made before
the check for UNIX-style comments.
.PP
.I Straight text.\ \ 
All other comments are treated as straight text. 
.I Indent
will fit
as many words (separated by blanks, tabs, or newlines) on a line as possible.
Straight text comments will be indented.
.PP
.B Comment indentation
.PP
Box, UNIX-style, and straight text comments may be indented.
If a comment is on a line
with code it will be started in the ``comment
column'', which is set by the
.B \-cnnn
command line parameter.
Otherwise, the
comment will be started at 
.I nnn
indentation levels less than where code is
currently being placed, where
.I nnn
is specified by the
.B \-dnnn
command line parameter.  (Indented
comments will never be placed in column 1.)
If the code on a line extends past the comment column,
the comment will be moved to the next line.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Diagnostic error messages, mostly to
tell that a text line has been broken
or is too long for the output line.
.SH FILES
