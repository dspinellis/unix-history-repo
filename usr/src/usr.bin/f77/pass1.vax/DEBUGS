WHAT THE DEBUG FLAGS MEAN:

0)	Dump core on fatal errors.  Set by default when -d is given.
	Also prints statistics on optimizations.

1)	Show data structures after optimization but before intermediate
	code generation.  Also causes each optimizer data structure to
	be printed as it is created (before optimization).

2)	Show data structures prior to optimization.

3)	Show data structures after loop optimization but before other
	optimizations.

4)	Show data structures after loop optimization and CSE but before
	other optimizations.

6)	Don't perform loop optimization.

7)	Don't do copy propagation optimization.

8)	Show data structures after fatal errors.

9)	Show data structures after loop optimization, CSE and copy
	propagation but before register optimization.

10)	Don't do register optimization.

12)	Print statistics on memory allocation (local version only).

13)	Don't do common subexpression elimination.

14)	Print history of stack temporary allocations (mkaltmpn()).
