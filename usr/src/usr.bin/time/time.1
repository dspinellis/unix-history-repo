.SH NAME
time \- time a command
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B time
[-l] command
.SH DESCRIPTION
The given command is executed; after it is complete, \fItime\fP
prints the elapsed time during the command, the time spent in the
system, and the time spent in execution of the command.  Times are
reported in seconds.  If the \fB-l\fP option is supplied, the
contents of the \fIrusage\fP structure are printed as well.
.PP
On a PDP-11, the execution time can depend on what kind of memory
the program happens to land in; the user time in MOS is often half
what it is in core.
.PP
The times are printed on the diagnostic output stream, ``stderr''.
.PP
\fITime\fP is a built-in command to \fIcsh\fP(1), with a much different
syntax.  This command is available as ``/bin/time'' to \fIcsh\fP users.
.SH BUGS
Elapsed time is accurate to the second, while the CPU times are measured
to the 100th second.  Thus the sum of the CPU times can be up to a second
larger than the elapsed time.
