.SH NAME
who \- who is on the system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B who
[ who-file ] [
.B "am I"
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIWho,\fP without any argument, reads the /var/run/utmp file,
and lists the login name, terminal name, and login time for each
user currently logged into the system.  If a single argument is
given, \fIwho\fP uses that file instead of /var/run/utmp.  Typically,
that file will be /var/log/wtmp, which contains a record of all
the logins, logouts, crashes, shutdowns and time changes since it
was created.  In either case, each login will be listed with the
user name, the terminal name (with "/dev/" suppressed), login date
and time, and, if applicable, the host logged in from.
.PP
If /var/log/wtmp is being used as the file, the user name may be empty
or one of the special characters '|', '}' and '~'.  Logouts produce
an output line without any user name.  For more information on the
special characters, see utmp(5).
.PP
With two arguments, as in `who am I' (and also `who are you'),
\fIwho\fP tells you who you are logged in as.
