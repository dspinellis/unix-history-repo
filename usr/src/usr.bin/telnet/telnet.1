.SH NAME
telnet \- User interface to the \s-1TELNET\s0 protocol
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtelnet\fR [\fB\-d\fR] [\fB\-n \fItracefile\fR] [\fIhost\fR [\fIport\fR]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B telnet
command
is used to communicate with another host using the \s-1TELNET\s+1 protocol.
If 
.B telnet
is invoked without the
.I host
argument, it enters command mode,
indicated by its prompt (\^\fBtelnet>\fR\^).
In this mode, it accepts and executes the commands listed below.
If it is invoked with arguments, it performs an
.B open
command (see below) with those arguments.
.PP
Once a connection has been opened,
\fBtelnet\fR
will attempt to enable the
\s-1TELNET LINEMODE\s+1
option.
If this fails, then
\fBtelnet\fR
will revert to one of two input modes:
either \*(lqcharacter at a time\*(rq
or \*(lqold line by line\*(rq
depending on what the remote system supports.
.PP
When \s-1LINEMODE\s+1 is enabled, character processing is done on the
local system, under the control of the remote system.  When input
editing or character echoing is to be disabled, the remote system
will relay that information.  The remote system will also relay
changes to any special characters that happen on the remote
system, so that they can take effect on the local system.
.PP
In \*(lqcharacter at a time\*(rq mode, most
text typed is immediately sent to the remote host for processing.
.PP
In \*(lqold line by line\*(rq mode, all text is echoed locally,
and (normally) only completed lines are sent to the remote host.
The \*(lqlocal echo character\*(rq (initially \*(lq^E\*(rq) may be used
to turn off and on the local echo
(this would mostly be used to enter passwords
without the password being echoed).
.PP
If the \s-1LINEMODE\s+1 option is enabled, or if the
.B localchars
toggle is TRUE (the default for \*(lqold line by line\*(lq; see below),
the user's
.BR quit ,
.BR intr ,
and
.B flush
characters are trapped locally, and sent as
\s-1TELNET\s+1
protocol sequences to the remote side.
If \s-1LINEMODE\s+1 has ever been enabled, then the user's
.B susp
and
.B eof
are also sent as
\s-1TELNET\s+1
protocol sequences,
and
.B quit
is sent as a \s-1TELNET ABORT\s+1 instead of \s-1BREAK\s+1.
There are options (see
.B toggle
.B autoflush
and
.B toggle
.B autosynch
below)
which cause this action to flush subsequent output to the terminal
(until the remote host acknowledges the
\s-1TELNET\s+1
sequence) and flush previous terminal input
(in the case of
.B quit
and
.BR intr ).
.PP
While connected to a remote host,
\fBtelnet\fR
command mode may be entered by typing the
\fBtelnet\fR
\*(lqescape character\*(rq (initially \*(lq^]\*(rq).
When in command mode, the normal terminal editing conventions are available.
.PP
Options:
.TP 8
\fB\-d\fR
Sets the initial value of the \fBdebug\fR toggle to \s-1TRUE\s+1.
.TP
\fB\-n\fI tracefile\fR
Opens \fItracefile\fR for recording trace information.
See the \fBset tracefile\fR command below.
.TP
\fIhost\fR
Indicates the official name, an alias, or the Internet address
of a remote host.
.TP
\fIport\fR
Indicates a port number (address of an application).  If a number is
not specified, the default \fBtelnet\fR port is used.
.PP
The following \fBtelnet\fR commands are available.
Only enough of each command to uniquely identify it need be typed
(this is also true for arguments to the
.BR mode ,
.BR set ,
.BR toggle ,
.BR unset ,
.BR slc ,
and
.B display
commands).
.PP
.TP 10
.B close
.br
Close a
\s-1TELNET\s+1
session and return to command mode.
.TP
.B display \fR[\fP \fIargument...\fP \fR]\fP
.br
Displays all, or some, of the
.B set
and
.B toggle
values (see below).
.TP
.B mode \fItype\fP
.br
.I Type
is one of several options, depending on the state of the
\s-1TELNET\s+1
session.
The remote host is asked for permission to go into the requested mode.
If the remote host is capable of entering that mode, the requested
mode will be entered.
.RS 10
.TP
.B character
.br
Disable the
\s-1TELNET LINEMODE\s+1
option, or, if the remote side does not understand the
\s-1LINEMODE\s+1
option, then enter \*(lqcharacter at a time\*(lq mode.
.TP
.B line
.br
Enable the
\s-1TELNET LINEMODE\s+1
option, or, if the remote side does not understand the
\s-1LINEMODE\s+1
option, then attempt to enter \*(lqold-line-by-line\*(lq mode.
.TP
.B isig (-isig)
.br
Attempt to enable (disable) the \s-1TRAPSIG\s+1 mode of the \s-1LINEMODE\s+1 option.
This requires that the \s-1LINEMODE\s+1 option be enabled.
.TP
.B edit (-edit)
.br
Attempt to enable (disable) the \s-1EDIT\s+1 mode of the \s-1LINEMODE\s+1 option.
This requires that the \s-1LINEMODE\s+1 option be enabled.
.TP
.B ?
.br
Prints out help information for the
.B mode
command.
.RE
.TP
.B open \fIhost\fP \fR[\fP [\fI-\fP]\fIport\fP \fR]\fP
.br
Open a connection to the named host.
If no port number
is specified, 
\fBtelnet\fR
will attempt to contact a
\s-1TELNET\s+1
server at the default port.
The host specification may be either a host name (see 
.BR hosts (5))
or an Internet address specified in the \*(lqdot notation\*(rq (see
.BR inet (3N)).
When connecting to a non-standard port,
\fBtelnet\fR
omits any automatic initiation of
\s-1TELNET\s+1
options.  When the port number is preceeded by a minus sign,
the inital option negotiation is done.
After establishing a connection, the \fB.telnetrc\fP in the
users home directory is opened.  Lines begining with a # are
comment lines.  Blank lines are ignored.  Lines that begin
without whitespace are the start of a machine entry.  The
first thing on the line is the name of the machine that is
being connected to.  The rest of the line, and successive
lines that begin with whitespace are assumed to be
.B telnet
commands and are processed as if they had been typed
in manually to the
.B telnet
command prompt.
.TP
.B quit
.br
Close any open
\s-1TELNET\s+1
session and exit 
.BR telnet .
An end of file (in command mode) will also close a session and exit.
.TP
.B send \fIarguments\fP
.br
Sends one or more special character sequences to the remote host.
The following are the arguments which may be specified
(more than one argument may be specified at a time):
.RS
.TP

.br
Sends the
\s-1TELNET ABORT\s+1
(ABORT processes)
sequence.
.TP
.B ao
.br
Sends the
\s-1TELNET AO\s+1
(Abort Output) sequence, which should cause the remote system to flush
all output
.B from
the remote system
.B to
the user's terminal.
.TP
.B ayt
.br
Sends the
\s-1TELNET AYT\s+1
(Are You There)
sequence, to which the remote system may or may not choose to respond.
.TP

.br
Sends the
\s-1TELNET EL\s+1
(Erase Line)
sequence, which should cause the remote system to erase the line currently
being entered.
.TP

.br
Sends the
\s-1TELNET EOF\s+1
(End Of File)
sequence.
.TP
.B eor

\s-1TELNET EOR\s+1
(End of Record)
sequence.
.TP
.B escape
.br
Sends the current
.B telnet
escape character (initially \*(lq^]\*(rq).
.TP
.B ga
.br
Sends the
\s-1TELNET GA\s+1
(Go Ahead)
sequence, which likely has no significance to the remote system.
.TP
.B getstatus
.br
If the remote side supports the
\s-1TELNET STATUS\s+1
command,
.B getstatus
will send the subnegotiation to request that the server send
its current option status.
.TP
.B ip
.br
Sends the
\s-1TELNET IP\s+1
(Interrupt Process) sequence, which should cause the remote
system to abort the currently running process.
.TP
.B nop
.br
Sends the
\s-1TELNET NOP\s+1
(No OPeration)
sequence.
.TP
.B susp
.br
Sends the
\s-1TELNET SUSP\s+1
(SUSPend process)
sequence.
.TP
.B synch
.br
Sends the
\s-1TELNET SYNCH\s+1
sequence.
This sequence causes the remote system to discard all previously typed
(but not yet read) input.
This sequence is sent as TCP urgent
data (and may not work if the remote system is a 4.2 BSD system -- if
it doesn't work, a lower case \*(lqr\*(rq may be echoed on the terminal).
.TP
.B ?
.br
Prints out help information for the
.B send
command.
.RE
.TP
.B set \fIargument value\fP
.TP
.B unset \fIarguments...\fP
.br
The
.B set
command will set any one of a number of
.B telnet
variables to a specific value or to TRUE.
The special value \fBoff\fP turns off the function associated with
the variable, this is equivalent to using the
.B unset
command.
The
.B unset
command will disable or set to FALSE any of the specified functions.
The values of variables may be interrogated with the
.B display
command.
The variables which may be set or unset, but not toggled, are
listed here.  In addition, any of the variables for the
\fBtoggle\fP command may be explicitly set or unset using
the \fBset\fP and \fBunset\fP commands.
.RS
.TP
.B echo
.br
This is the value (initially \*(lq^E\*(rq) which, when in
\*(lqline by line\*(rq mode, toggles between doing local echoing
of entered characters (for normal processing), and suppressing
echoing of entered characters (for entering, say, a password).
.TP
.B eof
.br
If
.B telnet
is operating in
\s-1LINEMODE\s+1
or \*(lqold line by line\*(rq mode, entering this character
as the first character on a line will cause this character to be
sent to the remote system.

Switch to the local defaults for the special characters.  The
local default characters are those of the local terminal at
the time when
.B telnet
was started.
.br
.TP
.B import
.br
Switch to the remote defaults for the special characters.
The remote default characters are those of the remote system
at the time when the \s-1TELNET\s+1 connection was established.
.br
.TP
.B check
.br
Verify the current settings for the current special characters.
The remote side is requested to send all the current special
character settings, and if there are any discrepencies with
the local side, the local side will switch to the remote value.
.TP
.B ?
.br
Prints out help information for the
.B slc
command.
.RE
.TP
.B ?
.br
Displays the legal
\fBset\fR (\fBunset\fR)
commands.
.RE
.TP
.B toggle \fIarguments...\fP
.br
Toggle (between
TRUE
and
FALSE)
various flags that control how
.B telnet
responds to events.
These flags may be set explicitly to TRUE or FALSE
using the
.B set
and
.B unset
commands listed above.
More than one argument may be specified.
The state of these flags may be interrogated with the
.B display
command.
Valid arguments are:
.RS
.TP
.B autoflush
.br
If
.B autoflush
and
.B localchars
are both
TRUE,
then when the
.BR ao ,
.BR intr ,
or
.B quit
characters are recognized (and transformed into
\s-1TELNET\s+1
sequences; see
.B set
above for details),
.B telnet
refuses to display any data on the user's terminal
until the remote system acknowledges (via a
\s-1TELNET TIMING MARK\s+1
option)
that it has processed those
\s-1TELNET\s+1
sequences.
The initial value for this toggle is TRUE if the terminal user had not
done an "stty noflsh", otherwise FALSE (see
.BR stty (1)).
.TP
.B autosynch
If
.B autosynch
and
.B localchars
are both
TRUE,
then when either the
.B intr
or
.B quit
characters is typed (see
.B set
above for descriptions of the
.B intr
and
.B quit
characters), the resulting
\s-1TELNET\s+1
sequence sent is followed by the
\s-1TELNET SYNCH\s+1
sequence.
This procedure
.B should
cause the remote system to begin throwing away all previously
typed input until both of the
\s-1TELNET\s+1
sequences have been read and acted upon.
The initial value of this toggle is FALSE.
.TP
.B binary
.br
Enable or disable the
\s-1TELNET BINARY\s+1
option on both input and output.
.TP
.B inbinary
.br
Enable or disable the
\s-1TELNET BINARY\s+1
option on input.
.TP
.B outbinary
.br
Enable or disable the
\s-1TELNET BINARY\s+1
option on output.
.TP
.B crlf
.br
If this is TRUE, then carriage returns will be sent as <CR><LF>.
If this is FALSE, then carriage returns will be send as <CR><NUL>.
The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.
.TP
.B crmod
.br
Toggle carriage return mode.
When this mode is enabled, most carriage return characters received from
the remote host will be mapped into a carriage return followed by
a line feed.
This mode does not affect those characters typed by the user, only
those received from the remote host.
This mode is not very useful unless the remote host
only sends carriage return, but never line feed.
The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.
.TP
.B debug
.br
Toggles socket level debugging (useful only to the
.IR super user ).
The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.
.TP
.B localchars
.br
If this is
TRUE,
then the
.BR flush ,
.BR interrupt ,
.BR quit ,
.BR erase ,
and
.B kill
characters (see
.B set
above) are recognized locally, and transformed into (hopefully) appropriate
\s-1TELNET\s+1
control sequences
(respectively
.BR ao ,
.BR ip ,
.BR brk ,
.BR ec ,
and
.BR el ;
see
.B send
above).
The initial value for this toggle is TRUE in \*(lqold line by line\*(rq mode,
and FALSE in \*(lqcharacter at a time\*(rq mode.
When the
\s-1LINEMODE\s+1
option is enabled, the value of
.B localchars
is ignored, and assumed to always be TRUE.
If
\s-1LINEMODE\s+1
has ever been enabled, then
.B quit
is sent as
.BR abort ,
and
.BR eof and
.B suspend
are sent as
.BR eof and
.BR susp ,
see
.B send
above).
.TP
.B netdata
.br
Toggles the display of all network data (in hexadecimal format).
The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.
.TP
.B options
.br
Toggles the display of some internal
.B telnet
protocol processing (having to do with
\s-1TELNET\s+1
options).
The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.
.TP
.B prettydump
.br
When the
.B netdata
toggle is enabled, if
.B prettydump
is enabled the output from the
.B netdata
command will be formated in a more user readable format.
Spaces are put between each character in the output, and the
begining of any
\s-1TELNET\s+1
escape sequence is preceeded by a '*' to aid in locating them.
.TP
.B ?
