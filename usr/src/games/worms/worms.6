.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad b
Brian Horn (cithep!bdh) showed me a
.I TOPS-20
program on the DEC-2136 machine called
.IR WORM ,
and suggested that I write a similar program that would run under
.IR Unix .
I did, and no apologies.

.B -field
makes a "field" for the worm(s) to eat;
.B -trail
causes each worm to leave a trail behind it.  You can figure
out the rest by yourself.
