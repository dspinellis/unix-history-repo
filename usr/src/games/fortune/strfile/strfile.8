.SH NAME
strfile, unstr \- create a random access file for storing strings
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B strfile
[
.B \-iors
] [
.B \-c char
]
sourcefile
[ datafile ]
.sp
.B unstr
[
.B \-o
] [

datafile[.dat] [ outfile ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Strfile
takes a file which contains a set of strings and creates a data file
which contains those strings, along with a seek pointer table to the
beginning of each.
This allows random access of the strings.
.PP
The source file contains strings separated by lines containing
a single percent (``%'') sign.
.PP
The data file, if not specified on the command line, is named
.IB sourcefile .out ,
and contains a header, which describes the contents of the data file,
the seek pointers to the beginning of each string, and the strings
themselves, terminated by null bytes.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP
.BI \-c \ char
Change the delimiting character from the percent sign to
.IR char .
.TP
.B \-i
Ignore case when ordering the strings.
.TP
.B \-o
Order the strings in alphabetical order.
The strings will be stored in the same order in the data file
as they were in the source, but the seek pointer table will be
sorted in alphabetical order of the strings pointed to.
Any
.I initial
non-alphanumeric characters are ignored.
This option sets the STR_ORDERED bit in the
.B str_flags
field of the header.
.TP
.B \-r
Randomize the order of the seek pointers in the table.
The strings will be stored in the same order in the data file
as they were in the source, but the seek pointer table will
be randomized.
This option sets the STR_RANDOM bit in the
.B str_flags
field of the header.
.TP
.B \-s
Run silently; don't give a summary of data at the end.
.PP
The format of the header is:
.sp
.nf
#define	STR_RANDOM	0x1
#define	STR_ORDERED	0x2

unsigned long	str_numstr;	/* # of strings in the file */
unsigned long	str_longlen;	/* length of longest string */
unsigned long	str_shortlen;	/* length of shortest string */
unsigned char	str_flags;	/* bit field for flags */
char str_delim;			/* delimiting character */
.fi
.PP
The field
.B str_flags
will have the bit STR_RANDOM set if the
.B \-r
flag was specified, or STR_ORDERED if the
.B \-o
flag was specified.
.PP
The purpose of
.I unstr
is to undo the work of
.IR strfile .
It primarily exists as an emergency backup in case the source file
is accidentally deleted and the data file is still available.
It reads data files and creates a corresponding output file.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP
.B \-c \ char
This option allows specification of a delimiting character to be
used instead of the default percent sign.
.TP
.B \-o
.I Unstr
normally prints out the strings in the order they are in the data file.
If you specify the
.B -o
option, it will print them out in the header order, which could be
different if the file was randomized or ordered when created.
It is possible to create sorted versions of input files by using
.B \-o
when
.I strfile
is run and then using
.B "unstr \-o"
to dump them out in the table order.
