.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIRmf\fR removes all of the messages (files) within the specified
(or default) folder,
and then removes the folder (directory) itself.
If there are any files within the folder which are not a part of \fIMH\fR,
they will \fInot\fR be removed, and an error will be produced.
If the folder is given explicitly or the `\-nointeractive' option is given,
then the folder will be removed without confirmation.
Otherwise, the user will be asked for confirmation.
If \fIrmf\fR can't find the current folder, for some reason,
the folder to be removed defaults to `+inbox' with confirmation.

\fIRmf\fR irreversibly deletes messages that don't have other links,
so use it with caution.

If the folder being removed is a subfolder, the parent
folder will become the new current folder, and \fIrmf\fR will
produce a message telling the user this has happened.
This provides an easy mechanism for selecting a set of messages,
operating on the list, then removing the list and returning to
the current folder from which the list was extracted.

\fIRmf\fR of a read\-only folder will delete the private sequence
and cur information
(i.e., \*(lqatr\-\fIseq\fR\-\fIfolder\fR\*(rq entries)
from the profile without affecting the folder itself.

`+folder' defaults to the current folder, usually with confirmation
.Ds
`\-interactive' if +folder' not given, `\-nointeractive' otherwise
.Co
\fIRmf\fR will set the current folder to the parent folder if a
subfolder is removed; or if the current folder is removed,
it will make \*(lqinbox\*(rq current.
Otherwise, it doesn't change the
current folder or message.
.Bu
Although intuitively one would suspect that \fIrmf\fR works recursively,
it does not.
Hence if you have a sub\-folder within a folder,
in order to \fIrmf\fR the parent,
you must first \fIrmf\fR each of the children.
