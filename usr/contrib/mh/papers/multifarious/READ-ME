[ For the following, substitute the name of the directory this file resides
  in for "foo".  E.G., if this file is mh5/READ-ME, s%foo%mh5%g ]

    The Makefile assumes you have PhDTeX on your system.  PhDTeX is
    AmSTeX with diss.sty preloaded.  If you don't have PhDTeX, then
    change the Makefile to run AmSTeX instead and the foo.tex file will
    automatically input diss.sty.  If you don't have AmSTeX, talk to
    your local TeX maintainer and find out where Michael Spivak's
    AmS-TeX macro package is kept, and run TeX like this

	tex \\input amstex \\input foo

    This is really slow, but that's life.


    If you don't have the wonderful amcscod10 fonts at your site,
    then in diss.sty, replace the two lines (at line 107):

\font\tencscod=amcscod10
\font\eightcscod=amcscod10 at 8\p@

    with

\let\tencscod=\tencsc
\let\eightcscod=\eightcsc

    If you want to get your hands on amcscod10 font, drop a note to

	Bug-TeX@UCI

    and ask for it.  They have the metafont source available.  It's a
    lot easier just to edit the two lines above though.
