	GNU Emacs availability information, 22 Nov 1985
	     Copyright (C) 1985 Richard M. Stallman

   Permission is granted to anyone to make or distribute
   verbatim copies of this document provided that the
   copyright notice and this permission notice are preserved.

GNU Emacs is legally owned by me, Richard Stallman, its author,
but I regard myself actually as its custodian on behalf of the
public, since all software ought to be the common property of
mankind.

I permit everyone to have and run copies of GNU Emacs, at no
charge, and to redistribute copies under certain conditions which
are designed to make sure that that all modified versions of GNU
Emacs remain as free as the versions I distribute.  These
conditions are stated in the document "GNU Emacs General Public
License", a copy of which is required to be distributed with
every copy of GNU Emacs.  It is usually in a file named COPYING
in the same directory as this file.

If you do not know anyone to get a copy of GNU Emacs from, you
can order a tape from the Free Software Foundation.  We distribute
Emacs in tar format on 1600bpi industry standard mag tapes.  We
also distributed nicely typeset copies of the Emacs manual.
See the order form at the end of this file.

If you have Internet access, you can copy the latest Emacs
distribution from host PREP.AI.MIT.ARPA.  There are several ways to do
this; see the file `/u2/emacs/GETTING.GNU.SOFTWARE' for info on
current arrangements.

See the file MACHINES in this directory for a list of machines
that GNU Emacs has been tested on.  Emacs has been run on both
Berkeley Unix and System V Unix, on a variety of types of cpu.

Note that there is significant variation between Unix systems
supposedly running the same version of Unix; it is possible that
what works in GNU Emacs for me does not work on your system due
to such an incompatibility.  Since I must avoid reading Unix
source code, I cannot even guess what such problems may exist.

GNU Emacs is distributed with no warranty (see the General Public
License for full details), and neither I nor the Free Software
Foundation promises any kind of support or assistance to users.
The foundation keeps a list of people who are willing to offer
support and assistance for hire.  We will list anyone who pays a
$50 listing fee.

However, I plan to continue to improve GNU Emacs and keep it
reliable, so please send me any complaints and suggestions you
have.  I will probably fix anything that is clearly (to me) a
malfunction.  I may make an improvement if I consider it worth
the effort, but you should not be surprised if I don't think I
can spare time for it.  I hope to keep Emacs stable now, and
avoid putting much time into it, so I can work on other parts of
the GNU system.

If you are on the Internet, report bugs to
bug-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu; on Usenet, use the address
...!ucbvax!bug-gnu-emacs%prep.ai.mit.edu.  Otherwise, phone the
foundation at (617) 876-3296, or write to the address listed
below.

If you are a computer manufacturer, I encourage you to ship a
copy of GNU Emacs with every computer you deliver.  The same
copying permission terms apply to computer manufacturers as to
everyone else.

If you like GNU Emacs, please express your satisfaction with a
donation: send me or the Foundation what you feel Emacs has been
worth to you.  If you are glad that I developed GNU Emacs and
distribute it as freeware, rather than following the obstructive
and antisocial practices typical of software developers, reward
me for doing so!

Your donations will help to support the development of more
useful software to be distributed on the same basis as GNU Emacs.
Eventually we will have a complete imitation of the Unix
operating system, called GNU (Gnu's Not Unix), which will run
Unix user programs.  For more information on GNU, see the file
GNU in this directory.
