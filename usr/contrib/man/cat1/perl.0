       _P_e_r_l  is  an  interpreted  language optimized for scanning
       arbitrary text files, extracting  information  from  those
       text  files,  and  printing reports based on that informa-
       tion.  It's also a good language for many  system  manage-
       ment  tasks.   The  language  is  intended to be practical
       (easy to use, efficient, complete) rather  than  beautiful
       (tiny,  elegant,  minimal).   It combines (in the author's
       opinion, anyway) some of the best features of C, _s_e_d, _a_w_k,
       and  _s_h,  so  people  familiar with those languages should
       have little difficulty with it.  (Language historians will
       also  note  some  vestiges of _c_s_h, Pascal, and even BASIC-
       PLUS.)  Expression syntax corresponds quite closely  to  C
       expression  syntax.  Unlike most Unix utilities, _p_e_r_l does
       not arbitrarily limit the size of your data--if you've got
       the  memory, _p_e_r_l can slurp in your whole file as a single
       string.  Recursion is of unlimited depth.   And  the  hash
       tables  used  by  associative  arrays grow as necessary to
       prevent degraded  performance.   _P_e_r_l  uses  sophisticated
       pattern  matching techniques to scan large amounts of data
       very quickly.  Although optimized for scanning text,  _p_e_r_l
       can  also  deal  with  binary data, and can make dbm files
       look like associative arrays  (where  dbm  is  available).
       Setuid  _p_e_r_l  scripts  are safer than C programs through a
       dataflow tracing  mechanism  which  prevents  many  stupid
       security holes.  If you have a problem that would ordinar-
       ily use _s_e_d or _a_w_k or _s_h, but it exceeds  their  capabili-
       ties  or  must  run a little faster, and you don't want to
       write the silly thing in C, then  _p_e_r_l  may  be  for  you.
       There  are  also  translators  to  turn  your  _s_e_d and _a_w_k
       scripts into _p_e_r_l scripts.  OK, enough hype.

       Upon startup, _p_e_r_l looks for your script  in  one  of  the
       following places:

       1.  Specified  line by line via --ee switches on the command
           line.

       2.  Contained in the file specified by the first  filename
           on  the  command  line.  (Note that systems supporting
           the #! notation invoke interpreters this way.)

       3.  Passed in implicitly via standard  input.   This  only
           works  if  there  are  no  filename arguments--to pass
           arguments  to  a  _s_t_d_i_n  script  you  must  explicitly

           specify a - for the script name.

       After  locating your script, _p_e_r_l compiles it to an inter-
       nal form.  If the script is syntactically correct,  it  is
       executed.

       Note:  on  first  reading  this  section may not make much
       sense to you.  It's here at the front for easy  reference.

       A single-character option may be combined with the follow-
       ing option, if any.   This  is  particularly  useful  when
       invoking a script using the #! construct which only allows
       one argument.  Example:

            #!/usr/bin/perl -spi.bak # same as -s -p -i.bak
            ...

       Options include:

       --00_d_i_g_i_t_s
            specifies the record separator ($/) as an octal  num-
            ber.   If  there are no digits, the null character is
            the separator.  Other switches may precede or  follow
            the  digits.   For  example, if you have a version of
            _f_i_n_d which can print filenames terminated by the null
            character, you can say this:

                find . -name '*.bak' -print0 | perl -n0e unlink

            The  special  value 00 will cause Perl to slurp files
            in paragraph mode.  The value 0777 will cause Perl to
            slurp  files  whole since there is no legal character
            with that value.

       --aa   turns on autosplit mode when used with a  --nn  or  --pp.
            An  implicit split command to the @F array is done as
            the first thing inside the implicit while  loop  pro-
            duced by the --nn or --pp.

                 perl -ane 'print pop(@F), "\n";'

            is equivalent to

                 while (<>) {
                      @F = split(' ');
                      print pop(@F), "\n";
                 }

       --cc   causes  _p_e_r_l  to  check  the syntax of the script and
            then exit without executing it.

       --dd   runs the script under the  perl  debugger.   See  the
            section on Debugging.

       --DD_n_u_m_b_e_r
            sets  debugging flags.  To watch how it executes your
            script, use --DD1144.  (This only works if  debugging  is
            compiled  into  your  _p_e_r_l.)   Another  nice value is
            -D1024, which lists your compiled syntax  tree.   And
            -D512 displays compiled regular expressions.

       --ee _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_l_i_n_e
            may be used to enter one line of script.  Multiple --ee
            commands may  be  given  to  build  up  a  multi-line
            script.   If  --ee  is  given, _p_e_r_l will not look for a
            script filename in the argument list.

       --ii_e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n
            specifies that files processed by  the  <>  construct
            are  to be edited in-place.  It does this by renaming
            the input file, opening the output file by  the  same
            name,  and  selecting that output file as the default
            for print statements.  The extension, if supplied, is
            added  to  the  name of the old file to make a backup
            copy.  If no extension  is  supplied,  no  backup  is
            made.   Saying "perl -p -i.bak -e "s/foo/bar/;" ... "
            is the same as using the script:

                 #!/usr/bin/perl -pi.bak
                 s/foo/bar/;

            which is equivalent to

                 #!/usr/bin/perl
                 while (<>) {
                      if ($ARGV ne $oldargv) {
                           rename($ARGV, $ARGV . '.bak');
                           open(ARGVOUT, ">$ARGV");
                           select(ARGVOUT);
                           $oldargv = $ARGV;
                      }
                      s/foo/bar/;
                 }
                 continue {
                     print;     # this prints to original filename
                 }
                 select(STDOUT);

            except that the --ii form doesn't need to compare $ARGV

            to  $oldargv  to  know when the filename has changed.
            It does, however, use ARGVOUT for the selected  file-
            handle.   Note that _S_T_D_O_U_T is restored as the default
            output filehandle after the loop.

            You can use eof to locate the end of each input file,
            in  case  you  want  to append to each file, or reset
            line numbering (see example under eof).

       --II_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
            may be used in conjunction with --PP to tell the C pre-
            processor  where  to  look  for  include  files.   By
            default /usr/include and /usr/lib/perl are  searched.

       --ll_o_c_t_n_u_m
            enables automatic line-ending processing.  It has two
            effects: first, it automatically chops the line  ter-
            minator  when  used  with  --nn  or --pp ,, and second, it
            assigns $\ to have the value of _o_c_t_n_u_m  so  that  any
            print statements will have that line terminator added
            back on.  If _o_c_t_n_u_m is omitted, sets $\ to  the  cur-
            rent  value of $/.  For instance, to trim lines to 80
            columns:

                 perl -lpe 'substr($_, 80) = ""'

            Note that the assignment $\ = $/  is  done  when  the
            switch  is  processed,  so the input record separator
            can be different than the output record separator  if
            the --ll switch is followed by a --00 switch:

                 gnufind / -print0 | perl -ln0e 'print "found $_" if -p'

            This  sets $\ to newline and then sets $/ to the null
            character.

       --nn   causes _p_e_r_l to assume the following loop around  your
            script,  which  makes  it iterate over filename argu-
            ments somewhat like "sed -n" or _a_w_k:

                 while (<>) {
                      ...       # your script goes here
                 }

            Note that the lines are not printed by default.   See
            --pp  to  have lines printed.  Here is an efficient way
            to delete all files older than a week:

                 find . -mtime +7 -print | perl -nle 'unlink;'

            This is faster than using the -exec  switch  of  find

            because  you  don't  have to start a process on every
            filename found.

       --pp   causes _p_e_r_l to assume the following loop around  your
            script,  which  makes  it iterate over filename argu-
            ments somewhat like _s_e_d:

                 while (<>) {
                      ...       # your script goes here
                 } continue {
                      print;
                 }

            Note that the lines are  printed  automatically.   To
            suppress  printing use the --nn switch.  A --pp overrides
            a --nn switch.

       --PP   causes your script to be run through the C preproces-
            sor before compilation by _p_e_r_l.  (Since both comments
            and cpp directives begin with the  #  character,  you
            should  avoid starting comments with any words recog-
            nized by the C preprocessor such as "if",  "else"  or
            "define".)

       --ss   enables  some rudimentary switch parsing for switches
            on the command line after the script name but  before
            any  filename arguments (or before a --).  Any switch
            found there is removed from @ARGV and sets the corre-
            sponding  variable in the _p_e_r_l script.  The following
            script prints "true" if and only  if  the  script  is
            invoked with a -xyz switch.

                 #!/usr/bin/perl -s
                 if ($xyz) { print "true\n"; }


       --SS   makes  _p_e_r_l  use  the  PATH  environment  variable to
            search for the script (unless the name of the  script
            starts with a slash).  Typically this is used to emu-
            late #! startup on machines that don't support #!, in
            the following manner:

                 #!/usr/bin/perl
                 eval "exec /usr/bin/perl -S $0 $*"
                      if $running_under_some_shell;

            The  system  ignores  the  first  line  and feeds the
            script to /bin/sh, which proceeds to try  to  execute
            the  _p_e_r_l  script  as a shell script.  The shell exe-
            cutes the second line as a normal shell command,  and
            thus starts up the _p_e_r_l interpreter.  On some systems

            $0 doesn't always contain the full pathname,  so  the
            --SS  tells _p_e_r_l to search for the script if necessary.
            After _p_e_r_l locates the script, it  parses  the  lines
            and   ignores   them   because   the  variable  $run-
            ning_under_some_shell is never true.  A  better  con-
            struct  than  $*  would  be  ${1+"$@"}, which handles
            embedded  spaces  and  such  in  the  filenames,  but
            doesn't  work  if  the script is being interpreted by
            csh.  In order to start up sh rather than  csh,  some
            systems  may  have to replace the #! line with a line
            containing just  a  colon,  which  will  be  politely
            ignored  by  perl.  Other systems can't control that,
            and need a totally devious construct that  will  work
            under any of csh, sh or perl, such as the following:

                 eval '(exit $?0)' && eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -S $0 ${1+"$@"}'
                 & eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -S $0 $argv:q'
                      if 0;


       --uu   causes _p_e_r_l to dump core after compiling your script.
            You can then take this core dump and turn it into  an
            executable file by using the undump program (not sup-
            plied).  This speeds startup at the expense  of  some
            disk  space  (which you can minimize by stripping the
            executable).   (Still,  a  "hello  world"  executable
            comes  out  to about 200K on my machine.)  If you are
            going to run your executable as a set-id program then
            you should probably compile it using taintperl rather
            than normal perl.  If you want to execute  a  portion
            of  your script before dumping, use the dump operator
            instead.  Note: availability of  undump  is  platform
            specific and may not be available for a specific port
            of perl.

       --UU   allows _p_e_r_l to do unsafe operations.   Currently  the
            only  "unsafe" operations are the unlinking of direc-
            tories while running as superuser, and running setuid
            programs  with  fatal  taint checks turned into warn-
            ings.

            and references to undefined filehandles  or  filehan-
            dles opened readonly that you are attempting to write

            fied, Perl will switch to that directory before  run-

            minated  with __END__ if there is trailing garbage to
            be ignored (the script can process any or all of  the
            trailing garbage via the DATA filehandle if desired).

       _P_e_r_l has three data types: scalars, arrays of scalars, and
       associative  arrays of scalars.  Normal arrays are indexed
       by number, and associative arrays by string.

       The interpretation of operations and values in perl  some-
       times  depends  on  the requirements of the context around
       the operation or value.  There are three  major  contexts:
       string,  numeric  and  array.   Certain  operations return
       array values in contexts wanting an array, and scalar val-
       ues  otherwise.   (If this is true of an operation it will
       be mentioned in the  documentation  for  that  operation.)
       Operations  which  return  scalars  don't care whether the
       context is looking for a string or a  number,  but  scalar
       variables and values are interpreted as strings or numbers
       as appropriate to the context.  A scalar is interpreted as
       TRUE  in the boolean sense if it is not the null string or
       0.  Booleans returned by operators are 1 for true and 0 or
       '' (the null string) for false.

       There  are  actually two varieties of null string: defined
       and undefined.  Undefined null strings are  returned  when
       there  is  no real value for something, such as when there
       was an error, or at end of file, or when you refer  to  an
       uninitialized  variable  or element of an array.  An unde-
       fined null string may become defined the  first  time  you
       access  it,  but  prior  to that you can use the defined()
       operator to determine whether the value is defined or not.

       References to scalar variables always begin with '$', even
       when referring to a scalar  that  is  part  of  an  array.
       Thus:

           $days[28]       # 29th element of array @days
           $days{'Feb'}    # one value from an associative array
           $#days          # last index of array @days

       but entire arrays or array slices are denoted by '@':

           @days           # ($days[0], $days[1],... $days[n])
           @days[3,4,5]    # same as @days[3..5]
           @days{'a','c'}  # same as ($days{'a'},$days{'c'})

       and entire associative arrays are denoted by '%':

           %days           # (key1, val1, key2, val2 ...)

       Any of these eight constructs may serve as an lvalue, that
       is, may be assigned  to.   (It  also  turns  out  that  an
       assignment  is  itself  an lvalue in certain contexts--see
       examples under s, tr and chop.)  Assignment  to  a  scalar
       evaluates  the  righthand  side in a scalar context, while
       assignment to an array or array slice evaluates the right-
       hand side in an array context.

       You  may  find  the  length  of  array @days by evaluating
       "$#days", as in _c_s_h.  (Actually, it's not  the  length  of
       the  array,  it's the subscript of the last element, since
       there is (ordinarily) a 0th element.)  Assigning to $#days
       changes  the  length of the array.  Shortening an array by
       this method does not actually destroy any values.  Length-
       ening  an array that was previously shortened recovers the
       values that were in those elements.   You  can  also  gain
       some  measure  of efficiency by preextending an array that
       is going to get big.  (You can also  extend  an  array  by
       assigning  to an element that is off the end of the array.
       This differs from assigning to $#whatever in  that  inter-
       vening values are set to null rather than recovered.)  You
       can truncate an array down to  nothing  by  assigning  the
       null list () to it.  The following are exactly equivalent

            @whatever = ();
            $#whatever = $[ - 1;


       If  you  evaluate an array in a scalar context, it returns
       the length of the array.  The following is always true:

            scalar(@whatever) == $#whatever - $[ + 1;

       If you evaluate an associative array in a scalar  context,
       it  returns a value which is true if and only if the array
       contains any elements.  (If there are  any  elements,  the

       value  returned  is  a  string consisting of the number of
       used buckets and the number of  allocated  buckets,  sepa-
       rated by a slash.)

       Multi-dimensional  arrays  are not directly supported, but
       see the discussion of the $; variable later for a means of
       emulating  multiple  subscripts with an associative array.
       You could also write a subroutine to  turn  multiple  sub-
       scripts into a single subscript.

       Every  data  type has its own namespace.  You can, without
       fear of conflict, use the same name for a scalar variable,
       an array, an associative array, a filehandle, a subroutine
       name, and/or a label.  Since variable and array references
       always  start  with '$', '@', or '%', the "reserved" words
       aren't in fact reserved with respect  to  variable  names.
       (They ARE reserved with respect to labels and filehandles,
       however, which don't have an  initial  special  character.
       Hint:   you  could  say  open(LOG,'logfile')  rather  than
       open(log,'logfile').   Using  uppercase  filehandles  also
       improves  readability  and protects you from conflict with
       future reserved words.)  Case IS significant--"FOO", "Foo"
       and "foo" are all different names.  Names which start with
       a letter may also contain digits and  underscores.   Names
       which  do not start with a letter are limited to one char-
       acter, e.g. "$%" or "$$".   (Most  of  the  one  character
       names  have  a  predefined  significance  to  _p_e_r_l.   More
       later.)

       Numeric literals are specified in any of the usual  float-
       ing point or integer formats:

           12345
           12345.67
           .23E-10
           0xffff     # hex
           0377  # octal
           4_294_967_296

       String  literals  are delimited by either single or double
       quotes.  They work much like shell  quotes:  double-quoted
       string literals are subject to backslash and variable sub-
       stitution; single-quoted strings are not  (except  for  \'
       and \\).  The usual backslash rules apply for making char-
       acters such as newline, tab, etc., as well  as  some  more
       exotic forms:

            \t        tab
            \n        newline
            \r        return
            \f        form feed

       You can also embed newlines directly in your strings, i.e.
       they can end on a different line than they begin.  This is
       nice,  but  if  you  forget your trailing quote, the error
       will not be reported until _p_e_r_l finds  another  line  con-
       taining  the quote character, which may be much further on
       in the script.  Variable substitution  inside  strings  is
       limited  to  scalar  variables,  normal  array values, and
       array slices.  (In other words, identifiers beginning with
       $  or @, followed by an optional bracketed expression as a
       subscript.)  The following code segment  prints  out  "The
       price is $100."

           $Price = '$100';               # not interpreted
           print "The price is $Price.\n";# interpreted

       Note that you can put curly brackets around the identifier
       to delimit it from  following  alphanumerics.   Also  note
       that  a single quoted string must be separated from a pre-
       ceding word by a space, since  single  quote  is  a  valid
       character in an identifier (see Packages).

       Two special literals are __LINE__ and __FILE__, which rep-
       resent the current line number and filename at that  point
       in  your  program.   They  may  only  be  used as separate
       tokens; they will not be interpolated  into  strings.   In
       addition,  the  token  __END__ may be used to indicate the
       logical end of the script before the actual end  of  file.
       Any  following  text  is  ignored, but may be read via the
       DATA filehandle.  (The DATA filehandle may read data  only
       from  the  main  script, but not from any required file or
       evaluated string.)  The two control characters ^D  and  ^Z
       are synonyms for __END__.

       A  word  that doesn't have any other interpretation in the
       grammar will be treated as if it had single quotes  around
       it.   For  this  purpose, a word consists only of alphanu-
       meric characters and underline, and  must  start  with  an
       alphabetic  character.   As with filehandles and labels, a
       bare word that  consists  entirely  of  lowercase  letters

       the --ww switch, Perl will warn you about any such words.

       Array values are interpolated into  double-quoted  strings
       by  joining  all the elements of the array with the delim-
       iter specified in  the  $"  variable,  space  by  default.
       (Since  in  versions  of perl prior to 3.0 the @ character
       was not a  metacharacter  in  double-quoted  strings,  the
       interpolation   of   @array,  $array[EXPR],  @array[LIST],
       $array{EXPR}, or @array{LIST} only  happens  if  array  is
       referenced  elsewhere  in  the  program or is predefined.)
       The following are equivalent:

            $temp = join($",@ARGV);
            system "echo $temp";

            system "echo @ARGV";

       Within search patterns (which also undergo  double-quotish
       substitution) there is a bad ambiguity:  Is /$foo[bar]/ to
       be interpreted as /${foo}[bar]/ (where [bar] is a  charac-
       ter  class for the regular expression) or as /${foo[bar]}/
       (where [bar] is the subscript to  array  @foo)?   If  @foo
       doesn't  otherwise  exist, then it's obviously a character
       class.  If @foo exists, perl  takes  a  good  guess  about
       [bar],  and  is  almost  always  right.   If it does guess
       wrong, or if you're just plain paranoid, you can force the
       correct interpretation with curly brackets as above.

       A  line-oriented  form  of  quoting  is based on the shell
       here-is syntax.  Following a << you specify  a  string  to
       terminate the quoted material, and all lines following the
       current line down to the terminating string are the  value
       of  the  item.   The  terminating  string may be either an
       identifier (a word), or some quoted text.  If quoted,  the
       type  of  quotes  you  use determines the treatment of the
       text, just as in regular quoting.  An unquoted  identifier
       works  like double quotes.  There must be no space between
       the << and the identifier.  (If you put a space it will be
       treated  as a null identifier, which is valid, and matches
       the first blank line--see Merry Christmas example  below.)
       The terminating string must appear by itself (unquoted and
       with no surrounding whitespace) on the terminating line.

            print <<EOF;        # same as above
       The price is $Price.
       EOF

            print <<"EOF";      # same as above
       The price is $Price.
       EOF

       Array literals are denoted by separating individual values
       by commas, and enclosing the list in parentheses:

            (LIST)

       In  a  context  not requiring an array value, the value of
       the array literal is the value of the final element, as in
       the C comma operator.  For example,

           @foo = ('cc', '-E', $bar);

       assigns the entire array value to array foo, but

           $foo = ('cc', '-E', $bar);

       assigns  the  value of variable bar to variable foo.  Note
       that the value of an actual array in a scalar  context  is
       the length of the array; the following assigns to $foo the
       value 3:

           @foo = ('cc', '-E', $bar);
           $foo = @foo;         # $foo gets 3

       You may have an optional comma before the  closing  paren-
       thesis of an array literal, so that you can say:

           @foo = (
            1,
            2,
            3,
           );

       When  a  LIST  is  evaluated,  each element of the list is
       evaluated in an array context,  and  the  resulting  array
       value is interpolated into LIST just as if each individual
       element were a member of LIST.   Thus  arrays  lose  their
       identity in a LIST--the list

            (@foo,@bar,&SomeSub)

       contains all the elements of @foo followed by all the ele-
       ments of @bar, followed by all the  elements  returned  by
       the subroutine named SomeSub.

       A  list value may also be subscripted like a normal array.
       Examples:

            $time = (stat($file))[8];     # stat returns array value
            $digit = ('a','b','c','d','e','f')[$digit-10];
            return (pop(@foo),pop(@foo))[0];


       Array lists may be assigned to if and only if each element
       of the list is an lvalue:

           ($a, $b, $c) = (1, 2, 3);

           ($map{'red'}, $map{'blue'}, $map{'green'}) = (0x00f, 0x0f0, 0xf00);

       The final element may be an array or an associative array:

           ($a, $b, @rest) = split;
           local($a, $b, %rest) = @_;

       You  can  actually  put an array anywhere in the list, but
       the first array in the list will soak up all  the  values,
       and  anything after it will get a null value.  This may be
       useful in a local().

       An associative array literal contains pairs of  values  to
       be interpreted as a key and a value:

           # same as map assignment above
           %map = ('red',0x00f,'blue',0x0f0,'green',0xf00);

       Array assignment in a scalar context returns the number of
       elements produced by the expression on the right  side  of
       the assignment:

            $x = (($foo,$bar) = (3,2,1)); # set $x to 3, not 2


       There  are  several  other pseudo-literals that you should
       know about.  If a string is enclosed by  backticks  (grave
       accents),  it  first  undergoes variable substitution just
       like a double quoted string.  It is then interpreted as  a
       command,  and  the  output of that command is the value of
       the pseudo-literal, like in a shell.  In a scalar context,
       a  single string consisting of all the output is returned.

       In an array context, an array of values is  returned,  one
       for each line of output.  (You can set $/ to use a differ-
       ent line terminator.)  The command is executed  each  time
       the  pseudo-literal is evaluated.  The status value of the
       command is returned in $? (see Predefined  Names  for  the
       interpretation  of  $?).  Unlike in _c_s_h, no translation is
       done on the return data--newlines remain newlines.  Unlike
       in  any  of the shells, single quotes do not hide variable
       names in the command from interpretation.   To  pass  a  $
       through to the shell you need to hide it with a backslash.

       Evaluating a filehandle in angle brackets yields the  next
       line from that file (newline included, so it's never false
       until EOF, at which time an undefined value is  returned).
       Ordinarily  you  must assign that value to a variable, but
       there is one situation where an automatic assignment  hap-
       pens.  If (and only if) the input symbol is the only thing
       inside the conditional of a _w_h_i_l_e loop, the value is auto-
       matically  assigned  to the variable "$_".  (This may seem
       like an odd thing to you, but you'll use the construct  in
       almost  every _p_e_r_l script you write.)  Anyway, the follow-
       ing lines are equivalent to each other:

           while ($_ = <STDIN>) { print; }
           while (<STDIN>) { print; }
           for (;<STDIN>;) { print; }
           print while $_ = <STDIN>;
           print while <STDIN>;

       The filehandles _S_T_D_I_N, _S_T_D_O_U_T and _S_T_D_E_R_R  are  predefined.
       (The  filehandles  _s_t_d_i_n, _s_t_d_o_u_t and _s_t_d_e_r_r will also work
       except in packages, where they  would  be  interpreted  as
       local  identifiers  rather than global.)  Additional file-
       handles may be created with the _o_p_e_n function.

       If a <FILEHANDLE> is used in a context that is looking for
       an  array,  an  array consisting of all the input lines is
       returned, one line per array element.  It's easy to make a
       LARGE data space this way, so use with care.

       The  null filehandle <> is special and can be used to emu-
       late the behavior of _s_e_d and _a_w_k.   Input  from  <>  comes
       either  from  standard  input, or from each file listed on
       the command line.  Here's how it works: the first time  <>
       is  evaluated,  the  ARGV  array  is checked, and if it is
       null, $ARGV[0] is set to '-', which when opened gives  you
       standard  input.   The  ARGV  array is then processed as a
       list of filenames.  The loop

                 ...            # code for each line

            unshift(@ARGV, '-') if $#ARGV < $[;
            while ($ARGV = shift) {
                 open(ARGV, $ARGV);

                 }
            }

       except that it isn't as cumbersome to say, and will  actu-
       ally  work.   It  really does shift array ARGV and put the
       current filename into variable ARGV.  It also  uses  file-
       handle  ARGV  internally--<> is just a synonym for <ARGV>,
       which is magical.  (The pseudo  code  above  doesn't  work
       because it treats <ARGV> as non-magical.)

       You  can  modify  @ARGV before the first <> as long as the
       array ends up containing the list of filenames you  really
       want.   Line numbers ($.) continue as if the input was one
       big happy file.  (But see example under  eof  for  how  to
       reset line numbers on each file.)

       If  you  want  to  set @ARGV to your own list of files, go
       right ahead.  If you  want  to  pass  switches  into  your
       script, you can put a loop on the front like this:

            while ($_ = $ARGV[0], /^-/) {
                 shift;
                last if /^--$/;
                 /^-D(.*)/ && ($debug = $1);
                 /^-v/ && $verbose++;
                 ...       # other switches
            }
            while (<>) {
                 ...       # code for each line
            }

       The <> symbol will return FALSE only once.  If you call it
       again after this it will assume you are processing another
       @ARGV  list, and if you haven't set @ARGV, will input from
       _S_T_D_I_N.

       If the string inside the angle brackets is a reference  to
       a  scalar  variable (e.g. <$foo>), then that variable con-
       tains the name of the filehandle to input from.

       If the string inside angle brackets is not  a  filehandle,
       it is interpreted as a filename pattern to be globbed, and
       either an array of filenames or the next filename  in  the
       list  is  returned,  depending on context.  One level of $
       interpretation is done first, but  you  can't  say  <$foo>
       because  that's an indirect filehandle as explained in the
       previous paragraph.  You could insert  curly  brackets  to
       force  interpretation as a filename glob: <${foo}>.  Exam-
       ple:

            while (<*.c>) {
                 chmod 0644, $_;
            }

       is equivalent to

            open(foo, "echo *.c | tr -s ' \t\r\f' '\\012\\012\\012\\012'|");
            while (<foo>) {
                 chop;
                 chmod 0644, $_;
            }

       In fact, it's  currently  implemented  that  way.   (Which
       means  it  will  not work on filenames with spaces in them
       unless you have /bin/csh on your machine.)  Of course, the
       shortest way to do the above is:

            chmod 0644, <*.c>;


       SSyynnttaaxx


       A  _p_e_r_l  script consists of a sequence of declarations and
       commands.  The only things that need  to  be  declared  in
       _p_e_r_l are report formats and subroutines.  See the sections
       below for more information  on  those  declarations.   All
       uninitialized  user-created  objects  are assumed to start
       with a null or 0 value until  they  are  defined  by  some
       explicit  operation  such  as assignment.  The sequence of
       commands is executed just once,  unlike  in  _s_e_d  and  _a_w_k
       scripts,  where  the  sequence of commands is executed for
       each input line.  While this means that you  must  explic-
       itly loop over the lines of your input file (or files), it
       also means you have much more control over which files and
       which lines you look at.  (Actually, I'm lying--it is pos-
       sible to do an implicit loop with  either  the  --nn  or  --pp
       switch.)

       A  declaration  can be put anywhere a command can, but has
       no effect on the execution  of  the  primary  sequence  of

       commands--declarations  all  take  effect at compile time.
       Typically all the declarations are put at the beginning or
       the end of the script.

       _P_e_r_l  is,  for  the most part, a free-form language.  (The
       only exception to this is format declarations, for  fairly
       obvious reasons.)  Comments are indicated by the # charac-
       ter, and extend to the end of the line.  If you attempt to
       use  /*  */  C  comments, it will be interpreted either as
       division or pattern matching, depending  on  the  context.
       So don't do that.

       CCoommppoouunndd ssttaatteemmeennttss

       In _p_e_r_l, a sequence of commands may be treated as one com-
       mand by enclosing it in curly brackets.  We will call this
       a BLOCK.

       The  following  compound  commands  may be used to control
       flow:

            if (EXPR) BLOCK
            if (EXPR) BLOCK else BLOCK
            if (EXPR) BLOCK elsif (EXPR) BLOCK ... else BLOCK
            LABEL while (EXPR) BLOCK
            LABEL while (EXPR) BLOCK continue BLOCK
            LABEL for (EXPR; EXPR; EXPR) BLOCK
            LABEL foreach VAR (ARRAY) BLOCK
            LABEL BLOCK continue BLOCK

       Note that, unlike C and Pascal, these are defined in terms
       of  BLOCKs,  not  statements.   This  means that the curly
       brackets are _r_e_q_u_i_r_e_d--no dangling statements allowed.  If
       you  want  to  write  conditionals  without curly brackets
       there are several other ways to do it.  The following  all
       do the same thing:

            if (!open(foo)) { die "Can't open $foo: $!"; }
            die "Can't open $foo: $!" unless open(foo);
            open(foo) || die "Can't open $foo: $!"; # foo or bust!
            open(foo) ? 'hi mom' : die "Can't open $foo: $!";
                           # a bit exotic, that last one


       The  _i_f  statement  is  straightforward.  Since BLOCKs are
       always bounded by curly brackets, there is never any ambi-
       guity about which _i_f an _e_l_s_e goes with.  If you use _u_n_l_e_s_s
       in place of _i_f, the sense of the test is reversed.

       The _w_h_i_l_e statement executes the  block  as  long  as  the
       expression  is  true (does not evaluate to the null string

       or 0).  The LABEL is optional, and if present, consists of
       an  identifier  followed by a colon.  The LABEL identifies
       the loop for the loop control statements _n_e_x_t,  _l_a_s_t,  and
       _r_e_d_o  (see  below).   If  there is a _c_o_n_t_i_n_u_e BLOCK, it is
       always executed just before the conditional is about to be
       evaluated again, similarly to the third part of a _f_o_r loop
       in C.  Thus it can be used to increment a  loop  variable,
       even  when the loop has been continued via the _n_e_x_t state-
       ment (similar to the C "continue" statement).

       If the word _w_h_i_l_e is replaced by the word _u_n_t_i_l, the sense
       of  the  test  is  reversed,  but the conditional is still
       tested before the first iteration.

       In either the _i_f or the _w_h_i_l_e statement, you  may  replace
       "(EXPR)"  with a BLOCK, and the conditional is true if the
       value of the last command in that block is true.

       The _f_o_r loop works exactly like  the  corresponding  _w_h_i_l_e
       loop:

            for ($i = 1; $i < 10; $i++) {
                 ...
            }

       is the same as

            $i = 1;
            while ($i < 10) {
                 ...
            } continue {
                 $i++;
            }

       The  foreach  loop  iterates over a normal array value and
       sets the variable VAR to be each element of the  array  in
       turn.   The  variable is implicitly local to the loop, and
       regains its former  value  upon  exiting  the  loop.   The
       "foreach"  keyword is actually identical to the "for" key-
       word, so you can use "foreach" for  readability  or  "for"
       for  brevity.  If VAR is omitted, $_ is set to each value.
       If ARRAY is an actual array (as opposed to  an  expression
       returning  an array value), you can modify each element of
       the array by modifying VAR inside the loop.  Examples:

            for (@ary) { s/foo/bar/; }

            foreach $elem (@elements) {
                 $elem *= 2;
            }

            for ((10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,'BOOM')) {
                 print $_, "\n"; sleep(1);
            }

            for (1..15) { print "Merry Christmas\n"; }

            foreach $item (split(/:[\\\n:]*/, $ENV{'TERMCAP'})) {
                 print "Item: $item\n";
            }


       The BLOCK by itself (labeled or not) is  equivalent  to  a
       loop that executes once.  Thus you can use any of the loop
       control statements in it to leave or  restart  the  block.
       The _c_o_n_t_i_n_u_e block is optional.  This construct is partic-
       ularly nice for doing case structures.

            foo: {
                 if (/^abc/) { $abc = 1; last foo; }
                 if (/^def/) { $def = 1; last foo; }
                 if (/^xyz/) { $xyz = 1; last foo; }
                 $nothing = 1;
            }

       There is no official switch  statement  in  perl,  because
       there  are  already  several ways to write the equivalent.
       In addition to the above, you could write

            foo: {
                 $abc = 1, last foo  if /^abc/;
                 $def = 1, last foo  if /^def/;
                 $xyz = 1, last foo  if /^xyz/;
                 $nothing = 1;
            }

       or

            foo: {
                 /^abc/ && do { $abc = 1; last foo; };
                 /^def/ && do { $def = 1; last foo; };
                 /^xyz/ && do { $xyz = 1; last foo; };

            foo: {

                 $nothing = 1;

       or even

            if (/^abc/)
                 { $abc = 1; }
            elsif (/^def/)

                 { $xyz = 1; }
            else
                 {$nothing = 1;}

       As it happens, these are all  optimized  internally  to  a
       switch  structure,  so  perl jumps directly to the desired
       statement, and you needn't worry about  perl  executing  a
       lot of unnecessary statements when you have a string of 50
       elsifs, as long as you are testing the same simple  scalar
       variable  using ==, eq, or pattern matching as above.  (If
       you're curious as to whether the optimizer has  done  this
       for  a  particular  case statement, you can use the -D1024
       switch to list the syntax tree before execution.)

       The only kind of simple statement is an expression  evalu-
       ated for its side effects.  Every simple statement must be
       terminated with a semicolon, unless it is the final state-
       ment  in a block, in which case the semicolon is optional.
       (Semicolon is still encouraged there if the block takes up
       more than one line).

       Any  simple statement may optionally be followed by a sin-
       gle modifier, just before the terminating semicolon.   The
       possible modifiers are:

            if EXPR
            unless EXPR

            until EXPR

       The  _i_f  and _u_n_l_e_s_s modifiers have the expected semantics.
       The _w_h_i_l_e and  _u_n_t_i_l  modifiers  also  have  the  expected
       semantics   (conditional  evaluated  first),  except  when
       applied to a do-BLOCK or a do-SUBROUTINE command, in which
       case  the  block  executes  once before the conditional is

       **      The exponentiation operator.

               mnemonic  just think of "eq" as a string.  (If you
               are used to the  _a_w_k  behavior  of  using  ==  for
               either  string  or  numeric  equality based on the
               current form of the comparands, beware!  You  must
               be explicit here.)

       ne      String inequality (!= is numeric inequality).

               "$_" by default.  This operator makes that kind of
               operation  work  on  some other string.  The right
               argument is a  search  pattern,  substitution,  or
               translation.   The  left  argument is what is sup-
               posed to be searched, substituted,  or  translated
               instead  of  the  default  "$_".  The return value
               indicates the success of the operation.   (If  the
               right  argument  is  an  expression  other  than a
               search pattern, substitution, or  translation,  it
               is  interpreted  as  a search pattern at run time.
               This is less efficient than  an  explicit  search,
               since  the pattern must be compiled every time the
               expression is evaluated.)  The precedence of  this
               operator  is lower than unary minus and autoincre-
               ment/decrement, but higher than everything else.

       !~      Just like =~ except the return value is negated.

       x       The repetition operator.  Returns  a  string  con-
               sisting of the left operand repeated the number of
               times specified by the right operand.  In an array
               context,  if the left operand is a list in parens,
               it repeats the list.

                    @ones = (5) x @ones;          # set all elements to 5


       x=      The repetition assignment operator.  Only works on
               scalars.

       ..      The  range operator, which is really two different
               operators depending on the context.  In  an  array
               context,  returns  an array of values counting (by
               ones) from the left  value  to  the  right  value.
               This is useful for writing "for (1..10)" loops and
               for doing slice operations on arrays.

               In a scalar context, .. returns a  boolean  value.
               The  operator  is  bistable, like a flip-flop, and
               emulates the line-range (comma) operator  of  sed,
               awk,  and various editors.  Each .. operator main-
               tains its own boolean state.  It is false as  long
               as  its  left  operand  is  false.   Once the left
               operand is true, the  range  operator  stays  true
               until  the  right operand is true, AFTER which the

               (...)  instead  of two.)  The right operand is not
               evaluated while the operator  is  in  the  "false"
               state, and the left operand is not evaluated while
               the operator is in the "true" state.   The  prece-
               dence is a little lower than || and &&.  The value
               returned is either the null string for false, or a
               sequence  number (beginning with 1) for true.  The
               sequence number is reset for  each  range  encoun-
               tered.   The  final sequence number in a range has
               the string 'E0'  appended  to  it,  which  doesn't
               affect  its numeric value, but gives you something
               to search for if you want to exclude the endpoint.
               You can exclude the beginning point by waiting for
               the sequence number to  be  greater  than  1.   If
               either  operand  of  scalar  ..  is  static,  that
               operand is implicitly compared to the $. variable,
               the current line number.  Examples:

               As a scalar operator:
                   if (101 .. 200) { print; }     # print 2nd hundred lines

                   next line if (1 .. /^$/); # skip header lines

                   s/^/> / if (/^$/ .. eof());    # quote body

               As an array operator:
                   for (101 .. 200) { print; }    # print $_ 100 times

                   @foo = @foo[$[ .. $#foo]; # an expensive no-op
                   @foo = @foo[$#foo-4 .. $#foo]; # slice last 5 items


       -x      A  file test.  This unary operator takes one argu-
               ment, either a filename or a filehandle, and tests
               the  associated  file  to see if something is true
               about it.  If the argument is omitted,  tests  $_,
               except  for  -t,  which tests _S_T_D_I_N.  It returns 1
               for true and '' for false, or the undefined  value
               if  the  file doesn't exist.  Precedence is higher
               than logical and relational operators,  but  lower
               than  arithmetic  operators.   The operator may be
               any of:
                    -r   File is readable by effective uid/gid.
                    -w   File is writable by effective uid/gid.

                    -B   File is a binary file (opposite of -T).
                    -M   Age of file in days when script started.
                    -A   Same for access time.
                    -C   Same for inode change time.

               The interpretation of the file  permission  opera-
               tors  -r, -R, -w, -W, -x and -X is based solely on
               the mode of the file and the uids and gids of  the
               user.   There may be other reasons you can't actu-
               ally read, write or execute the file.   Also  note
               that,  for the superuser, -r, -R, -w and -W always
               return 1, and -x and -X return 1  if  any  execute
               bit  is set in the mode.  Scripts run by the supe-
               ruser may thus need to do a  stat()  in  order  to
               determine  the  actual  mode  of the file, or tem-
               porarily set the uid to something else.

               Example:

                    while (<>) {
                         chop;
                         next unless -f $_;  # ignore specials
                         ...
                    }

               Note that -s/a/b/ does not do a negated  substitu-
               tion.   Saying -exp($foo) still works as expected,
               however--only single letters following a minus are
               interpreted as file tests.

               The -T and -B switches work as follows.  The first
               block or so of the file is examined for odd  char-
               acters  such as strange control codes or metachar-
               acters.  If too many  odd  characters  (>10%)  are
               found,  it's  a -B file, otherwise it's a -T file.
               Also, any file containing null in the first  block
               is  considered a binary file.  If -T or -B is used
               on a filehandle, the current stdio buffer is exam-
               ined  rather than the first block.  Both -T and -B
               return TRUE on a null file, or a file at EOF  when
               testing a filehandle.

       If  any  of  the  file tests (or either stat operator) are
       given the special  filehandle  consisting  of  a  solitary
       underline,  then  the  stat structure of the previous file
       test (or stat operator) is used,  saving  a  system  call.
       (This  doesn't work with -t, and you need to remember that
       lstat and -l will leave values in the stat  structure  for
       the symbolic link, not the real file.)  Example:

            print "Can do.\n" if -r $a || -w _ || -x _;

            stat($filename);
            print "Readable\n" if -r _;
            print "Writable\n" if -w _;
            print "Executable\n" if -x _;
            print "Setuid\n" if -u _;
            print "Setgid\n" if -g _;
            print "Sticky\n" if -k _;
            print "Text\n" if -T _;
            print "Binary\n" if -B _;


       Here is what C has that _p_e_r_l doesn't:

       unary &     Address-of operator.

       unary *     Dereference-address operator.

       (TYPE)      Type casting operator.

       Like  C,  _p_e_r_l does a certain amount of expression evalua-
       tion at compile time, whenever it determines that  all  of
       the  arguments  to an operator are static and have no side
       effects.  In particular, string concatenation  happens  at
       compile  time between literals that don't do variable sub-
       stitution.  Backslash interpretation also happens at  com-
       pile time.  You can say

            'Now is the time for all' . "\n" .
            'good men to come to.'

       and this all reduces to one string internally.

       The  autoincrement  operator  has  a little extra built-in
       magic to it.  If you increment a variable that is numeric,
       or that has ever been used in a numeric context, you get a
       normal increment.  If, however, the variable has only been
       used  in string contexts since it was set, and has a value
       that   is   not   null    and    matches    the    pattern
       /^[a-zA-Z]*[0-9]*$/,  the  increment  is done as a string,
       preserving each character within its range, with carry:

            print ++($foo = '99');   # prints '100'
            print ++($foo = 'a0');   # prints 'a1'
            print ++($foo = 'Az');   # prints 'Ba'
            print ++($foo = 'zz');   # prints 'aaa'

       The autodecrement is not magical.

       The range operator (in an array context) makes use of  the
       magical autoincrement algorithm if the minimum and maximum
       are strings.  You can say

            @alphabet = ('A' .. 'Z');

       to get all the letters of the alphabet, or

            $hexdigit = (0 .. 9, 'a' .. 'f')[$num & 15];

       to get a hexadecimal digit, or

            @z2 = ('01' .. '31');  print @z2[$mday];

       to get dates with leading  zeros.   (If  the  final  value
       specified  is  not in the sequence that the magical incre-
       ment would produce, the sequence goes until the next value
       would be longer than the final value specified.)

       The  ||  and  && operators differ from C's in that, rather
       than returning 0 or 1, they return the last  value  evalu-
       ated.  Thus, a portable way to find out the home directory
       might be:

            $home = $ENV{'HOME'} || $ENV{'LOGDIR'} ||
                (getpwuid($<))[7] || die "You're homeless!\n";


       Along with the literals and variables  mentioned  earlier,
       the operations in the following section can serve as terms
       in an expression.  Some of these operations take a LIST as
       an  argument.   Such a list can consist of any combination
       of scalar arguments or array values; the array values will

       be included in the list as if each individual element were
       interpolated at that point in the list, forming  a  longer
       single-dimensional  array  value.   Elements  of  the LIST
       should be separated by commas.  If an operation is  listed
       both with and without parentheses around its arguments, it
       means you can either use it as a unary operator  or  as  a
       function  call.   To  use  it as a function call, the next
       token on the same line must be a left parenthesis.  (There
       may be intervening white space.)  Such a function then has
       highest precedence, as you would expect from  a  function.
       If  any  token other than a left parenthesis follows, then
       it is a unary operator, with a precedence  depending  only
       on  whether  it is a LIST operator or not.  LIST operators
       have lowest precedence.  All other unary operators have  a
       precedence greater than relational operators but less than
       arithmetic operators.  See the section on Precedence.

       For operators that can be used in either a scalar or array
       context,  failure  is generally indicated in a scalar con-
       text by returning the undefined value,  and  in  an  array
       context  by returning the null list.  Remember though that
       THERE IS NO GENERAL RULE FOR  CONVERTING  A  LIST  INTO  A
       SCALAR.   Each  operator  decides  which sort of scalar it
       would be  most  appropriate  to  return.   Some  operators
       return  the  length  of  the  list  that  would  have been
       returned in an array context.  Some operators  return  the
       first  value  in the list.  Some operators return the last
       value in the list.  Some operators return a count of  suc-
       cessful  operations.   In  general, they do what you want,
       unless you want consistency.

       /PATTERN/
               See m/PATTERN/.

       ?PATTERN?
               This is just like  the  /pattern/  search,  except
               that  it  matches  only  once between calls to the
               _r_e_s_e_t operator.  This  is  a  useful  optimization
               when  you only want to see the first occurrence of
               something in each file of  a  set  of  files,  for
               instance.   Only  ?? patterns local to the current
               package are reset.

       accept(NEWSOCKET,GENERICSOCKET)
               Does the same thing that the  accept  system  call
               does.   Returns true if it succeeded, false other-

               munication.

               1,  actually)  have elapsed.  Thus, alarm(15) will
               cause a SIGALRM at some point more than 14 seconds
               in  the future.  Only one timer may be counting at
               once.  Each call disables the previous timer,  and
               an  argument  of  0  may be supplied to cancel the
               previous timer without starting a  new  one.   The
               returned  value is the amount of time remaining on
               the previous timer.

       bind(SOCKET,NAME)
               Does  the  same  thing  that  the bind system call
               does.  Returns true if it succeeded, false  other-
               wise.   NAME  should  be  a  packed address of the
               proper type for the socket.  See example  in  sec-

       binmode(FILEHANDLE)

       binmode FILEHANDLE
               Arranges  for the file to be read in "binary" mode
               in  operating  systems  that  distinguish  between
               binary and text files.  Files that are not read in
               binary mode have CR LF sequences translated to  LF
               on  input  and  LF  translated to CR LF on output.
               Binmode has no effect under Unix.   If  FILEHANDLE
               is  an  expression, the value is taken as the name
               of the filehandle.

       chop VARIABLE

       chop    Chops off the  last  character  of  a  string  and
               returns  the character chopped.  It's used primar-
               ily to remove the newline from the end of an input
               record,  but  is  much  more efficient than s/\n//
               because it neither scans nor  copies  the  string.
               If VARIABLE is omitted, chops $_.  Example:

                    while (<>) {
                         chop;     # avoid \n on last field
                         @array = split(/:/);
                         ...
                    }

               You  can  actually chop anything that's an lvalue,
               including an assignment:

                    chop($cwd = `pwd`);
                    chop($answer = <STDIN>);

               If you chop a list, each element is chopped.  Only
               the value of the last chop is returned.

               in the passwd file:

                    print "User: ";
                    $user = <STDIN>;
                    chop($user);
                    print "Files: "
                    $pattern = <STDIN>;
                    chop($pattern);
                    open(pass, '/etc/passwd')
                         || die "Can't open passwd: $!\n";
                    while (<pass>) {
                         ($login,$pass,$uid,$gid) = split(/:/);
                         $uid{$login} = $uid;
                         $gid{$login} = $gid;
                    }
                    @ary = <${pattern}>;     # get filenames
                    if ($uid{$user} eq '') {
                         die "$user not in passwd file";
                    }
                    else {
                         chown $uid{$user}, $gid{$user}, @ary;
                    }


       chroot(FILENAME)

       chroot FILENAME
               Does the same as the system call of that name.  If
               you don't know what it does, don't worry about it.
               If FILENAME is omitted, does chroot to $_.

       close(FILEHANDLE)

       close FILEHANDLE
               Closes  the  file or pipe associated with the file
               handle.  You don't have to close FILEHANDLE if you
               are  immediately  going  to do another open on it,
               since open will close it  for  you.   (See  _o_p_e_n.)
               However, an explicit close on an input file resets
               the line counter ($.), while  the  implicit  close
               done  by _o_p_e_n does not.  Also, closing a pipe will
               wait for the process executing on the pipe to com-
               plete,  in  case you want to look at the output of
               the pipe afterwards.  Closing  a  pipe  explicitly

               also puts the status value of the command into $?.
               Example:

                    open(OUTPUT, '|sort >foo');   # pipe to sort
                    ...  # print stuff to output
                    close OUTPUT;       # wait for sort to finish
                    open(INPUT, 'foo'); # get sort's results

               FILEHANDLE may be an expression whose value  gives
               the real filehandle name.

       closedir(DIRHANDLE)

       closedir DIRHANDLE
               Closes a directory opened by opendir().

       connect(SOCKET,NAME)
               Does  the  same thing that the connect system call
               does.  Returns true if it succeeded, false  other-
               wise.   NAME  should  be  a package address of the
               proper type for the socket.  See example  in  sec-
               tion on Interprocess Communication.

       cos(EXPR)

       cos EXPR
               Returns the cosine of EXPR (expressed in radians).
               If EXPR is omitted takes cosine of $_.

       crypt(PLAINTEXT,SALT)
               Encrypts a string exactly like the  crypt()  func-
               tion  in  the  C library.  Useful for checking the
               password file for lousy passwords.  Only the  guys
               wearing white hats should do this.

       dbmclose(ASSOC_ARRAY)

       dbmclose ASSOC_ARRAY
               Breaks the binding between a dbm file and an asso-
               ciative array.  The values remaining in the  asso-
               ciative array are meaningless unless you happen to
               want to know what was in the  cache  for  the  dbm
               file.   This  function  is only useful if you have
               ndbm.

       dbmopen(ASSOC,DBNAME,MODE)
               This binds a dbm or ndbm file  to  an  associative
               array.   ASSOC  is  the  name  of  the associative
               array.  (Unlike normal open, the first argument is
               NOT  a filehandle, even though it looks like one).
               DBNAME is the name of the  database  (without  the

               .dir or .pag extension).  If the database does not
               exist, it is created with protection specified  by
               MODE  (as  modified by the umask).  If your system
               only supports the older  dbm  functions,  you  may
               perform only one dbmopen in your program.  If your
               system has neither dbm nor ndbm,  calling  dbmopen
               produces a fatal error.

               Values  assigned to the associative array prior to
               the dbmopen are lost.  A certain number of  values
               from  the  dbm  file  are  cached  in  memory.  By
               default this number is 64, but you can increase it
               by preallocating that number of garbage entries in
               the associative array before the dbmopen.  You can
               flush  the  cache if necessary with the reset com-
               mand.

               If you don't have write access to  the  dbm  file,
               you can only read associative array variables, not
               set them.  If you want to  test  whether  you  can
               write,  either  use  file  tests  or try setting a
               dummy array entry inside an eval, which will  trap
               the error.

               Note  that  functions  such as keys() and values()
               may return huge array values when  used  on  large
               dbm files.  You may prefer to use the each() func-
               tion to iterate over large dbm files.  Example:

                    # print out history file offsets
                    dbmopen(HIST,'/usr/lib/news/history',0666);
                    while (($key,$val) = each %HIST) {
                         print $key, ' = ', unpack('L',$val), "\n";
                    }
                    dbmclose(HIST);


       defined(EXPR)

       defined EXPR
               Returns a boolean value saying whether the  lvalue
               EXPR  has  a  real  value or not.  Many operations
               return the undefined value under exceptional  con-
               ditions,  such as end of file, uninitialized vari-
               able, system error and such.  This function allows
               you  to  distinguish  between  an  undefined  null
               string and a defined null string  with  operations
               that  might return a real null string, in particu-
               lar referencing elements of  an  array.   You  may
               also  check to see if arrays or subroutines exist.

               produce intuitive results.  Examples:

                    print if defined $switch{'D'};
                    print "$val\n" while defined($val = pop(@ary));
                    die "Can't readlink $sym: $!"
                         unless defined($value = readlink $sym);
                    eval '@foo = ()' if defined(@foo);
                    die "No XYZ package defined" unless defined %_XYZ;
                    sub foo { defined &$bar ? &$bar(@_) : die "No bar"; }

               See also undef.

       delete $ASSOC{KEY}
               Deletes  the  specified  value  from the specified
               associative array.  Returns the deleted value,  or
               the   undefined  value  if  nothing  was  deleted.
               Deleting from  $ENV{}  modifies  the  environment.
               Deleting from an array bound to a dbm file deletes
               the entry from the dbm file.

               The following deletes all the values of  an  asso-
               ciative array:

                    foreach $key (keys %ARRAY) {
                         delete $ARRAY{$key};
                    }

               (But  it would be faster to use the _r_e_s_e_t command.
               Saying undef %ARRAY is faster yet.)

       die(LIST)

       die LIST
               Outside of an eval, prints the value  of  LIST  to
               _S_T_D_E_R_R  and  exits  with  the  current value of $!
               (errno).  If $! is 0, exits with the value of  ($?
               >>  8)  (`command`  status).   If  ($? >> 8) is 0,
               exits with 255.  Inside an eval, the error message
               is stuffed into $@ and the eval is terminated with
               the undefined value.

               Equivalent examples:

                    die "Can't cd to spool: $!\n"
                         unless chdir '/usr/spool/news';

                    chdir '/usr/spool/news' || die "Can't cd to spool: $!\n"

               number (if any) are also printed, and a newline is
               supplied.   Hint:  sometimes appending ", stopped"
               to your message will cause it to make better sense
               when  the  string  "at  foo line 123" is appended.
               Suppose you are running script "canasta".

                    die "/etc/games is no good";
                    die "/etc/games is no good, stopped";

               produce, respectively

                    /etc/games is no good at canasta line 123.
                    /etc/games is no good, stopped at canasta line 123.

       do BLOCK
               Returns the value  of  the  last  command  in  the
               sequence  of  commands  indicated  by BLOCK.  When
               modified by a loop modifier,  executes  the  BLOCK
               once before testing the loop condition.  (On other
               statements the loop modifiers test the conditional
               first.)

       do SUBROUTINE (LIST)
               Executes  a  SUBROUTINE declared by a _s_u_b declara-
               tion, and returns the value of the last expression
               evaluated  in  SUBROUTINE.  If there is no subrou-
               tine by that name, produces a fatal  error.   (You
               may  use  the "defined" operator to determine if a
               subroutine exists.)  If you pass arrays as part of
               LIST  you may wish to pass the length of the array
               in front of each array.  (See the section on  sub-
               routines  later on.)  The parentheses are required
               to avoid confusion with the "do EXPR" form.

               SUBROUTINE may also be a single  scalar  variable,
               in  which  case the name of the subroutine to exe-
               cute is taken from the variable.

               As an alternate (and preferred) form, you may call
               a  subroutine by prefixing the name with an amper-
               sand: &foo(@args).   If  you  aren't  passing  any
               arguments,  you don't have to use parentheses.  If
               you omit the parentheses, no @_ array is passed to
               the  subroutine.  The & form is also used to spec-
               ify subroutines to the defined  and  undef  opera-
               tors:

                    if (defined &$var) { &$var($parm); undef &$var; }

       do EXPR Uses  the value of EXPR as a filename and executes
               the contents of the file as a  _p_e_r_l  script.   Its
               primary  use is to include subroutines from a _p_e_r_l
               subroutine library.

                    do 'stat.pl';

               is just like

                    eval `cat stat.pl`;

               except that it's  more  efficient,  more  concise,
               keeps track of the current filename for error mes-
               sages, and searches all the --II  libraries  if  the
               file  isn't in the current directory (see also the
               @INC array in Predefined Names).  It's  the  same,
               however,  in  that  it does reparse the file every
               time you call it, so if you are going to  use  the
               file  inside a loop you might prefer to use -P and
               #include, at the expense of a little more  startup
               time.  (The main problem with #include is that cpp
               doesn't grok # comments--a workaround  is  to  use
               ";#" for standalone comments.)  Note that the fol-
               lowing are NOT equivalent:

                    do $foo;  # eval a file
                    do $foo();     # call a subroutine

               Note that inclusion of library routines is  better
               done with the "require" operator.

       dump LABEL
               This  causes  an  immediate  core dump.  Primarily
               this is so that you can use the undump program  to
               turn  your  core  dump  into  an executable binary
               after having initialized all your variables at the
               beginning  of the program.  When the new binary is
               executed it will begin by executing a "goto LABEL"
               (with  all  the  restrictions  that goto suffers).
               Think of it as a goto  with  an  intervening  core
               dump  and  reincarnation.   If  LABEL  is omitted,
               restarts the program from the top.   WARNING:  any
               files  opened  at the time of the dump will NOT be
               open any more when the  program  is  reincarnated,
               with  possible  resulting confusion on the part of
               perl.  See also -u.

       each(ASSOC_ARRAY)

       each ASSOC_ARRAY
               Returns a 2 element array consisting  of  the  key
               and  value  for  the  next value of an associative
               array, so that you can iterate over  it.   Entries
               are  returned in an apparently random order.  When
               the array  is  entirely  read,  a  null  array  is
               returned (which when assigned produces a FALSE (0)
               value).  The next call to each() after  that  will
               start  iterating again.  The iterator can be reset
               only by reading all the elements from  the  array.
               You must not modify the array while iterating over
               it.  There is a single iterator for each  associa-
               tive  array, shared by all each(), keys() and val-
               ues() function calls in the program.  The  follow-
               ing  prints out your environment like the printenv
               program, only in a different order:

       eof(FILEHANDLE)

       eof()

       eof     Returns 1 if the  next  read  on  FILEHANDLE  will
               return  end of file, or if FILEHANDLE is not open.
               FILEHANDLE may be an expression whose value  gives
               the   real   filehandle  name.   (Note  that  this

               function  actually  reads  a  character  and  then
               ungetc's it, so it is not very useful in an inter-
               active  context.)   An  eof  without  an  argument
               returns  the  eof  status  for the last file read.
               Empty parentheses () may be used to  indicate  the
               pseudo file formed of the files listed on the com-
               mand line, i.e. eof() is reasonable to use  inside
               a  while  (<>)  loop to detect the end of only the
               last file.   Use  eof(ARGV)  or  eof  without  the
               parentheses  to  test  EACH  file  in a while (<>)
               loop.  Examples:

                    # insert dashes just before last line of last file
                    while (<>) {
                         if (eof()) {
                              print "--------------\n";
                         }
                         print;
                    }

                    # reset line numbering on each input file
                    while (<>) {
                         print "$.\t$_";
                         if (eof) {     # Not eof().
                              close(ARGV);
                         }
                    }


       eval(EXPR)

       eval EXPR

       eval BLOCK
               EXPR is parsed and executed as if it were a little
               _p_e_r_l  program.   It  is executed in the context of
               the current _p_e_r_l program,  so  that  any  variable
               settings,  subroutine or format definitions remain
               afterwards.  The value returned is  the  value  of
               the  last  expression evaluated, just as with sub-
               routines.  If there is a syntax error  or  runtime
               error,  or  a  die statement is executed, an unde-
               fined value is returned by eval, and $@ is set  to
               the  error  message.  If there was no error, $@ is
               guaranteed to be a null string.  If EXPR is  omit-
               ted,  evaluates  $_.  The final semicolon, if any,
               may be omitted from the expression.

               Note  that,  since  eval   traps   otherwise-fatal
               errors,  it  is  useful  for determining whether a
               particular feature (such as dbmopen or symlink) is

               implemented.  It is also Perl's exception trapping
               mechanism, where the die operator is used to raise
               exceptions.

               If  the  code to be executed doesn't vary, you may
               use the eval-BLOCK form to  trap  run-time  errors
               without  incurring the penalty of recompiling each
               time.  The error, if any, is still returned in $@.
               Evaluating  a  single-quoted  string (as EXPR) has
               the same effect, except that  the  eval-EXPR  form
               reports  syntax errors at run time via $@, whereas
               the eval-BLOCK form reports syntax errors at  com-
               pile  time.   The  eval-EXPR  form is optimized to
               eval-BLOCK the first time it succeeds.  (Since the
               replacement side of a substitution is considered a
               single-quoted string when you use the e  modifier,
               the same optimization occurs there.)  Examples:

                    # make divide-by-zero non-fatal
                    eval { $answer = $a / $b; }; warn $@ if $@;

                    # optimized to same thing after first use
                    eval '$answer = $a / $b'; warn $@ if $@;

                    # a compile-time error
                    eval { $answer = };

                    # a run-time error
                    eval '$answer =';   # sets $@


       exec(LIST)

       exec LIST
               If  there is more than one argument in LIST, or if
               LIST is an array with more than one  value,  calls
               execvp()  with the arguments in LIST.  If there is
               only one scalar argument, the argument is  checked
               for  shell  metacharacters.  If there are any, the
               entire argument is  passed  to  "/bin/sh  -c"  for
               parsing.  If there are none, the argument is split
               into words and passed directly to execvp(),  which
               is more efficient.  Note: exec (and system) do not
               flush your output buffer, so you may need  to  set
               $| to avoid lost output.  Examples:

                    exec '/bin/echo', 'Your arguments are: ', @ARGV;
                    exec "sort $outfile | uniq";

               argument, but want to lie to the program  you  are
               executing  about its own name, you can specify the
               program you actually want to run by assigning that
               to a variable and putting the name of the variable
               in front of  the  LIST  without  a  comma.   (This
               always  forces  interpretation  of  the  LIST as a
               multi-valued list, even if there is only a  single
               scalar in the list.)  Example:

                    $shell = '/bin/csh';
                    exec $shell '-sh';       # pretend it's a login shell


       exit(EXPR)

       exit EXPR
               Evaluates  EXPR  and  exits  immediately with that
               value.  Example:

                    $ans = <STDIN>;
                    exit 0 if $ans =~ /^[Xx]/;

               See also _d_i_e.  If EXPR is omitted,  exits  with  0
               status.

       exp(EXPR)

       exp EXPR
               Returns  _e to the power of EXPR.  If EXPR is omit-
               ted, gives exp($_).

       fcntl(FILEHANDLE,FUNCTION,SCALAR)
               Implements the fcntl(2) function.  You'll probably
               have to say

                    require "fcntl.ph"; # probably /usr/local/lib/perl/fcntl.ph

               first to get the correct function definitions.  If
               fcntl.ph doesn't exist or doesn't have the correct
               definitions you'll have to roll your own, based on
               your C header files such as <sys/fcntl.h>.  (There
               is  a  perl script called h2ph that comes with the
               perl kit which may help you  in  this.)   Argument
               processing  and value return works just like ioctl
               below.  Note that fcntl will produce a fatal error
               if  used  on  a  machine  that  doesn't  implement
               fcntl(2).

       fileno FILEHANDLE
               Returns the  file  descriptor  for  a  filehandle.
               Useful  for constructing bitmaps for select().  If
               FILEHANDLE is an expression, the value is taken as
               the name of the filehandle.

       flock(FILEHANDLE,OPERATION)
               Calls flock(2) on FILEHANDLE.  See manual page for
               flock(2) for  definition  of  OPERATION.   Returns
               true  for success, false on failure.  Will produce
               a fatal error if used on a  machine  that  doesn't
               implement flock(2).  Here's a mailbox appender for
               BSD systems.

       fork    Does a fork() call.  Returns the child pid to  the
               parent  process and 0 to the child process.  Note:
               unflushed buffers remain unflushed  in  both  pro-

               (If  the entry doesn't exist you get a null list.)

               Within a scalar context, you get the name,  unless
               the  function  was a lookup by name, in which case
               you get the other thing, whatever it is.  (If  the
               entry  doesn't exist you get the undefined value.)
               For example:

                    $uid = getpwnam
                    $name = getpwuid
                    $name = getpwent

                    etc.

               The $members value returned by getgr... is a space
               separated  list  of the login names of the members
               of the group.

               For the gethost... functions, if the h_errno vari-
               able is supported in C, it will be returned to you
               via $? if the function  call  fails.   The  @addrs
               value  returned  by a successful call is a list of
               the raw addresses returned  by  the  corresponding
               system library call.  In the Internet domain, each
               address is four bytes long and you can  unpack  it

       gmtime(EXPR)

       gmtime EXPR
               Converts  a  time as returned by the time function
               to a 9-element array with the  time  analyzed  for
               the  Greenwich  timezone.   Typically used as fol-
               lows:

               ($sec,$min,$hour,$mday,$mon,$year,$wday,$yday,$isdst) =
                                             gmtime(time);

               All array elements are numeric, and come  straight
               out of a struct tm.  In particular this means that
               $mon has the range 0..11 and $wday has  the  range
               0..6.  If EXPR is omitted, does gmtime(time).

               Finds the statement labeled with LABEL and resumes
               execution there.  Currently you  may  only  go  to
               statements  in  the  main body of the program that
               are not nested inside a  do  {}  construct.   This
               statement is not implemented very efficiently, and
               is here only to make  the  _s_e_d-to-_p_e_r_l  translator
               easier.   I  may change its semantics at any time,
               consistent  with  support   for   translated   _s_e_d
               scripts.   Use  it  at your own risk.  Better yet,
               don't use it at all.

       grep(EXPR,LIST)
               Evaluates EXPR for each element of  LIST  (locally
               setting  $_ to each element) and returns the array
               value consisting of those elements for  which  the
               expression  evaluated  to  true.  In a scalar con-
               text, returns the number of times  the  expression
               was true.

                    @foo = grep(!/^#/, @bar);    # weed out comments

               Note  that, since $_ is a reference into the array
               value, it can be used to modify  the  elements  of
               the array.  While this is useful and supported, it
               can cause bizarre results if the  LIST  is  not  a
               named array.

       hex EXPR
               Returns  the  decimal value of EXPR interpreted as
               an hex string.  (To interpret strings  that  might
               start  with  0 or 0x see oct().)  If EXPR is omit-
               ted, uses $_.

       index(STR,SUBSTR,POSITION)

       index(STR,SUBSTR)
               Returns the position of the  first  occurrence  of
               SUBSTR  in  STR at or after POSITION.  If POSITION
               is omitted, starts searching from the beginning of
               the  string.   The  return value is based at 0, or
               whatever you've set the $[ variable  to.   If  the
               substring  is not found, returns one less than the
               base, ordinarily -1.

       int(EXPR)

       int EXPR
               Returns the integer portion of EXPR.  If  EXPR  is
               omitted, uses $_.

       ioctl(FILEHANDLE,FUNCTION,SCALAR)
               Implements the ioctl(2) function.  You'll probably
               have to say

                    require "ioctl.ph"; # probably /usr/local/lib/perl/ioctl.ph

               first to get the correct function definitions.  If
               ioctl.ph doesn't exist or doesn't have the correct
               definitions you'll have to roll your own, based on
               your C header files such as <sys/ioctl.h>.  (There
               is a perl script called h2ph that comes  with  the
               perl kit which may help you in this.)  SCALAR will
               be read and/or  written  depending  on  the  FUNC-
               TION--a pointer to the string value of SCALAR will
               be passed as the  third  argument  of  the  actual
               ioctl  call.   (If  SCALAR has no string value but
               does have a numeric  value,  that  value  will  be
               passed  rather than a pointer to the string value.
               To guarantee this to be  true,  add  a  0  to  the
               scalar  before using it.)  The pack() and unpack()
               functions are useful for manipulating  the  values
               of  structures  used  by  ioctl().   The following
               example sets the erase character to DEL.

                    require 'ioctl.ph';
                    $sgttyb_t = "ccccs";          # 4 chars and a short
                    if (ioctl(STDIN,$TIOCGETP,$sgttyb)) {
                         @ary = unpack($sgttyb_t,$sgttyb);
                         $ary[2] = 127;
                         $sgttyb = pack($sgttyb_t,@ary);
                         ioctl(STDIN,$TIOCSETP,$sgttyb)
                              || die "Can't ioctl: $!";
                    }

               The return value of ioctl (and fcntl) is  as  fol-
               lows:

                    if OS returns:           perl returns:
                      -1                       undefined value
                      0                        string "0 but true"
                      anything else            that number

               Thus  perl  returns  true  on success and false on
               failure, yet you can still  easily  determine  the
               actual value returned by the operating system:

                    ($retval = ioctl(...)) || ($retval = -1);
                    printf "System returned %d\n", $retval;

       join(EXPR,LIST)

       join(EXPR,ARRAY)
               Joins the separate strings of LIST or ARRAY into a
               single string with fields separated by  the  value
               of EXPR, and returns the string.  Example:

               $_ = join(':',
                         $login,$passwd,$uid,$gid,$gcos,$home,$shell);

               See _s_p_l_i_t.

       keys(ASSOC_ARRAY)

       keys ASSOC_ARRAY
               Returns  a normal array consisting of all the keys
               of the named  associative  array.   The  keys  are
               returned  in an apparently random order, but it is
               the same order as either the  values()  or  each()
               function  produces  (given  that  the  associative
               array has not been modified).  Here is yet another
               way to print your environment:

                    @keys = keys %ENV;
                    @values = values %ENV;
                    while ($#keys >= 0) {
                         print pop(@keys), '=', pop(@values), "\n";
                    }

               or how about sorted by key:

                    foreach $key (sort(keys %ENV)) {
                         print $key, '=', $ENV{$key}, "\n";
                    }


       kill(LIST)

       kill LIST
               Sends  a signal to a list of processes.  The first
               element of the list must be the  signal  to  send.
               Returns  the number of processes successfully sig-
               naled.

                    $cnt = kill 1, $child1, $child2;
                    kill 9, @goners;

               If the signal is negative,  kills  process  groups
               instead  of  processes.   (On System V, a negative
               _p_r_o_c_e_s_s number will also kill process groups,  but
               that's  not  portable.)  You may use a signal name
               in quotes.

       last LABEL

       last    The _l_a_s_t command is like the _b_r_e_a_k statement in  C
               (as  used in loops); it immediately exits the loop
               in question.  If the LABEL is omitted, the command
               refers  to the innermost enclosing loop.  The _c_o_n_-
               _t_i_n_u_e block, if any, is not executed:

                    line: while (<STDIN>) {
                         last line if /^$/;  # exit when done with header
                         ...
                    }


       length(EXPR)

       length EXPR
               Returns the length in characters of the  value  of
               EXPR.  If EXPR is omitted, returns length of $_.

       link(OLDFILE,NEWFILE)
               Creates a new filename linked to the old filename.
               Returns 1 for success, 0 otherwise.

       listen(SOCKET,QUEUESIZE)
               Does the same thing that the  listen  system  call
               does.   Returns true if it succeeded, false other-
               wise.  See example in section on Interprocess Com-
               munication.

       local(LIST)
               Declares  the  listed variables to be local to the
               enclosing block, subroutine, eval  or  "do".   All
               the  listed  elements must be legal lvalues.  This
               operator works by saving  the  current  values  of
               those  variables  in  LIST  on  a hidden stack and
               restoring them upon exiting the block,  subroutine
               or  eval.   This means that called subroutines can
               also reference the local  variable,  but  not  the
               global  one.   The  LIST  may  be  assigned  to if
               desired, which allows you to initialize your local
               variables.  (If no initializer is given for a par-
               ticular variable, it is created with an  undefined
               value.)  Commonly this is used to name the parame-
               ters to a subroutine.  Examples:

                    sub RANGEVAL {
                         local($min, $max, $thunk) = @_;
                         local($result) = '';
                         local($i);

                         # Presumably $thunk makes reference to $i

                         for ($i = $min; $i < $max; $i++) {
                              $result .= eval $thunk;
                         }

                         $result;
                    }

                    if ($sw eq '-v') {
                        # init local array with global array
                        local(@ARGV) = @ARGV;
                        unshift(@ARGV,'echo');
                        system @ARGV;
                    }
                    # @ARGV restored

                    }

               Note that local() is a run-time  command,  and  so
               gets  executed every time through a loop, using up
               more  stack  storage  each  time  until  it's  all
               released at once when the loop is exited.

       localtime(EXPR)

       localtime EXPR
               Converts  a  time as returned by the time function
               to a 9-element array with the  time  analyzed  for
               the local timezone.  Typically used as follows:

               ($sec,$min,$hour,$mday,$mon,$year,$wday,$yday,$isdst) =
                                             localtime(time);

               All  array elements are numeric, and come straight
               out of a struct tm.  In particular this means that
               $mon  has  the range 0..11 and $wday has the range
               0..6.  If EXPR is omitted, does localtime(time).

       log(EXPR)

       log EXPR
               Returns logarithm (base _e) of EXPR.   If  EXPR  is
               omitted, returns log of $_.

       lstat(FILEHANDLE)

       lstat FILEHANDLE

       lstat(EXPR)

       lstat SCALARVARIABLE
               Does  the  same  thing as the stat() function, but
               stats a symbolic link instead of the file the sym-
               bolic link points to.  If symbolic links are unim-
               plemented on your system, a normal stat is done.

       m/PATTERN/gio

       /PATTERN/gio
               Searches a string for a pattern match, and returns
               true (1) or false ('').  If no string is specified
               via the =~  or  !~  operator,  the  $_  string  is

               searched.   (The string specified with =~ need not
               be an lvalue--it may be the result of  an  expres-
               sion  evaluation, but remember the =~ binds rather
               tightly.)  See also the section on regular expres-
               sions.

               If  /  is  the  delimiter  then the initial 'm' is
               optional.  With the 'm' you can use  any  pair  of
               non-alphanumeric  characters  as delimiters.  This
               is particularly  useful  for  matching  Unix  path
               names that contain '/'.  If the final delimiter is
               followed by the optional letter 'i', the  matching
               is done in a case-insensitive manner.  PATTERN may
               contain references to scalar variables, which will
               be interpolated (and the pattern recompiled) every
               time the pattern search is evaluated.  (Note  that
               $)  and  $|  may  not be interpolated because they
               look like end-of-string tests.)  If you want  such
               a  pattern  to  be  compiled only once, add an "o"
               after the trailing delimiter.  This avoids  expen-
               sive  run-time  recompilations, and is useful when
               the value you are interpolating won't change  over
               the  life of the script.  If the PATTERN evaluates
               to a null string, the most recent successful regu-
               lar expression is used instead.

               If used in a context that requires an array value,
               a pattern match returns an array consisting of the
               subexpressions  matched  by the parentheses in the
               pattern, i.e. ($1, $2, $3...).  It does NOT  actu-
               ally  set  $1,  $2, etc. in this case, nor does it
               set $+, $`, $& or $'.  If the match fails, a  null
               array  is  returned.   If  the match succeeds, but
               there were no parentheses, an array value  of  (1)
               is returned.

               Examples:

                   open(tty, '/dev/tty');
                   <tty> =~ /^y/i && do foo();    # do foo if desired

                   if (/Version: *([0-9.]*)/) { $version = $1; }

                   next if m#^/usr/spool/uucp#;

                   # poor man's grep
                   $arg = shift;
                   while (<>) {
                        print if /$arg/o;    # compile only once
                   }

                   if (($F1, $F2, $Etc) = ($foo =~ /^(\S+)\s+(\S+)\s*(.*)/))

               This  last  example splits $foo into the first two
               words and the remainder of the line,  and  assigns
               those three fields to $F1, $F2 and $Etc.  The con-
               ditional is true if any variables  were  assigned,
               i.e. if the pattern matched.

               The  "g"  modifier specifies global pattern match-
               ing--that is, matching as many times  as  possible
               within  the string.  How it behaves depends on the
               context.  In an array context, it returns  a  list
               of all the substrings matched by all the parenthe-
               ses in the regular expression.  If  there  are  no
               parentheses,  it returns a list of all the matched
               strings, as if there were parentheses  around  the
               whole  pattern.   In a scalar context, it iterates
               through the string, returning TRUE  each  time  it
               matches,  and FALSE when it eventually runs out of
               matches.  (In other words, it remembers  where  it
               left off last time and restarts the search at that
               point.)  It presumes that you  have  not  modified
               the  string  since  the last match.  Modifying the
               string between matches  may  result  in  undefined
               behavior.   (You  can  actually  get away with in-
               place  modifications  via  substr()  that  do  not
               change  the  length of the entire string.  In gen-
               eral, however, you should be using s///g for  such
               modifications.)  Examples:

                    # array context
                    ($one,$five,$fifteen) = (`uptime` =~ /(\d+\.\d+)/g);

                    # scalar context
                    $/ = ""; $* = 1;
                    while ($paragraph = <>) {
                        while ($paragraph =~ /[a-z]['")]*[.!?]+['")]*\s/g) {
                         $sentences++;
                        }
                    }
                    print "$sentences\n";


       mkdir(FILENAME,MODE)
               Creates  the directory specified by FILENAME, with
               permissions specified  by  MODE  (as  modified  by
               umask).  If it succeeds it returns 1, otherwise it
               returns 0 and sets $! (errno).

       msgctl(ID,CMD,ARG)
               Calls the System V IPC function msgctl.  If CMD is
               &IPC_STAT,  then ARG must be a variable which will
               hold the  returned  msqid_ds  structure.   Returns
               like  ioctl: the undefined value for error, "0 but
               true" for zero, or the actual return value  other-
               wise.

       msgget(KEY,FLAGS)
               Calls  the  System V IPC function msgget.  Returns
               the message queue id, or the  undefined  value  if
               there is an error.

       msgsnd(ID,MSG,FLAGS)
               Calls the System V IPC function msgsnd to send the
               message MSG to the message  queue  ID.   MSG  must
               begin  with  the  long integer message type, which
               may be created  with  pack("L",  $type).   Returns
               true if successful, or false if there is an error.

       msgrcv(ID,VAR,SIZE,TYPE,FLAGS)
               Calls the System V IPC function msgrcv to  receive
               a  message from message queue ID into variable VAR
               with a maximum message size of SIZE.  Note that if
               a  message  is  received, the message type will be
               the first thing in VAR, and the maximum length  of
               VAR  is  SIZE  plus  the size of the message type.
               Returns true if successful, or false if  there  is
               an error.

       next LABEL

       next    The _n_e_x_t command is like the _c_o_n_t_i_n_u_e statement in
               C; it starts the next iteration of the loop:

                    line: while (<STDIN>) {
                         next line if /^#/;  # discard comments
                         ...
                    }

               Note that if there were a _c_o_n_t_i_n_u_e  block  on  the
               above,  it  would  get  executed even on discarded
               lines.  If  the  LABEL  is  omitted,  the  command
               refers to the innermost enclosing loop.

       oct(EXPR)

       oct EXPR
               Returns  the  decimal value of EXPR interpreted as
               an octal string.  (If EXPR happens  to  start  off
               with  0x,  interprets it as a hex string instead.)

               The following will handle decimal, octal  and  hex
               in the standard notation:

                    $val = oct($val) if $val =~ /^0/;

               If EXPR is omitted, uses $_.

       open(FILEHANDLE,EXPR)

       open(FILEHANDLE)

       open FILEHANDLE
               Opens  the  file  whose filename is given by EXPR,
               and associates it with FILEHANDLE.  If  FILEHANDLE
               is an expression, its value is used as the name of
               the real filehandle wanted.  If EXPR  is  omitted,
               the  scalar variable of the same name as the FILE-
               HANDLE contains the  filename.   If  the  filename
               begins with "<" or nothing, the file is opened for
               input.  If the filename begins with ">", the  file
               is opened for output.  If the filename begins with
               ">>", the file is opened for appending.  (You  can
               put  a  '+' in front of the '>' or '<' to indicate
               that you want both read and write  access  to  the
               file.)  If the filename begins with "|", the file-
               name is interpreted as a command to  which  output
               is  to  be  piped, and if the filename ends with a
               "|", the filename is interpreted as command  which
               pipes  input  to  us.  (You may not have a command
               that pipes both in and out.)   Opening  '-'  opens
               _S_T_D_I_N and opening '>-' opens _S_T_D_O_U_T.  Open returns
               non-zero upon success, the undefined value  other-
               wise.   If  the  open  involved a pipe, the return
               value happens to be the  pid  of  the  subprocess.
               Examples:

                    $article = 100;
                    open article || die "Can't find article $article: $!\n";
                    while (<article>) {...

                    open(LOG, '>>/usr/spool/news/twitlog');
                                        # (log is reserved)

                    open(article, "caesar <$article |");
                                        # decrypt article

                    open(extract, "|sort >/tmp/Tmp$$");

               is to be duped and opened.  You may use & after >,

               If you open a pipe on the command "-", i.e. either
               "|-" or "-|", then there is an implicit fork done,
               and  the  return  value  of open is the pid of the
               child within the parent process, and 0 within  the
               child process.  (Use defined($pid) to determine if
               the open was successful.)  The filehandle  behaves
               normally  for the parent, but i/o to that filehan-
               dle is piped from/to the _S_T_D_O_U_T/_S_T_D_I_N of the child
               process.   In  the  child  process  the filehandle
               isn't opened--i/o happens from/to the  new  _S_T_D_O_U_T
               or  _S_T_D_I_N.  Typically this is used like the normal
               piped open when you want to exercise more  control
               over just how the pipe command gets executed, such
               as when you are running setuid, and don't want  to
               have  to  scan  shell commands for metacharacters.
               The following pairs are more or less equivalent:

                    open(FOO, "|tr '[a-z]' '[A-Z]'");
                    open(FOO, "|-") || exec 'tr', '[a-z]', '[A-Z]';

                    open(FOO, "cat -n '$file'|");
                    open(FOO, "-|") || exec 'cat', '-n', $file;

               Explicitly closing any piped filehandle causes the
               parent  process  to  wait for the child to finish,
               and returns the status value in $?.  Note: on  any
               operation  which  may do a fork, unflushed buffers
               remain unflushed in both  processes,  which  means
               you  may need to set $| to avoid duplicate output.

               The filename that is  passed  to  open  will  have

               it,  it's  necessary  to  protect  any leading and

               closedir().  Returns true if successful.   DIRHAN-

       pack(TEMPLATE,LIST)
               Takes an array or list of values and packs it into
               a binary structure, returning the string  contain-
               ing  the structure.  The TEMPLATE is a sequence of
               characters that give the order and type of values,
               as follows:

                    A    An ascii string, will be space padded.
                    a    An ascii string, will be null padded.
                    c    A signed char value.

                    i    A signed integer value.
                    I    An unsigned integer value.
                    l    A signed long value.
                    L    An unsigned long value.

                    b    A bit string (ascending bit order, like vec()).
                    B    A bit string (descending bit order).
                    h    A hex string (low nybble first).
                    H    A hex string (high nybble first).

               Each letter may optionally be followed by a number
               which gives a repeat count.  With all types except
               "a", "A", "b", "B", "h" and "H", the pack function
               will gobble up that many values from the LIST.   A
               *  for  the repeat count means to use however many
               items are left.  The "a" and "A" types gobble just
               one  value,  but  pack  it  as  a string of length
               count, padding with nulls or spaces as  necessary.
               (When  unpacking,  "A"  strips trailing spaces and
               nulls, but "a" does not.)  Likewise, the  "b"  and
               "B" fields pack a string that many bits long.  The
               "h" and "H" fields pack a string that many nybbles
               long.   Real  numbers  (floats and doubles) are in
               the native machine format only; due to the  multi-
               plicity  of  floating formats around, and the lack
               of a standard "network" representation, no  facil-
               ity  for  interchange  has  been made.  This means
               that packed floating point  data  written  on  one
               machine  may  not be readable on another - even if
               both use IEEE floating point  arithmetic  (as  the

               part of the IEEE spec).  Note that perl uses  dou-
               bles  internally  for all numeric calculation, and
               converting from double ->  float  ->  double  will
               lose  precision (i.e. unpack("f", pack("f", $foo))
               will not in general equal $foo).
               Examples:

                    $foo = pack("cccc",65,66,67,68);
                    # foo eq "ABCD"
                    $foo = pack("c4",65,66,67,68);
                    # same thing

                    $foo = pack("ccxxcc",65,66,67,68);
                    # foo eq "AB\0\0CD"

                    $foo = pack("s2",1,2);
                    # "\1\0\2\0" on little-endian
                    # "\0\1\0\2" on big-endian

                    $foo = pack("a4","abcd","x","y","z");
                    # "abcd"

                    $foo = pack("aaaa","abcd","x","y","z");
                    # "axyz"

               The same template may generally also  be  used  in
               the unpack function.

       pipe(READHANDLE,WRITEHANDLE)
               Opens  a  pair  of connected pipes like the corre-
               sponding system call.  Note that if you set  up  a
               loop of piped processes, deadlock can occur unless
               you are very  careful.   In  addition,  note  that
               perl's  pipes use stdio buffering, so you may need
               to set $| to flush  your  WRITEHANDLE  after  each
               command,  depending on the application.  [Requires
               version 3.0 patchlevel 9.]

       pop(ARRAY)

       pop ARRAY
               Pops and returns the  last  value  of  the  array,
               shortening the array by 1.  Has the same effect as

                    $tmp = $ARRAY[$#ARRAY--];

               If there are no elements in the array, returns the
               undefined value.

       print(FILEHANDLE LIST)

       print(LIST)

       print FILEHANDLE LIST

       print LIST

       print   Prints  a  string  or  a  comma-separated  list of
               strings.  Returns non-zero if  successful.   FILE-
               HANDLE  may  be  a  scalar variable name, in which
               case the variable contains the name of  the  file-
               handle, thus introducing one level of indirection.
               (NOTE: If FILEHANDLE is a variable  and  the  next
               token  is  a  term, it may be misinterpreted as an
               operator unless you interpose a +  or  put  parens
               around  the arguments.)  If FILEHANDLE is omitted,
               prints by default to standard output  (or  to  the

               last  selected  output channel--see select()).  If
               LIST is also omitted, prints $_ to _S_T_D_O_U_T.  To set
               the default output channel to something other than
               _S_T_D_O_U_T  use  the  select  operation.   Note  that,
               because  print  takes a LIST, anything in the LIST
               is evaluated in an array context, and any  subrou-
               tine  that  you  call will have one or more of its
               expressions evaluated in an array  context.   Also
               be  careful not to follow the print keyword with a
               left parenthesis unless you want the corresponding
               right  parenthesis  to  terminate the arguments to
               the print--interpose a + or put parens around  all
               the arguments.

       printf(FILEHANDLE LIST)

       printf(LIST)

       printf FILEHANDLE LIST

       printf LIST
               Equivalent  to a "print FILEHANDLE sprintf(LIST)".

       push(ARRAY,LIST)
               Treats ARRAY (@  is  optional)  as  a  stack,  and
               pushes  the  values of LIST onto the end of ARRAY.
               The length of ARRAY increases  by  the  length  of
               LIST.  Has the same effect as

                   for $value (LIST) {
                        $ARRAY[++$#ARRAY] = $value;
                   }

               but is more efficient.

       q/STRING/

       qq/STRING/

       qx/STRING/
               These are not really functions, but simply syntac-
               tic sugar to let you avoid putting too many  back-
               slashes  into quoted strings.  The q operator is a
               generalized single quote, and the  qq  operator  a
               generalized  double  quote.   The qx operator is a
               generalized   backquote.    Any   non-alphanumeric
               delimiter  can  be  used  in place of /, including
               newline.  If the delimiter is an  opening  bracket
               or  parenthesis,  the  final delimiter will be the
               corresponding  closing  bracket  or   parenthesis.

       rand(EXPR)

       rand EXPR

       rand    Returns a random fractional number between  0  and
               the value of EXPR.  (EXPR should be positive.)  If
               EXPR is omitted, returns a value between 0 and  1.
               See also srand().

       read(FILEHANDLE,SCALAR,LENGTH,OFFSET)

       read(FILEHANDLE,SCALAR,LENGTH)
               Attempts  to  read LENGTH bytes of data into vari-
               able  SCALAR  from   the   specified   FILEHANDLE.
               Returns  the  number  of  bytes  actually read, or
               undef if there was an error.  SCALAR will be grown
               or  shrunk to the length actually read.  An OFFSET
               may be specified to place the read  data  at  some
               other  place  than  the  beginning  of the string.
               This call is  actually  implemented  in  terms  of
               stdio's  fread  call.   To  get a true read system
               call, see sysread.

       readdir(DIRHANDLE)

       readdir DIRHANDLE
               Returns the next directory entry for  a  directory
               opened by opendir().  If used in an array context,
               returns all the rest of the entries in the  direc-
               tory.   If  there  are no more entries, returns an
               undefined value in a scalar context or a null list
               in an array context.

       readlink(EXPR)

       readlink EXPR
               Returns  the value of a symbolic link, if symbolic
               links are implemented.   If  not,  gives  a  fatal
               error.  If there is some system error, returns the
               undefined value and sets $! (errno).  If  EXPR  is
               omitted, uses $_.

       recv(SOCKET,SCALAR,LEN,FLAGS)
               Receives  a  message  on  a  socket.   Attempts to
               receive LENGTH bytes of data into variable  SCALAR
               from the specified SOCKET filehandle.  Returns the
               address of the sender, or the undefined  value  if
               there's  an error.  SCALAR will be grown or shrunk
               to the length actually read.  Takes the same flags
               as the system call of the same name.

       redo LABEL

       redo    The  _r_e_d_o  command restarts the loop block without
               evaluating the conditional  again.   The  _c_o_n_t_i_n_u_e
               block,  if  any, is not executed.  If the LABEL is
               omitted,  the  command  refers  to  the  innermost
               enclosing  loop.  This command is normally used by
               programs that want to lie to themselves about what
               was just input:

       rename(OLDNAME,NEWNAME)
               Changes  the  name  of a file.  Returns 1 for suc-
               cess, 0 otherwise.  Will not work across  filesys-
               tem boundaries.

       require EXPR

       require Includes the library file specified by EXPR, or by
               $_ if EXPR is not supplied.  Has semantics similar
               to the following subroutine:

               Note  that  the  file  will  not be included twice
               under the same  specified  name.   The  file  must
               return true as the last statement to indicate suc-
               cessful execution of any initialization  code,  so
               it's customary to end such a file with "1;" unless
               you're sure it'll return true otherwise.

       reset(EXPR)

       reset EXPR

       reset   Generally used in a _c_o_n_t_i_n_u_e block at the end of a
               loop  to  clear variables and reset ?? searches so
               that they work again.  The  expression  is  inter-
               preted  as  a  list  of single characters (hyphens
               allowed for ranges).   All  variables  and  arrays
               beginning  with  one of those letters are reset to
               their pristine state.  If the expression is  omit-
               ted,  one-match  searches (?pattern?) are reset to
               match again.  Only resets variables or searches in
               the current package.  Always returns 1.  Examples:

                   reset 'X';      # reset all X variables
                   reset 'a-z';    # reset lower case variables
                   reset;          # just reset ?? searches

               Note: resetting "A-Z"  is  not  recommended  since
               you'll wipe out your ARGV and ENV arrays.

               The  use  of  reset on dbm associative arrays does
               not change the dbm file.  (It does, however, flush
               any entries cached by perl, which may be useful if

               you are sharing the dbm file.  Then  again,  maybe
               not.)

       return LIST
               Returns  from  a  subroutine with the value speci-
               fied.  (Note that a subroutine  can  automatically
               return the value of the last expression evaluated.
               That's the preferred method--use  of  an  explicit
               _r_e_t_u_r_n is a bit slower.)

       reverse(LIST)

       reverse LIST
               In  an  array context, returns an array value con-
               sisting of the elements of LIST  in  the  opposite
               order.   In  a  scalar  context,  returns a string
               value consisting of the bytes of the first element
               of LIST in the opposite order.

       rewinddir(DIRHANDLE)

       rewinddir DIRHANDLE
               Sets  the current position to the beginning of the
               directory for the readdir() routine on  DIRHANDLE.

       rindex(STR,SUBSTR,POSITION)

       rindex(STR,SUBSTR)
               Works  just  like index except that it returns the
               position of the LAST occurrence of SUBSTR in  STR.
               If  POSITION is specified, returns the last occur-
               rence at or before that position.

       rmdir(FILENAME)

       rmdir FILENAME
               Deletes the directory specified by FILENAME if  it
               is  empty.  If it succeeds it returns 1, otherwise
               it returns 0 and sets $! (errno).  If FILENAME  is
               omitted, uses $_.

       s/PATTERN/REPLACEMENT/gieo
               Searches  a  string  for  a pattern, and if found,
               replaces that pattern with  the  replacement  text
               and  returns  the  number  of  substitutions made.
               Otherwise  it  returns  false  (0).   The  "g"  is
               optional,  and  if  present,  indicates  that  all
               occurrences of the pattern  are  to  be  replaced.
               The  "i"  is  also optional, and if present, indi-
               cates that matching is  to  be  done  in  a  case-
               insensitive manner.  The "e" is likewise optional,

               and if present,  indicates  that  the  replacement
               string  is to be evaluated as an expression rather
               than just as a  double-quoted  string.   Any  non-
               alphanumeric delimiter may replace the slashes; if
               single quotes are used, no interpretation is  done
               on  the  replacement  string (the e modifier over-
               rides this, however); if backquotes are used,  the
               replacement  string  is a command to execute whose
               output will be  used  as  the  actual  replacement
               text.   If  the PATTERN is delimited by bracketing
               quotes,  the  REPLACEMENT  has  its  own  pair  of
               quotes, which may or may not be bracketing quotes,
               e.g.  s(foo)(bar) or s<foo>/bar/.  If no string is
               specified via the =~ or !~ operator, the $_ string
               is searched and modified.  (The  string  specified
               with  =~  must be a scalar variable, an array ele-
               ment, or an assignment to one of  those,  i.e.  an
               lvalue.)   If  the pattern contains a $ that looks
               like a variable rather than an end-of-string test,
               the variable will be interpolated into the pattern
               at run-time.  If you only want  the  pattern  com-
               piled once the first time the variable is interpo-
               lated, add an "o" at  the  end.   If  the  PATTERN
               evaluates  to  a null string, the most recent suc-
               cessful regular expression is used  instead.   See
               also  the  section  on regular expressions.  Exam-
               ples:

                   s/\bgreen\b/mauve/g;      # don't change wintergreen

                   $path =~ s|/usr/bin|/usr/local/bin|;

                   s/Login: $foo/Login: $bar/; # run-time pattern

                   ($foo = $bar) =~ s/bar/foo/;

                   $_ = 'abc123xyz';
                   s/\d+/$&*2/e;        # yields 'abc246xyz'
                   s/\d+/sprintf("%5d",$&)/e;     # yields 'abc  246xyz'
                   s/\w/$& x 2/eg;      # yields 'aabbcc  224466xxyyzz'

                   s/([^ ]*) *([^ ]*)/$2 $1/;     # reverse 1st two fields

               (Note the use of $ instead of \ in the last  exam-
               ple.  See section on regular expressions.)

       scalar(EXPR)
               Forces  EXPR to be interpreted in a scalar context
               and returns the value of EXPR.

       seek(FILEHANDLE,POSITION,WHENCE)
               Randomly positions the file pointer  for  FILEHAN-
               DLE,  just  like the fseek() call of stdio.  FILE-
               HANDLE may be an expression whose value gives  the
               name of the filehandle.  Returns 1 upon success, 0
               otherwise.

       seekdir(DIRHANDLE,POS)
               Sets the current position for the  readdir()  rou-
               tine  on  DIRHANDLE.  POS must be a value returned
               by telldir().  Has the same caveats about possible
               directory  compaction  as the corresponding system
               library routine.

       select(FILEHANDLE)

       select  Returns the currently selected  filehandle.   Sets
               the  current  default  filehandle  for  output, if
               FILEHANDLE is supplied.   This  has  two  effects:
               first,  a  _w_r_i_t_e  or  a _p_r_i_n_t without a filehandle
               will default to this FILEHANDLE.   Second,  refer-
               ences to variables related to output will refer to
               this output channel.  For example, if you have  to
               set  the top of form format for more than one out-
               put channel, you might do the following:

                    select(REPORT1);
                    $^ = 'report1_top';
                    select(REPORT2);
                    $^ = 'report2_top';

               FILEHANDLE may be an expression whose value  gives
               the name of the actual filehandle.  Thus:

                    $oldfh = select(STDERR); $| = 1; select($oldfh);


       select(RBITS,WBITS,EBITS,TIMEOUT)
               This  calls  the  select system call with the bit-
               masks specified, which can  be  constructed  using
               fileno() and vec(), along these lines:

                    $rin = $win = $ein = '';
                    vec($rin,fileno(STDIN),1) = 1;
                    vec($win,fileno(STDOUT),1) = 1;
                    $ein = $rin | $win;

               If  you  want  to  select  on many filehandles you
               might wish to write a subroutine:

                    sub fhbits {

                        local(@fhlist) = split(' ',$_[0]);
                        local($bits);
                        for (@fhlist) {
                         vec($bits,fileno($_),1) = 1;
                        }
                        $bits;
                    }
                    $rin = &fhbits('STDIN TTY SOCK');

               The usual idiom is:

                    ($nfound,$timeleft) =
                      select($rout=$rin, $wout=$win, $eout=$ein, $timeout);

               or to block until something becomes ready:

                    $nfound = select($rout=$rin, $wout=$win,
                                   $eout=$ein, undef);

               Any of the bitmasks can also be undef.  The  time-
               out,  if  specified,  is  in seconds, which may be
               fractional.  NOTE:  not  all  implementations  are
               capable  of returning the $timeleft.  If not, they
               always return  $timeleft  equal  to  the  supplied
               $timeout.

       semctl(ID,SEMNUM,CMD,ARG)
               Calls the System V IPC function semctl.  If CMD is
               &IPC_STAT or &GETALL, then ARG must be a  variable
               which will hold the returned semid_ds structure or
               semaphore value array.  Returns  like  ioctl:  the
               undefined  value for error, "0 but true" for zero,
               or the actual return value otherwise.

       semget(KEY,NSEMS,SIZE,FLAGS)
               Calls the System V IPC function  semget.   Returns
               the  semaphore id, or the undefined value if there
               is an error.

       semop(KEY,OPSTRING)
               Calls the System V IPC function semop  to  perform
               semaphore  operations  such as signaling and wait-
               ing.  OPSTRING must be a  packed  array  of  semop
               structures.  Each semop structure can be generated
               with  'pack("sss",  $semnum,  $semop,  $semflag)'.
               The  number  of semaphore operations is implied by
               the length of OPSTRING.  Returns true if  success-
               ful,  or  false if there is an error.  As an exam-
               ple, the following code waits on semaphore $semnum
               of semaphore id $semid:

                    $semop = pack("sss", $semnum, -1, 0);
                    die "Semaphore trouble: $!\n" unless semop($semid, $semop);

               To signal the semaphore, replace "-1" with "1".

       send(SOCKET,MSG,FLAGS,TO)

       send(SOCKET,MSG,FLAGS)
               Sends a message on a socket.  Takes the same flags
               as the system call of the same  name.   On  uncon-
               nected  sockets  you must specify a destination to
               send TO.  Returns the number of  characters  sent,
               or the undefined value if there is an error.

       setpgrp(PID,PGRP)
               Sets  the  current process group for the specified
               PID, 0 for the current process.   Will  produce  a
               fatal  error  if  used  on  a machine that doesn't
               implement setpgrp(2).

       setpriority(WHICH,WHO,PRIORITY)
               Sets the current priority for a process, a process
               group,  or  a  user.   (See setpriority(2).)  Will
               produce a fatal error if used on  a  machine  that
               doesn't implement setpriority(2).

       setsockopt(SOCKET,LEVEL,OPTNAME,OPTVAL)
               Sets  the  socket option requested.  Returns unde-
               fined if there is an error.  OPTVAL may be  speci-
               fied  as  undef if you don't want to pass an argu-
               ment.

       shift(ARRAY)

       shift ARRAY

       shift   Shifts the  first  value  of  the  array  off  and
               returns  it,  shortening the array by 1 and moving
               everything down.  If there are no elements in  the
               array,  returns  the undefined value.  If ARRAY is
               omitted, shifts the @ARGV array in the  main  pro-
               gram,  and  the @_ array in subroutines.  (This is
               determined lexically.)  See also unshift(), push()
               and  pop().   Shift()  and  unshift()  do the same
               thing to the left end of an array that push()  and
               pop() do to the right end.

       shmctl(ID,CMD,ARG)
               Calls the System V IPC function shmctl.  If CMD is
               &IPC_STAT, then ARG must be a variable which  will
               hold  the  returned  shmid_ds  structure.  Returns

               like ioctl: the undefined value for error, "0  but
               true"  for zero, or the actual return value other-
               wise.

       shmget(KEY,SIZE,FLAGS)
               Calls the System V IPC function  shmget.   Returns
               the  shared  memory  segment  id, or the undefined
               value if there is an error.

       shmread(ID,VAR,POS,SIZE)

       shmwrite(ID,STRING,POS,SIZE)
               Reads or writes the System V shared memory segment
               ID  starting  at  position  POS  for  size SIZE by
               attaching to it,  copying  in/out,  and  detaching
               from  it.   When  reading,  VAR must be a variable
               which will hold the data read.  When  writing,  if
               STRING  is  too long, only SIZE bytes are used; if
               STRING is too short, nulls are written to fill out
               SIZE  bytes.   Return true if successful, or false
               if there is an error.

       shutdown(SOCKET,HOW)
               Shuts down a socket connection in the manner indi-
               cated by HOW, which has the same interpretation as
               in the system call of the same name.

       sin(EXPR)

       sin EXPR
               Returns the sine of EXPR (expressed  in  radians).
               If EXPR is omitted, returns sine of $_.

       sleep(EXPR)

       sleep EXPR

       sleep   Causes  the  script  to sleep for EXPR seconds, or
               forever if no EXPR.  May be interrupted by sending
               the process a SIGALRM.  Returns the number of sec-
               onds actually  slept.   You  probably  cannot  mix
               alarm()  and sleep() calls, since sleep() is often
               implemented using alarm().

       socket(SOCKET,DOMAIN,TYPE,PROTOCOL)
               Opens a socket of the specified kind and  attaches
               it  to filehandle SOCKET.  DOMAIN, TYPE and PROTO-
               COL are specified the same as for the system  call
               of  the  same  name.   You may need to run h2ph on
               sys/socket.h to get the proper values handy  in  a
               perl  library  file.   Return  true if successful.

               See the example in  the  section  on  Interprocess
               Communication.

       socketpair(SOCKET1,SOCKET2,DOMAIN,TYPE,PROTOCOL)
               Creates  an  unnamed pair of sockets in the speci-
               fied domain, of the specified type.  DOMAIN,  TYPE
               and  PROTOCOL  are  specified  the same as for the
               system call of the same name.   If  unimplemented,
               yields  a fatal error.  Return true if successful.

       sort(SUBROUTINE LIST)

       sort(LIST)

       sort SUBROUTINE LIST

       sort BLOCK LIST

       sort LIST
               Sorts the LIST and returns the sorted array value.
               Nonexistent values of arrays are stripped out.  If
               SUBROUTINE or BLOCK is omitted, sorts in  standard
               string  comparison order.  If SUBROUTINE is speci-
               fied, gives the name of a subroutine that  returns
               an integer less than, equal to, or greater than 0,
               depending on how the elements of the array are  to
               be  ordered.   (The  <=>  and  cmp  operators  are
               extremely useful in  such  routines.)   SUBROUTINE
               may  be  a scalar variable name, in which case the
               value provides the name of the subroutine to  use.
               In  place  of a SUBROUTINE name, you can provide a
               BLOCK as an anonymous, in-line sort subroutine.

               In the interests of efficiency the normal  calling
               code for subroutines is bypassed, with the follow-
               ing effects: the subroutine may not be a recursive
               subroutine,  and  the  two elements to be compared
               are passed into the subroutine not via @_  but  as
               $a and $b (see example below).  They are passed by
               reference so don't modify $a and $b.

               Examples:

                    # sort lexically
                    @articles = sort @files;

                    # same thing, but with explicit sort routine
                    @articles = sort {$a cmp $b} @files;

                    # same thing in reversed order
                    @articles = sort {$b cmp $a} @files;

       splice(ARRAY,OFFSET,LENGTH,LIST)

       splice(ARRAY,OFFSET,LENGTH)

       splice(ARRAY,OFFSET)
               Removes the  elements  designated  by  OFFSET  and
               LENGTH  from  an array, and replaces them with the
               elements of LIST, if any.   Returns  the  elements
               removed  from  the  array.   The  array  grows  or
               shrinks  as  necessary.   If  LENGTH  is  omitted,
               removes  everything  from OFFSET onward.  The fol-
               lowing equivalencies hold (assuming $[ == 0):

                    unshift(@a,$x,$y)             splice(@a,0,0,$x,$y)
                    $a[$x] = $y                   splice(@a,$x,1,$y);

               Example, assuming array lengths are passed before arrays:

                    sub aeq { # compare two array values
                         local(@a) = splice(@_,0,shift);
                         local(@b) = splice(@_,0,shift);
                         return 0 unless @a == @b;     # same len?
                         while (@a) {
                             return 0 if pop(@a) ne pop(@b);
                         }

       split(/PATTERN/,EXPR,LIMIT)

       split(/PATTERN/,EXPR)

       split(/PATTERN/)

       split   Splits a string into  an  array  of  strings,  and
               returns  it.  (If not in an array context, returns
               the number of fields found and splits into the  @_
               array.   (In  an  array context, you can force the
               split into @_ by using ?? as  the  pattern  delim-
               iters, but it still returns the array value.))  If
               EXPR is omitted, splits the $_ string.  If PATTERN
               is    also    omitted,    splits   on   whitespace
               (/[ \t\n]+/).  Anything matching PATTERN is  taken
               to  be  a  delimiter separating the fields.  (Note
               that the delimiter may be longer than one  charac-
               ter.)   If LIMIT is specified, splits into no more
               than that many fields (though it  may  split  into
               fewer).   If  LIMIT  is unspecified, trailing null
               fields are  stripped  (which  potential  users  of
               pop()  would  do  well  to  remember).   A pattern
               matching the null string (not to be confused  with
               a null pattern //, which is just one member of the
               set of patterns matching a null string) will split
               the value of EXPR into separate characters at each
               point it matches that way.  For example:

                    print join(':', split(/ */, 'hi there'));

               produces the output 'h:i:t:h:e:r:e'.

               The LIMIT parameter can be used to partially split
               a line

                    ($login, $passwd, $remainder) = split(/:/, $_, 3);

               (When  assigning  to  a list, if LIMIT is omitted,
               perl supplies a LIMIT one larger than  the  number
               of  variables  in  the  list, to avoid unnecessary
               work.  For the list above LIMIT would have been  4
               by  default.   In  time  critical  applications it
               behooves you not to split into  more  fields  than
               you really need.)

               If  the  PATTERN  contains parentheses, additional

               array elements are created from each matching sub-
               string in the delimiter.

                    split(/([,-])/,"1-10,20");

               produces the array value

                    (1,'-',10,',',20)

               The  pattern  /PATTERN/  may  be  replaced with an
               expression to specify patterns that vary  at  run-
               time.   (To  do runtime compilation only once, use
               /$variable/o.)  As a special  case,  specifying  a
               space  (' ')  will  split  on  white space just as
               split with no arguments does,  but  leading  white
               space  does NOT produce a null first field.  Thus,
               split(' ') can be used to  emulate  _a_w_k's  default
               behavior, whereas split(/ /) will give you as many
               null initial fields as there are leading spaces.

               Example:

                    open(passwd, '/etc/passwd');
                    while (<passwd>) {
                         ($login, $passwd, $uid, $gid, $gcos, $home, $shell)
                              = split(/:/);
                         ...
                    }

               (Note that $shell above will still have a  newline
               on it.  See chop().)  See also _j_o_i_n.

       sprintf(FORMAT,LIST)
               Returns  a  string  formatted  by the usual printf
               conventions.  The * character is not supported.

       sqrt(EXPR)

       sqrt EXPR
               Return the square root of EXPR.  If EXPR is  omit-
               ted, returns square root of $_.

       srand(EXPR)

       srand EXPR
               Sets the random number seed for the _r_a_n_d operator.
               If EXPR is omitted, does srand(time).

       stat(FILEHANDLE)

       stat FILEHANDLE

       stat(EXPR)

       stat SCALARVARIABLE
               Returns a 13-element array giving  the  statistics
               for a file, either the file opened via FILEHANDLE,
               or named by EXPR.  Returns a null list if the stat
               fails.  Typically used as follows:

                   ($dev,$ino,$mode,$nlink,$uid,$gid,$rdev,$size,
                      $atime,$mtime,$ctime,$blksize,$blocks)
                          = stat($filename);

               If  stat is passed the special filehandle consist-
               ing of an underline, no stat is done, but the cur-
               rent  contents of the stat structure from the last
               stat or filetest are returned.  Example:

                    if (-x $file && (($d) = stat(_)) && $d < 0) {
                         print "$file is executable NFS file\n";
                    }

               (This only works on machines for which the  device
               number is negative under NFS.)

       study(SCALAR)

       study SCALAR

       study   Takes  extra  time to study SCALAR ($_ if unspeci-
               fied)  in  anticipation  of  doing  many   pattern
               matches  on the string before it is next modified.
               This may or may not save time,  depending  on  the
               nature  and  number  of patterns you are searching
               on, and on the distribution of character  frequen-
               cies  in  the  string to be searched--you probably
               want to compare runtimes with and  without  it  to
               see which runs faster.  Those loops which scan for
               many short constant strings  (including  the  con-
               stant parts of more complex patterns) will benefit
               most.  You may have only one  study  active  at  a
               time--if you study a different scalar the first is
               "unstudied".  (The way  study  works  is  this:  a
               linked list of every character in the string to be
               searched is made, so we know, for  example,  where
               all  the  'k'  characters  are.   From each search
               string, the rarest character is selected, based on

               C programs and English text.   Only  those  places
               that  contain  this  "rarest"  character are exam-
               ined.)

               For example, here is a loop  which  inserts  index
               producing  entries  before  any  line containing a
               certain pattern:

                    while (<>) {
                         study;
                         print ".IX foo\n" if /\bfoo\b/;
                         print ".IX bar\n" if /\bbar\b/;
                         print ".IX blurfl\n" if /\bblurfl\b/;
                         ...
                         print;
                    }

               In searching for /\bfoo\b/, only  those  locations
               in  $_ that contain 'f' will be looked at, because
               'f' is rarer than 'o'.  In general, this is a  big
               win  except in pathological cases.  The only ques-
               tion is whether it saves you  more  time  than  it
               took  to build the linked list in the first place.

               Note that if you have to look for strings that you
               don't  know  till runtime, you can build an entire
               loop as a string and eval that to avoid  recompil-
               ing all your patterns all the time.  Together with
               undefining $/ to input entire files as one record,
               this  can be very fast, often faster than special-
               ized programs like fgrep.  The following  scans  a
               list  of  files  (@files)  for  a  list  of  words
               (@words), and prints out the names of those  files
               that contain a match:

                    $search = 'while (<>) { study;';
                    foreach $word (@words) {
                        $search .= "++\$seen{\$ARGV} if /\\b$word\\b/;\n";
                    }
                    $search .= "}";
                    @ARGV = @files;
                    undef $/;
                    eval $search;       # this screams
                    $/ = "\n";          # put back to normal input delim
                    foreach $file (sort keys(%seen)) {
                        print $file, "\n";

       substr(EXPR,OFFSET)
               Extracts  a  substring out of EXPR and returns it.
               First character is at offset 0, or whatever you've
               set $[ to.  If OFFSET is negative, starts that far
               from the end of the string.  If  LEN  is  omitted,
               returns  everything to the end of the string.  You
               can use the substr() function  as  an  lvalue,  in
               which  case EXPR must be an lvalue.  If you assign
               something  shorter  than  LEN,  the  string   will
               shrink,  and  if  you assign something longer than
               LEN, the string will grow to accommodate  it.   To
               keep  the  string  the same length you may need to
               pad or chop your value using sprintf().

       symlink(OLDFILE,NEWFILE)
               Creates a new filename symbolically linked to  the
               old filename.  Returns 1 for success, 0 otherwise.
               On systems that don't support symbolic links, pro-
               duces  a  fatal  error  at run time.  To check for
               that, use eval:

       syscall(LIST)

       syscall LIST
               Calls the system call specified as the first  ele-
               ment  of  the list, passing the remaining elements
               as arguments to  the  system  call.   If  unimple-
               mented, produces a fatal error.  The arguments are
               interpreted as follows: if  a  given  argument  is
               numeric,  the  argument  is  passed as an int.  If
               not, the pointer to the string  value  is  passed.
               You  are responsible to make sure a string is pre-
               extended long enough to receive  any  result  that
               might  be  written into a string.  If your integer
               arguments are not literals  and  have  never  been
               interpreted  in a numeric context, you may need to
               add 0 to them to force them to look like  numbers.

               mixing this with other kinds of  reads  may  cause
               confusion.   Returns  the number of bytes actually
               read, or undef if there was an error.  SCALAR will
               be  grown  or  shrunk to the length actually read.
               An OFFSET may be specified to place the read  data
               at  some  other  place  than  the beginning of the

       system LIST
               Does exactly the same thing as "exec LIST"  except
               that  a fork is done first, and the parent process
               waits for the child  process  to  complete.   Note
               that  argument  processing varies depending on the
               number of arguments.  The return value is the exit
               status  of  the  program as returned by the wait()
               call.  To get the actual exit value divide by 256.

               able SCALAR to the specified FILEHANDLE, using the

               ing this with prints may cause confusion.  Returns
               the  number of bytes actually written, or undef if
               there was an error.  An OFFSET may be specified to
               place  the  read data at some other place than the

       tell(FILEHANDLE)

       tell FILEHANDLE

       tell    Returns the current file position for  FILEHANDLE.
               FILEHANDLE  may be an expression whose value gives
               the name of the actual filehandle.  If  FILEHANDLE
               is omitted, assumes the file last read.

       telldir(DIRHANDLE)

       telldir DIRHANDLE
               Returns the current position of the readdir() rou-

               seekdir()  to  access  a  particular location in a

               synonym for _t_r.  If the SEARCHLIST is delimited by
               bracketing quotes, the REPLACEMENTLIST has its own
               pair of quotes, which may or may not be bracketing
               quotes, e.g.  tr[A-Z][a-z] or tr(+-*/)/ABCD/.

               If the c modifier  is  specified,  the  SEARCHLIST
               character  set is complemented.  If the d modifier
               is specified, any characters specified by  SEARCH-
               LIST  that  are  not  found in REPLACEMENTLIST are
               deleted.  (Note that this is slightly more  flexi-
               ble  than  the behavior of some _t_r programs, which
               delete  anything  they  find  in  the  SEARCHLIST,
               period.)    If   the   s  modifier  is  specified,
               sequences of characters that  were  translated  to
               the same character are squashed down to 1 instance
               of the character.

               If the d modifier was used, the REPLACEMENTLIST is
               always  interpreted  exactly as specified.  Other-
               wise, if the REPLACEMENTLIST is shorter  than  the
               SEARCHLIST, the final character is replicated till
               it is long  enough.   If  the  REPLACEMENTLIST  is
               null,  the  SEARCHLIST is replicated.  This latter
               is useful for counting characters in a  class,  or
               for squashing character sequences in a class.

       truncate(EXPR,LENGTH)
               Truncates  the file opened on FILEHANDLE, or named
               by EXPR, to  the  specified  length.   Produces  a
               fatal  error if truncate isn't implemented on your
               system.

       umask(EXPR)

       umask EXPR

       umask   Sets the umask for the process and returns the old
               one.   If  EXPR is omitted, merely returns current
               umask.

       undef(EXPR)

       undef EXPR

       undef   Undefines the value of  EXPR,  which  must  be  an
               lvalue.   Use  only  on  a scalar value, an entire
               array, or a subroutine  name  (using  &).   (Undef
               will  probably not do what you expect on most pre-
               defined variables or dbm  array  values.)   Always
               returns  the  undefined  value.   You can omit the
               EXPR, in which case nothing is undefined, but  you
               still  get  an undefined value that you could, for
               instance, return from a subroutine.  Examples:

       unlink(LIST)

       unlink LIST
               Deletes a list of files.  Returns  the  number  of
               files successfully deleted.

                    $cnt = unlink 'a', 'b', 'c';
                    unlink @goners;
                    unlink <*.bak>;

               Note:  unlink  will  not delete directories unless
               you are superuser and the --UU flag is  supplied  to
               _p_e_r_l.  Even if these conditions are met, be warned
               that unlinking a directory can inflict  damage  on
               your filesystem.  Use rmdir instead.

       unpack(TEMPLATE,EXPR)
               Unpack does the reverse of pack: it takes a string
               representing a structure and expands it  out  into
               an  array value, returning the array value.  (In a
               scalar context, it merely returns the first  value
               produced.)  The TEMPLATE has the same format as in
               the pack function.  Here's a subroutine that  does
               substring:

                    sub substr {
                         local($what,$where,$howmuch) = @_;
                         unpack("x$where a$howmuch", $what);
                    }

               and then there's

                    sub ord { unpack("c",$_[0]); }

               In  addition, you may prefix a field with a %<num-
               ber> to indicate  that  you  want  a  <number>-bit
               checksum  of  the items instead of the items them-
               selves.  Default is a 16-bit checksum.  For  exam-
               ple, the following computes the same number as the
               System V sum program:

                    while (<>) {
                        $checksum += unpack("%16C*", $_);
                    }
                    $checksum %= 65536;


       unshift(ARRAY,LIST)
               Does the opposite of a _s_h_i_f_t.  Or the opposite  of
               a _p_u_s_h, depending on how you look at it.  Prepends
               list to the front of the array,  and  returns  the

       utime(LIST)

       utime LIST
               Changes  the access and modification times on each
               file of a list of files.  The first  two  elements
               of the list must be the NUMERICAL access and modi-
               fication times, in that order.  Returns the number
               of  files successfully changed.  The inode modifi-
               cation time of each file is  set  to  the  current
               time.  Example of a "touch" command:

                    #!/usr/bin/perl
                    $now = time;
                    utime $now, $now, @ARGV;


       values(ASSOC_ARRAY)

       values ASSOC_ARRAY
               Returns  a normal array consisting of all the val-
               ues of the named associative  array.   The  values
               are returned in an apparently random order, but it
               is the same order as either the keys()  or  each()
               function  would  produce  on  the same array.  See
               also keys() and each().

       vec(EXPR,OFFSET,BITS)
               Treats a string as a vector of unsigned  integers,
               and  returns  the value of the bitfield specified.
               May also be assigned to.  BITS must be a power  of
               two from 1 to 32.

               Vectors created with vec() can also be manipulated
               with the logical operators |, & and ^, which  will
               assume a bit vector operation is desired when both
               operands are strings.  This interpretation is  not
               enabled unless there is at least one vec() in your
               program, to protect older programs.

               To transform a bit vector into a string  or  array
               of 0's and 1's, use these:

                    $bits = unpack("b*", $vector);
                    @bits = split(//, unpack("b*", $vector));

               If  you  know  the exact length in bits, it can be

               $?.

       waitpid(PID,FLAGS)
               Waits  for a particular child process to terminate
               and returns the pid of the deceased process, or -1
               if  there is no such child process.  The status is
               returned in $?.  If you say

                    ...
                    waitpid(-1,&WNOHANG);

               then you can do a non-blocking wait for  any  pro-
               cess.   Non-blocking  wait  is  only  available on
               machines supporting  either  the  _w_a_i_t_p_i_d  _(_2_)  or
               _w_a_i_t_4  _(_2_)  system  calls.  However, waiting for a
               particular pid with  FLAGS  of  0  is  implemented
               everywhere.   (Perl  emulates  the  system call by
               remembering the status values  of  processes  that
               have  exited  but  have  not been harvested by the
               Perl script yet.)

       wantarray

               Returns false if the  context  is  looking  for  a

                    return wantarray ? () : undef;


       warn(LIST)

               Produces  a message on STDERR just like "die", but

       write(EXPR)

       write   Writes a formatted record (possibly multi-line) to
               the  specified  file,  using the format associated
               with that file.  By default the format for a  file
               is the one having the same name is the filehandle,
               but the format for the current output channel (see

               _s_e_l_e_c_t)  may  be  set  explicitly by assigning the
               name of the format to the $~ variable.

               Top of form processing is  handled  automatically:
               if  there is insufficient room on the current page
               for the formatted record, the page is advanced  by
               writing  a form feed, a special top-of-page format
               is used to format the new page  header,  and  then
               the record is written.  By default the top-of-page
               format is the name of the filehandle  with  "_TOP"
               appended,  but  it  may be dynamicallly set to the
               format of your choice by assigning the name to the
               $^ variable while the filehandle is selected.  The
               number of lines remaining on the current  page  is
               in  variable  $-, which can be set to 0 to force a
               new page.

               If FILEHANDLE is unspecified, output goes  to  the
               current  default  output channel, which starts out
               as _S_T_D_O_U_T but may be changed by the _s_e_l_e_c_t  opera-
               tor.   If  the  FILEHANDLE  is  an  EXPR, then the
               expression is evaluated and the  resulting  string
               is  used  to look up the name of the FILEHANDLE at
               run time.  For more on formats, see the section on
               formats later on.

               Note that write is NOT the opposite of read.

       right     ! ~ and unary minus
       right     **
       nonassoc  ++ --
       left      '('

       As mentioned earlier, if any list operator  (print,  etc.)
       or any unary operator (chdir, etc.)  is followed by a left
       parenthesis as the next token on the same line, the opera-
       tor  and  arguments  within parentheses are taken to be of
       highest precedence, just  like  a  normal  function  call.
       Examples:

            chdir $foo || die;       # (chdir $foo) || die
            chdir($foo) || die;      # (chdir $foo) || die
            chdir ($foo) || die;     # (chdir $foo) || die
            chdir +($foo) || die;    # (chdir $foo) || die

       but, because * is higher precedence than ||:

            chdir $foo * 20;         # chdir ($foo * 20)
            chdir($foo) * 20;        # (chdir $foo) * 20
            chdir ($foo) * 20;       # (chdir $foo) * 20
            chdir +($foo) * 20;      # chdir ($foo * 20)

            rand 10 * 20;            # rand (10 * 20)
            rand(10) * 20;           # (rand 10) * 20
            rand (10) * 20;          # (rand 10) * 20
            rand +(10) * 20;         # rand (10 * 20)

       In  the  absence  of  parentheses,  the precedence of list
       operators such as print, sort or chmod is either very high
       or very low depending on whether you look at the left side
       of operator or the right side of it.  For example, in

            @ary = (1, 3, sort 4, 2);
            print @ary;         # prints 1324

       the commas on the right of the sort are  evaluated  before
       the  sort, but the commas on the left are evaluated after.
       In other words, list operators tend to gobble up  all  the
       arguments  that  follow  them,  and then act like a simple
       term with regard to the preceding expression.   Note  that
       you have to be careful with parens:

            # These evaluate exit before doing the print:
            print($foo, exit);  # Obviously not what you want.
            print $foo, exit;   # Nor is this.

       SSuubbrroouuttiinneess

       A subroutine may be declared as follows:

           sub NAME BLOCK


       Any  arguments  passed to the routine come in as array @_,
       that is ($_[0], $_[1], ...).  The  array  @_  is  a  local
       array,  but its values are references to the actual scalar
       parameters.  The return value of  the  subroutine  is  the
       value  of the last expression evaluated, and can be either
       an array value or a scalar value.  Alternately,  a  return
       statement  may  be  used to specify the returned value and
       exit the subroutine.  To create local  variables  see  the
       _l_o_c_a_l operator.

       A  subroutine  is  called  using  the _d_o operator or the &
       operator.

       Example:

            sub MAX {

       Example:

            #  that start with whitespace
            sub get_line {
                 $thisline = $lookahead;
                 line: while ($lookahead = <STDIN>) {

            $lookahead = <STDIN>;    # get first line

       Use array assignment to a local list to name your formal arguments:

            sub maybeset {
                 local($key, $value) = @_;
                 $foo{$key} = $value unless $foo{$key};
            }

       This also has the effect of turning call-by-reference into
       call-by-value, since the assignment copies the values.

       Subroutines may be called recursively.  If a subroutine is
       called using the & form, the argument  list  is  optional.
       If  omitted, no @_ array is set up for the subroutine; the
       @_ array at the time of the call is visible to  subroutine
       instead.

            do foo(1,2,3);      # pass three arguments
            &foo(1,2,3);        # the same

            do foo();      # pass a null list
            &foo();             # the same
            &foo;               # pass no arguments--more efficient

       Sometimes  you don't want to pass the value of an array to
       a subroutine but rather the name of it, so that  the  sub-
       routine  can  modify  the  global  copy  of it rather than

       working with a local copy.  In perl you can refer  to  all
       the  objects  of  a  particular name by prefixing the name
       with a star: *foo.  When evaluated, it produces  a  scalar
       value  that  represents  all  the  objects  of  that name,
       including any  filehandle,  format  or  subroutine.   When
       assigned to within a local() operation, it causes the name
       mentioned to refer to whatever * value was assigned to it.
       Example:

            sub doubleary {
                local(*someary) = @_;
                foreach $elem (@someary) {
                 $elem *= 2;
                }
            }
            do doubleary(*foo);
            do doubleary(*bar);

       Assignment to *name is currently recommended only inside a
       local().  You can actually assign to *name  anywhere,  but
       the  previous  referent  of *name may be stranded forever.
       This may or may not bother you.

       Note that scalars are already passed by reference, so  you
       can  modify  scalar arguments without using this mechanism
       by referring explicitly to the $_[nnn] in  question.   You
       can modify all the elements of an array by passing all the
       elements as scalars, but you have to use the  *  mechanism
       to push, pop or change the size of an array.  The * mecha-
       nism will probably be more efficient in any case.

       Since a *name value contains unprintable binary  data,  if
       it  is used as an argument in a print, or as a %s argument
       in a printf or sprintf, it then  has  the  value  '*name',
       just so it prints out pretty.

       Even  if you don't want to modify an array, this mechanism
       is useful for passing multiple arrays in  a  single  LIST,
       since normally the LIST mechanism will merge all the array
       values so  that  you  can't  extract  out  the  individual
       arrays.

       The  patterns used in pattern matching are regular expres-
       sions such as those supplied in the Version 8 regexp  rou-
       tines.   (In  fact,  the  routines  are derived from Henry
       Spencer's freely redistributable reimplementation  of  the
       V8  routines.)   In  addition,  \w matches an alphanumeric
       character (including "_") and \W a nonalphanumeric.   Word
       boundaries may be matched by \b, and non-boundaries by \B.

PERL(1)                BSD Reference Manual               PERL(1)


       A whitespace character is matched by \s, non-whitespace by
       \S.   A numeric character is matched by \d, non-numeric by
       \D.  You may use \w, \s and \d within  character  classes.
       Also,  \n, \r, \f, \t and \NNN have their normal interpre-
       tations.  Within character classes \b represents backspace
       rather  than  a  word boundary.  Alternatives may be sepa-
       rated by |.  The bracketing construct ( ... ) may also  be
       used,  in  which  case  \<digit> matches the digit'th sub-
       string.  (Outside of the pattern, always use $ instead  of
       \  in  front of the digit.  The scope of $<digit> (and $`,
       $& and $') extends to the end of the  enclosing  BLOCK  or
       eval  string, or to the next pattern match with subexpres-
       sions.  The \<digit> notation sometimes works outside  the
       current  pattern, but should not be relied upon.)  You may
       have as many parentheses as you wish.  If  you  have  more
       than  9  substrings,  the variables $10, $11, ... refer to
       the corresponding substring.   Within  the  pattern,  \10,
       \11,  etc.  refer back to substrings if there have been at
       least that many  left  parens  before  the  backreference.
       Otherwise  (for  backward compatibilty) \10 is the same as
       \010, a backspace, and \11 the same as \011, a  tab.   And
       so on.  (\1 through \9 are always backreferences.)

       $+  returns  whatever  the last bracket match matched.  $&
       returns the entire matched string.  ($0 used to return the
       same  thing,  but  not  any  more.)  $` returns everything
       before the matched string.  $'  returns  everything  after
       the matched string.  Examples:

            s/^([^ ]*) *([^ ]*)/$2 $1/;   # swap first two words

            if (/Time: (..):(..):(..)/) {
                 $hours = $1;
                 $minutes = $2;
                 $seconds = $3;
            }

       By default, the ^ character is only guaranteed to match at
       the beginning of the string, the $ character only  at  the
       end  (or before the newline at the end) and _p_e_r_l does cer-
       tain optimizations with the  assumption  that  the  string
       contains only one line.  The behavior of ^ and $ on embed-
       ded newlines will be inconsistent.  You may, however, wish
       to  treat a string as a multi-line buffer, such that the ^
       will match after any newline within the string, and $ will
       match  before  any  newline.  At the cost of a little more
       overhead, you can do this by setting the variable $* to 1.
       Setting  it  back to 0 makes _p_e_r_l revert to its old behav-
       ior.

       never  matches a newline (even when $* is 0).  In particu-
       lar, the following leaves a newline on the $_ string:

            $_ = <STDIN>;
            s/.*(some_string).*/$1/;

       If the newline is unwanted, try one of

            s/.*(some_string).*\n/$1/;
            s/.*(some_string)[^\000]*/$1/;
            s/.*(some_string)(.|\n)*/$1/;
            chop; s/.*(some_string).*/$1/;
            /(some_string)/ && ($_ = $1);

       Any item of a regular expression may be followed with dig-
       its in curly brackets of the form {n,m}, where n gives the
       minimum number of times to match the item and m gives  the
       maximum.   The form {n} is equivalent to {n,n} and matches
       exactly n times.  The form {n,} matches n or  more  times.
       (If  a  curly  bracket  occurs in any other context, it is
       treated as a regular character.)  The * modifier is equiv-
       alent  to  {0,}, the + modifier to {1,} and the ? modifier
       to {0,1}.  There is no limit to the size of n  or  m,  but
       large numbers will chew up more memory.

       You  will note that all backslashed metacharacters in _p_e_r_l
       are alphanumeric, such as \b, \w, \n.  Unlike  some  other
       regular  expression  languages,  there  are no backslashed
       symbols that aren't alphanumeric.  So anything that  looks
       like  \\,  \(, \), \<, \>, \{, or \} is always interpreted
       as a literal character, not a metacharacter.   This  makes
       it  simple  to  quote  a string that you want to use for a
       pattern but that you are afraid might contain  metacharac-
       ters.  Simply quote all the non-alphanumeric characters:

            $pattern =~ s/(\W)/\\$1/g;

       1.  A comment.

       2.  A "picture" line giving  the  format  for  one  output
           line.

       3.  An  argument line supplying values to plug into a pic-
           ture line.

       Picture lines are printed exactly as they look, except for
       certain fields that substitute values into the line.  Each
       picture field starts with either @ or ^.  The @ field (not
       to  be  confused  with  the  array marker @) is the normal
       case; ^ fields are used to do rudimentary multi-line  text
       block  filling.   The  length  of the field is supplied by
       padding out the field with multiple <, >, or |  characters
       to specify, respectively, left justification, right justi-
       fication, or centering.  As an  alternate  form  of  right
       justification,  you  may  also  use  # characters (with an
       optional .) to specify a numeric field.  (Use of ^ instead
       of @ causes the field to be blanked if undefined.)  If any
       of the values supplied for these fields  contains  a  new-
       line,  only  the  text  up to the newline is printed.  The
       special field @* can be used for printing multi-line  val-
       ues.  It should appear by itself on a line.

       The  values  are  specified  on the following line, in the
       same order as the picture fields.  The  values  should  be
       separated by commas.

       Picture fields that begin with ^ rather than @ are treated
       specially.  The value supplied must be a  scalar  variable
       name which contains a text string.  _P_e_r_l puts as much text
       as it can into the field, and then chops off the front  of
       the  string  so  that the next time the variable is refer-
       enced, more of the text  can  be  printed.   Normally  you
       would  use  a  sequence  of  fields in a vertical stack to
       print out a block of text.  If you like, you can  end  the
       final  field  with ..., which will appear in the output if
       the text was too long to appear in its entirety.  You  can
       change  which characters are legal to break on by changing
       the variable $: to a list of the desired characters.

       Since use of ^ fields can produce variable length  records
       if  the  text  to  be formatted is short, you can suppress
       blank lines by putting the tilde (~) character anywhere in
       the  line.   (Normally  you  should put it in the front if
       possible, for visibility.)  The tilde will  be  translated
       to  a  space  upon output.  If you put a second tilde con-
       tiguous to the first, the line will be repeated until  all
       the fields on the line are exhausted.  (If you use a field
       of the @ variety, the expression you supply had better not

       It  is possible to intermix prints with writes on the same
       output channel, but you'll have to handle $-  (lines  left
       on the page) yourself.

       If you are printing lots of fields that are usually blank,
       you should  consider  using  the  reset  operator  between

       The  IPC  facilities  of  perl  are  built on the Berkeley
       socket mechanism.  If you  don't  have  sockets,  you  can
       ignore this section.  The calls have the same names as the
       corresponding system calls, but the arguments tend to dif-
       fer,  for two reasons.  First, perl file handles work dif-
       ferently than C file descriptors.   Second,  perl  already
       knows the length of its strings, so you don't need to pass
       that information.  Here is a sample client (untested):

            ($them,$port) = @ARGV;
            $port = 2345 unless $port;
            $them = 'localhost' unless $them;

            $SIG{'INT'} = 'dokill';
            sub dokill { kill 9,$child if $child; }

            require 'sys/socket.ph';

            $sockaddr = 'S n a4 x8';
            chop($hostname = `hostname`);

            ($name, $aliases, $proto) = getprotobyname('tcp');
            ($name, $aliases, $port) = getservbyname($port, 'tcp')
                 unless $port =~ /^\d+$/;
            ($name, $aliases, $type, $len, $thisaddr) =
                                gethostbyname($hostname);
            ($name, $aliases, $type, $len, $thataddr) = gethostbyname($them);

            $this = pack($sockaddr, &AF_INET, 0, $thisaddr);
            $that = pack($sockaddr, &AF_INET, $port, $thataddr);

            socket(S, &PF_INET, &SOCK_STREAM, $proto) || die "socket: $!";
            bind(S, $this) || die "bind: $!";
            connect(S, $that) || die "connect: $!";

            select(S); $| = 1; select(stdout);

            if ($child = fork) {
                 while (<>) {
                      print S;
                 }
                 sleep 3;
                 do dokill();

       reasonable mnemonics, or analogues in one of the shells.

       $_      The  default  input  and  pattern-searching space.
               The following pairs are equivalent:

                    while (<>) {...     # only equivalent in while!
                    while ($_ = <>) {...

                    /^Subject:/
                    $_ =~ /^Subject:/

                    y/a-z/A-Z/
                    $_ =~ y/a-z/A-Z/

                    chop
                    chop($_)

               (Mnemonic:  underline  is  understood  in  certain
               operations.)

       $.      The current input line number of the last filehan-
               dle that was read.  Readonly.  Remember that  only
               an  explicit  close  on  the filehandle resets the
               line number.  Since  <>  never  does  an  explicit
               close,  line  numbers  increase  across ARGV files
               (but see examples  under  eof).   (Mnemonic:  many
               programs use . to mean the current line number.)

       $/      The  input  record  separator, newline by default.
               Works like _a_w_k's RS variable,  including  treating
               blank  lines  as  delimiters  if  set  to the null
               string.  You may set it to a multicharacter string
               to  match  a multi-character delimiter.  Note that
               setting it to "\n\n" means something slightly dif-
               ferent than setting it to "", if the file contains
               consecutive blank lines.  Setting it  to  ""  will
               treat  two  or  more  consecutive blank lines as a
               single blank line.   Setting  it  to  "\n\n"  will
               blindly  assume  that  the  next  input  character
               belongs to the next paragraph, even if it's a new-
               line.  (Mnemonic: / is used to delimit line bound-
               aries when quoting poetry.)

       $,      The output field separator for the print operator.
               Ordinarily  the  print  operator simply prints out
               the comma separated fields you specify.  In  order
               to  get  behavior more like _a_w_k, set this variable
               as you would set _a_w_k's  OFS  variable  to  specify
               what  is  printed between fields.  (Mnemonic: what
               is printed when there is a , in your print  state-
               ment.)

       $""     This  is  like  $, except that it applies to array
               values interpolated into  a  double-quoted  string
               (or  similar  interpreted  string).   Default is a
               space.  (Mnemonic: obvious, I think.)

       $\      The output record separator for the  print  opera-
               tor.   Ordinarily the print operator simply prints
               out the comma separated fields you  specify,  with
               no  trailing  newline or record separator assumed.
               In order to get behavior more like _a_w_k,  set  this
               variable  as  you  would set _a_w_k's ORS variable to
               specify what is printed at the end of  the  print.
               (Mnemonic:  you set $\ instead of adding \n at the
               end of the print.  Also, it's  just  like  /,  but
               it's what you get "back" from _p_e_r_l.)

       $#      The output format for printed numbers.  This vari-
               able is a half-hearted attempt  to  emulate  _a_w_k's
               OFMT variable.  There are times, however, when _a_w_k
               and _p_e_r_l have differing notions of what is in fact
               numeric.   Also, the initial value is %.20g rather
               than %.6g, so you need to set $# explicitly to get
               _a_w_k's value.  (Mnemonic: # is the number sign.)

       $%      The  current page number of the currently selected
               output channel.  (Mnemonic: % is  page  number  in
               nroff.)

       $=      The  current  page length (printable lines) of the
               currently selected output channel.  Default is 60.
               (Mnemonic: = has horizontal lines.)

       $-      The  number  of lines left on the page of the cur-
               rently  selected   output   channel.    (Mnemonic:
               lines_on_page - lines_printed.)

       $~      The name of the current report format for the cur-
               rently selected output channel.  Default  is  name
               of the filehandle.  (Mnemonic: brother to $^.)

       $^      The name of the current top-of-page format for the
               currently selected  output  channel.   Default  is
               name  of  the  filehandle  with  "_TOP"  appended.
               (Mnemonic: points to top of page.)

       $|      If set to nonzero,  forces  a  flush  after  every
               write  or  print  on the currently selected output
               channel.  Default is 0.   Note  that  _S_T_D_O_U_T  will
               typically  be  line  buffered  if output is to the
               terminal and block  buffered  otherwise.   Setting

               a _p_e_r_l script under rsh and want to see the output
               as it's happening.  (Mnemonic: when you want  your
               pipes to be piping hot.)

       $$      The  process  number  of  the  _p_e_r_l  running  this
               script.  (Mnemonic: same as shells.)

       $?      The status returned by the last pipe close,  back-
               tick  (``)  command or _s_y_s_t_e_m operator.  Note that
               this is the status word  returned  by  the  wait()
               system  call,  so the exit value of the subprocess
               is actually ($? >> 8).  $? & 255 gives which  sig-
               nal,  if  any,  the process died from, and whether
               there was a core dump.  (Mnemonic: similar  to  sh
               and ksh.)

       $&      The  string matched by the last successful pattern
               match (not counting any matches  hidden  within  a
               BLOCK  or  eval  enclosed  by  the current BLOCK).
               (Mnemonic: like & in some editors.)

       $`      The string preceding whatever was matched  by  the
               last  successful  pattern  match (not counting any
               matches hidden within a BLOCK or eval enclosed  by
               the current BLOCK).  (Mnemonic: ` often precedes a
               quoted string.)

       $'      The string following whatever was matched  by  the
               last  successful  pattern  match (not counting any
               matches hidden within a BLOCK or eval enclosed  by
               the  current BLOCK).  (Mnemonic: ' often follows a
               quoted string.)  Example:

                    $_ = 'abcdefghi';
                    /def/;
                    print "$`:$&:$'\n";      # prints abc:def:ghi


       $+      The last bracket matched by the last  search  pat-
               tern.  This is useful if you don't know which of a
               set of alternative patterns matched.  For example:

                   /Version: (.*)|Revision: (.*)/ && ($rev = $+);

               (Mnemonic: be positive and forward looking.)

       $*      Set to 1 to do multiline matching within a string,
               0 to tell _p_e_r_l that it  can  assume  that  strings
               contain a single line, for the purpose of optimiz-
               ing pattern matches.  Pattern matches  on  strings

               containing multiple newlines can produce confusing
               results when $* is 0.  Default is 0.  (Mnemonic: *
               matches multiple things.)  Note that this variable
               only influences the interpretation of ^ and $.   A
               literal  newline  can be searched for even when $*
               == 0.

       $0      Contains the name of the file containing the  _p_e_r_l
               script  being  executed.  Assigning to $0 modifies
               the argument area that  the  ps(1)  program  sees.
               (Mnemonic: same as sh and ksh.)

       $<digit>
               Contains the subpattern from the corresponding set
               of parentheses in the last  pattern  matched,  not
               counting  patterns  matched  in nested blocks that
               have  been  exited   already.    (Mnemonic:   like
               \digit.)

       $[      The index of the first element in an array, and of
               the first character in a substring.  Default is 0,
               but you could set it to 1 to make _p_e_r_l behave more
               like _a_w_k (or Fortran) when subscripting  and  when
               evaluating  the  index()  and  substr() functions.
               (Mnemonic: [ begins subscripts.)

       $]      The string printed out when you say "perl -v".  It
               can  be  used  to  determine at the beginning of a
               script whether the perl interpreter executing  the
               script is in the right range of versions.  If used
               in a numeric context, returns the version + patch-
               level / 1000.  Example:

                    # see if getc is available
                       ($version,$patchlevel) =
                          $] =~ /(\d+\.\d+).*\nPatch level: (\d+)/;

               it really means

                    $foo{join($;, $a, $b, $c)}

               which means

                    ($foo{$a},$foo{$b},$foo{$c})

               Default is "\034", the  same  as  SUBSEP  in  _a_w_k.
               Note  that  if your keys contain binary data there
               might not be any safe value  for  $;.   (Mnemonic:
               comma  (the  syntactic  subscript  separator) is a
               semi-semicolon.  Yeah, I know, it's  pretty  lame,
               but  $, is already taken for something more impor-
               tant.)

       $!      If used in a numeric context, yields  the  current
               value of errno, with all the usual caveats.  (This
               means that you shouldn't depend on the value of $!
               to  be anything in particular unless you've gotten
               a  specific  error  return  indicating  a   system
               error.)   If  used in a string context, yields the
               corresponding system error string.  You can assign
               to  $! in order to set errno if, for instance, you
               want $! to return the string for error n,  or  you
               want  to  set the exit value for the die operator.

       $@      The perl syntax error message from the  last  eval
               command.   If  null, the last eval parsed and exe-

               may be broken to fill continuation fields  (start-
               ing  with  ^)  in a format.  Default is " \n-", to

               System  file  descriptors  are  passed  to subpro-

               During  an  open, system file descriptors are pre-
               served even if  the  open  fails.   Ordinary  file
               descriptors   are   closed   before  the  open  is
               attempted.

       $^X     The  name  that  Perl itself was executed as, from
               argv[0].

       $ARGV   contains the name of the current file when reading
               from <>.

       @ARGV   The array ARGV contains the command line arguments
               intended for the script.  Note that $#ARGV is  the
               generally  number  of  arguments  minus one, since
               $ARGV[0] is the first argument,  NOT  the  command
               name.  See $0 for the command name.

       @INC    The  array INC contains the list of places to look
               for _p_e_r_l scripts to be evaluated by the "do  EXPR"
               command  or  the  "require" command.  It initially
               consists of the arguments to any --II  command  line
               switches,  followed  by  the default _p_e_r_l library,
               probably "/usr/local/lib/perl", followed  by  ".",
               to represent the current directory.

       %INC    The  associative  array  INC  contains entries for
               each filename that has been included via  "do"  or
               "require".  The key is the filename you specified,
               and the value is the location of the file actually
               found.   The  "require" command uses this array to
               determine whether a given file  has  already  been
               included.

       $ENV{expr}
               The  associative  array  ENV contains your current
               environment.  Setting a value in ENV  changes  the
               environment for child processes.

               handlers for various signals.  Example:

               The SIG array only contains values for the signals
               actually set within the perl script.

       PPaacckkaaggeess

       Perl provides a mechanism for alternate namespaces to pro-
       tect packages from stomping on each others variables.   By
       default,  a  perl script starts compiling into the package
       known as "main".  By use of the _p_a_c_k_a_g_e  declaration,  you
       can  switch namespaces.  The scope of the package declara-
       tion is from the declaration itself  to  the  end  of  the
       enclosing  block (the same scope as the local() operator).
       Typically it would be the first declaration in a  file  to
       be  included  by  the  "require" operator.  You can switch
       into a package in more than one place;  it  merely  influ-
       ences  which  symbol table is used by the compiler for the
       rest of that block.  You can refer to variables and  file-
       handles in other packages by prefixing the identifier with
       the package name and a single quote.  If the package  name
       is null, the "main" package as assumed.

       Only  identifiers  starting with letters are stored in the
       packages symbol table.  All  other  symbols  are  kept  in
       package  "main".  In addition, the identifiers STDIN, STD-
       OUT, STDERR, ARGV, ARGVOUT, ENV, INC and SIG are forced to
       be  in  package  "main", even when used for other purposes
       than their built-in one.  Note also that, if  you  have  a
       package  called  "m",  "s"  or  "y", the you can't use the
       qualified form of an identifier since it  will  be  inter-
       preted  instead  as  a  pattern match, a substitution or a
       translation.

       Eval'ed strings are compiled in the package in  which  the
       eval  was  compiled  in.  (Assignments to $SIG{}, however,
       assume the signal handler specified is in the  main  pack-
       age.   Qualify the signal handler name if you wish to have
       a signal handler in a package.)  For an  example,  examine
       perldb.pl  in  the perl library.  It initially switches to

       the DB package so that the debugger doesn't interfere with
       variables in the script you are trying to debug.  At vari-
       ous points, however, it temporarily switches back  to  the
       main  package  to evaluate various expressions in the con-
       text of the main package.

       The symbol table for a package happens to be stored in the
       associative  array  of  that name prepended with an under-
       score.  The value in each entry of the  associative  array
       is  what you are referring to when you use the *name nota-
       tion.  In fact, the following have  the  same  effect  (in
       package  main, anyway), though the first is more efficient
       because it does the symbol table lookups at compile time:

            local(*foo) = *bar;
            local($_main{'foo'}) = $_main{'bar'};

       You can use this to print out all the variables in a pack-
       age,  for  instance.   Here  is  dumpvar.pl  from the perl
       library:
            package dumpvar;

            sub main'dumpvar {
                ($package) = @_;
                local(*stab) = eval("*_$package");
                while (($key,$val) = each(%stab)) {
                    {
                        local(*entry) = $val;
                        if (defined $entry) {
                            print "\$$key = '$entry'\n";
                        }
                        if (defined @entry) {
                            print "\@$key = (\n";
                            foreach $num ($[ .. $#entry) {
                                print "  $num\t'",$entry[$num],"'\n";
                            }
                            print ")\n";
                        }
                        if ($key ne "_$package" && defined %entry) {
                            print "\%$key = (\n";
                            foreach $key (sort keys(%entry)) {
                                print "  $key\t'",$entry{$key},"'\n";
                            }
                            print ")\n";
                        }
                    }
                }

       age  dumpvar,  the  name of the subroutine is qualified so

       SSttyyllee

       Each programmer will, of course, have his or her own pref-
       erences  in regards to formatting, but there are some gen-
       eral guidelines that will make  your  programs  easier  to
       read.

       1.  Just  because  you  CAN  do something a particular way
           doesn't mean that you SHOULD do it that way.  _P_e_r_l  is
           designed  to  give you several ways to do anything, so
           consider picking the most readable one.  For instance

                open(FOO,$foo) || die "Can't open $foo: $!";

           is better than

                die "Can't open $foo: $!" unless open(FOO,$foo);

           because the second way hides the  main  point  of  the
           statement in a modifier.  On the other hand

                print "Starting analysis\n" if $verbose;

           is better than

                $verbose && print "Starting analysis\n";

           since  the  main point isn't whether the user typed -v
           or not.

           Similarly, just because an operator  lets  you  assume
           default  arguments  doesn't mean that you have to make
           use of the defaults.  The defaults are there for  lazy
           systems programmers writing one-shot programs.  If you
           want your program to be readable,  consider  supplying
           the argument.

           Along the same lines, just because you _c_a_n omit paren-
           theses in many places doesn't mean that you ought to:

                return print reverse sort num values array;
                return print(reverse(sort num (values(%array))));

           When in doubt, parenthesize.  At  the  very  least  it
           will  let some poor schmuck bounce on the % key in vi.

           Even if you aren't in doubt, consider the mental  wel-
           fare  of the person who has to maintain the code after
           you, and who will probably put  parens  in  the  wrong

           place.

       2.  Don't  go  through silly contortions to exit a loop at
           the top or the bottom, when _p_e_r_l provides  the  "last"
           operator  so you can exit in the middle.  Just outdent
           it a little to make it more visible:

               line:
                for (;;) {
                    statements;
                last line if $foo;
                    next line if /^#/;
                    statements;
                }


       3.  Don't be afraid to use loop labels--they're  there  to
           enhance  readability  as  well as to allow multi-level
           loop breaks.  See last example.

       4.  For portability, when using features that may  not  be
           implemented on every machine, test the construct in an
           eval to see if it fails.  If you know what version  or
           patchlevel  a  particular feature was implemented, you
           can test $] to see if it will be there.

       5.  Choose mnemonic identifiers.

       6.  Be consistent.

       DDeebbuuggggiinngg

       If you invoke _p_e_r_l with a --dd switch, your script  will  be
       run  under  a  debugging monitor.  It will halt before the
       first executable statement and ask you for a command, such
       as:

       h           Prints out a help message.

       T           Stack trace.

       _P_e_r_l  is  designed  to make it easy to write secure setuid
       and setgid scripts.  Unlike shells,  which  are  based  on
       multiple  substitution  passes on each line of the script,
       _p_e_r_l uses a more conventional evaluation scheme with fewer
       hidden  "gotchas".   Additionally,  since the language has
       more built-in functionality, it  has  to  rely  less  upon
       external  (and  possibly untrustworthy) programs to accom-
       plish its purposes.

       In an unpatched 4.2 or 4.3bsd kernel, setuid  scripts  are
       intrinsically  insecure,  but  this  kernel feature can be
       disabled.  If it is, _p_e_r_l can emulate the setuid and  set-
       gid  mechanism  when  it  notices  the  otherwise  useless
       setuid/gid bits on perl scripts.  If  the  kernel  feature
       isn't disabled, _p_e_r_l will complain loudly that your setuid
       script is insecure.  You'll need  to  either  disable  the
       kernel  setuid  script  feature, or put a C wrapper around
       the script.

       When perl is executing a setuid script, it  takes  special
       precautions  to  prevent you from falling into any obvious
       traps.  (In some ways, a perl script is more  secure  than
       the  corresponding C program.)  Any command line argument,
       environment variable, or input is marked as "tainted", and
       may  not  be  used, directly or indirectly, in any command
       that invokes a subshell, or in any command  that  modifies
       files, directories or processes.  Any variable that is set
       within an expression  that  has  previously  referenced  a
       tainted  value  also  becomes tainted (even if it is logi-
       cally impossible for the tainted value  to  influence  the
       variable).  For example:

            $foo = shift;            # $foo is tainted
            $bar = $foo,'bar';       # $bar is also tainted
            $xxx = <>;               # Tainted
            $path = $ENV{'PATH'};    # Tainted, but see below
            $abc = 'abc';            # Not tainted

            system "echo $abc";      # Is secure now!

            open(FOO,"$foo");        # OK
            open(FOO,">$foo");       # Not OK

            open(FOO,"echo $foo|");  # Not OK, but...
            open(FOO,"-|") || exec 'echo', $foo;    # OK

            $zzz = `echo $foo`;      # Insecure, zzz tainted

            unlink $abc,$foo;        # Insecure
            umask $foo;              # Insecure

            exec "echo $foo";        # Insecure
            exec "echo", $foo;       # Secure (doesn't use sh)
            exec "sh", '-c', $foo;   # Considered secure, alas

       The  taintedness  is associated with each scalar value, so
       some elements of an array can be tainted, and others  not.

       If  you try to do something insecure, you will get a fatal
       error  saying  something  like  "Insecure  dependency"  or
       "Insecure  PATH".   Note that you can still write an inse-
       cure system call or exec, but  only  by  explicitly  doing
       something  like  the  last  example  above.   You can also
       bypass  the  tainting  mechanism  by  referencing  subpat-
       terns--_p_e_r_l  presumes  that  if  you reference a substring
       using $1, $2, etc, you knew what you were doing  when  you
       wrote the pattern:

            $ARGV[0] =~ /^-P(\w+)$/;
            $printer = $1;      # Not tainted

       This  is  fairly  secure  since  \w+  doesn't  match shell
       metacharacters.  Use of .+ would have been  insecure,  but
       _p_e_r_l  doesn't  check for that, so you must be careful with
       your patterns.  This is the ONLY mechanism for  untainting
       user  supplied filenames if you want to do file operations
       on them (unless you make $> equal to $<).

       It's also possible to get into trouble with  other  opera-
       tions  that  don't  care  whether they use tainted values.

       Make judicious use of the file tests in dealing  with  any
       user-supplied filenames.  When possible, do opens and such

       executed, and to child processes.  However,  scripts  run-

       Accustomed _a_w_k users should take special note of the  fol-
       lowing:

       *   Semicolons are required after all simple statements in
           _p_e_r_l (except at the end of a block).  Newline is not a
           statement delimiter.

       *   Curly brackets are required on ifs and whiles.

       *   Variables begin with $ or @ in _p_e_r_l.

       *   Arrays  index  from  0  unless  you  set $[.  Likewise
           string positions in substr() and index().

       *   You have to decide whether your array has  numeric  or
           string indices.

       *   Associative  array values do not spring into existence
           upon mere reference.

       *   You have to decide whether you want to use  string  or
           numeric comparisons.

       *   Reading  an input line does not split it for you.  You
           get to split it yourself to an array.  And  the  _s_p_l_i_t
           operator has different arguments.

       *   The  current input line is normally in $_, not $0.  It
           generally does not have the newline stripped.  ($0  is
           the name of the program executed.)

       *   $<digit>  does  not refer to fields--it refers to sub-
           strings matched by the last match pattern.

       *   The _p_r_i_n_t statement does not add field and record sep-
           arators unless you set $, and $\.

       *   You must open your files before you print to them.

           operator works as in C.)

       *   The  concatenation  operator  is  ".",  not  the  null

       *   Shells interpret scripts a little bit at a time.  _P_e_r_l
           compiles the whole program before executing it.

       *   The  arguments  are  available  via @ARGV, not $1, $2,
           etc.

       *   The environment is not automatically made available as
           variables.

       The  Perl book, _P_r_o_g_r_a_m_m_i_n_g _P_e_r_l _, has the following omis-
       sions and goofs.

       On page 5, the examples which read

            eval "/usr/bin/perl

       should read

            eval "exec /usr/bin/perl


       On page 195, the equivalent to the System  V  sum  program
       only works for very small files.  To do larger files, use

            undef $/;
            $checksum = unpack("%32C*",<>) % 32767;


       The  descriptions  of  alarm  and  sleep  refer  to signal
       SIGALARM.  These should refer to SIGALRM.

       The --00 switch to set the initial value of $/ was added  to
       Perl after the book went to press.

       The --ll switch now does automatic line ending processing.

       The qx// construct is now a synonym for backticks.

       $0 may now be assigned to set the argument displayed by _p_s
       _(_1_)_.

       The new @###.## format was omitted accidentally  from  the
       description on formats.

       It  wasn't known at press time that s///ee caused multiple
       evaluations of the replacement expression.  This is to  be
       construed as a feature.

       (LIST) x $count now does array replication.

       There  is  now  no limit on the number of parentheses in a
       regular expression.

       In double-quote context, more escapes are  supported:  \e,
       \a,  \x1b,  \c[, \l, \L, \u, \U, \E.  The latter five con-
       trol up/lower case translation.

       The $$// variable may now be set to a multi-character delim-
       iter.

       There  is  now  a  g modifier on ordinary pattern matching
       that causes it to iterate through a string finding  multi-
       ple matches.

       All of the $^X variables are new except for $^T.

       The  default  top-of-form  format  for  FILEHANDLE  is now

       FILEHANDLE_TOP rather than top.

       The eval {} and sort {} constructs were added  in  version
       4.018.

       The  v and V (little-endian) template options for pack and
       unpack were added in 4.019.

BBUUGGSS
       _P_e_r_l is at the mercy of your machine's definitions of var-
       ious   operations   such   as  type  casting,  atof()  and
       sprintf().

       If your stdio requires an seek or eof  between  reads  and
       writes  on  a  particular  stream,  so  does  _p_e_r_l.  (This
       doesn't apply to sysread() and syswrite().)

       While none of the built-in data types have  any  arbitrary
       size  limits  (apart  from memory size), there are still a
       few arbitrary limits: a given identifier may not be longer
       than  255 characters, and no component of your PATH may be
       longer than 255 if you use -S.  A regular  expression  may
       not compile to more than 32767 bytes internally.

       _P_e_r_l  actually  stands for Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish
       Lister, but don't tell anyone I said that.
