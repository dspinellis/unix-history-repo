       _S_e_n_d  will  cause each of the specified files to be deliv-
       ered (via _p_o_s_t (8)) to each of  the  destinations  in  the
       "To:",  "cc:",  "Bcc:",  and "Fcc:" fields of the message.
       If _s_e_n_d is re-distributing  a  message,  as  invoked  from
       _d_i_s_t, then the corresponding "Resent-xxx" fields are exam-
       ined instead.

       If `-push' is specified, _s_e_n_d will detach itself from  the
       user's terminal and perform its actions in the background.
       If _p_u_s_h 'd and the draft can't be sent,  then  the  `-for-
       ward'  switch says that draft should be forwarded with the
       failure notice  sent  to  the  user.   This  differs  from
       putting  _s_e_n_d  in  the  background  because  the output is
       trapped and analyzed by _M_H.

       If `-verbose' is specified, _s_e_n_d will indicate the  inter-
       actions  occurring  with  the  transport  system, prior to
       actual delivery.  If `-watch' is specified _s_e_n_d will moni-
       tor  the  delivery  of  local and network mail.  Hence, by
       specifying both switches, a large  detail  of  information
       can  be  gathered  about  each step of the message's entry
       into the transport system.

       The   `-draftfolder +folder'    and    `-draftmessage msg'
       switches  invoke the _M_H draft folder facility.  This is an
       advanced  (and  highly  useful)  feature.    Consult   the
       AAddvvaanncceedd FFeeaattuurreess section of the _M_H manual for more infor-
       mation.

       If `-split' is specified, _s_e_n_d will split the  draft  into
       one or more partial messages prior to sending.  This makes
       use of the multi-media content feature in MH.   Note  how-
       ever  that  if  _s_e_n_d  is invoked under _d_i_s_t (1), then this
       switch is ignored -- it makes no sense to  redistribute  a
       message in this fashion.  Sometimes you want _s_e_n_d to pause
       after posting a partial message.  This is usually the case
       when you are running _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l and expect to generate a lot
       of partial messages.  The argument to  `-split'  tells  it

       how long to pause between postings.

       _S_e_n_d with no _f_i_l_e argument will query whether the draft is
       the intended file, whereas  `-draft'  will  suppress  this
       question.   Once  the  transport  system  has successfully
       accepted custody of the message, the file will be  renamed
       with  a  leading  comma,  which  allows it to be retrieved
       until the next draft message is sent.  If there are errors
       in  the  formatting of the message, _s_e_n_d will abort with a
       (hopefully) helpful error message.

       If a "Bcc:" field is encountered, its  addresses  will  be
       used  for  delivery,  and the "Bcc:" field will be removed
       from the message sent to sighted  recipients.   The  blind
       recipients  will  receive  an  entirely new message with a
       minimal set of headers.  Included in the body of the  mes-
       sage  will  be  a  copy of the message sent to the sighted
       recipients.  If `-filter filterfile'  is  specified,  then
       this  copy  is filtered (re-formatted) prior to being sent
       to the blind recipients.  Otherwise, to use the MIME rules
       for encapsulation, specify the `-mime' switch.

       Prior    to    sending    the    message,    the    fields
       "From: user@local", and "Date: now" will  be  appended  to
       the  headers in the message.  If the envariable $$SSIIGGNNAATTUURREE
       is set, then its value is used as your personal name  when
       constructing  the  "From:"  line  of the message.  If this
       envariable is not set, then _s_e_n_d will consult the  profile
       entry "Signature" for this information.  On hosts where _M_H
       was configured with the UCI option, if $$SSIIGGNNAATTUURREE  is  not
       set and the "Signature" profile entry is not present, then
       the file $$HHOOMMEE/.signature is consulted.   If  `-msgid'  is
       specified,  then  a "Message-ID:" field will also be added
       to the message.

       If _s_e_n_d is re-distributing  a  message  (when  invoked  by
       _d_i_s_t ),  then "Resent-" will be prepended to each of these
       fields: "From:", "Date:", and "Message-ID:".  If the  mes-
       sage  already  contains  a  "From:" field, then a "Sender:
       user@local" field will be  added  as  well.   (An  already
       existing "Sender:" field is an error!)

       By  using the `-format' switch, each of the entries in the
       "To:" and "cc:" fields will be  replaced  with  "standard"
       format  entries.   This  standard format is designed to be
       usable by all of the message handlers on the various  sys-
       tems  around  the Internet.  If `-noformat' is given, then
       headers are output exactly as they appear in  the  message
       draft.

       If  an  "Fcc: folder"  is encountered, the message will be

       copied to the specified folder for the sender in the  for-
       mat  in  which  it will appear to any non-Bcc receivers of
       the message.  That is, it will have  the  appended  fields
       and field reformatting.  The "Fcc:" fields will be removed
       from all outgoing copies of the message.

       By using the `-width columns' switch, the user can  direct
       _s_e_n_d as to how long it should make header lines containing
       addresses.

       The files specified by the profile entry "Aliasfile:"  and
       any additional alias files given by the `-alias aliasfile'
       switch will be read (more than one file,  each   preceeded
       by  `-alias',  can  be  named).  See _m_h_-_a_l_i_a_s (5) for more
       information.
