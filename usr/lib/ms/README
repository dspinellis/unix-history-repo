This directory, /usr/lib/ms, contains various macro files used
by the -ms package, along with various scripts that are useful
for text formatting.  These scripts are not supported commands--
they are examples that may assist you with document preparation.
These scripts are described below:

endnote
-------
This program takes -ms footnotes (text placed between .FS and .FE
macros) and moves them to the end of your output.  It should be
used with numbered footnotes, which are entered like this:

	this is best explained by Hodgkins.\**
	.FS
	Arthur Hodgkins, \fIThe Bone Marrow,\fP
	Johns Hopkins Press, Baltimore, 1982.
	.FE

When you want to produce numbered endnotes instead of footnotes,
you can run the program as follows:

	% /usr/lib/ms/endnote filename(s) | nroff -ms

Other nroff options, such as -T to specify terminal type, may
also be given.  If you're using refer, tbl, or eqn, they should
follow /usr/lib/ms/endnote, in the proper order.  The endnote
program creates the file "endnotes" in the working directory;
the file is removed afterward endnote finishes.  If this file
already exists, the program exits with an error message.

After a while you may find it more convenient to copy this script
to your own directory, rather than saying /usr/lib/ms/endnote
every time you want to run it.  To do this, type:

	% cp /usr/lib/ms/endnote endnote
	% chmod +x endnote

The first command will copy it into your working directory, and
the second will make it executable.

swapacc
-------
This program takes accent marks in the old -ms format (where they
come before the accented letter) and changes them into the new .AM
format (where the come after the accented letter).

	Old format:	t\*'el\*'ephone
	New format:	te\*'le\*'phone

The swapacc program is best run from inside the editor:

	:1,$ ! /usr/lib/ms/swapacc

The first to the last lines of the editor buffer will be sent to
the shell, which will run /usr/lib/ms/swapacc, and then return
all lines to where they were before.
