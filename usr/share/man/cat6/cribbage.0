     _C_r_i_b_b_a_g_e plays the card game cribbage, with the program
     playing one hand and the user the other.  The program will
     initially ask the user if the rules of the game are needed -
     if so, it will print out the appropriate section from
     _A_c_c_o_r_d_i_n_g _t_o _H_o_y_l_e with _m_o_r_e (_I).

     _C_r_i_b_b_a_g_e options include:

     --ee   When the player makes a mistake scoring his hand or
	  crib, provide an explanation of the correct score.
	  (This is especially useful for beginning players.)

     --qq   Print a shorter form of all messages - this is only
	  recommended for users who have played the game without
	  specifying this option.

     --rr   Instead of asking the player to cut the deck, the pro-
	  gram will randomly cut the deck.

     _C_r_i_b_b_a_g_e first asks the player whether he wishes to play a
     short game ("once around", to 61) or a long game ("twice
     around", to 121).	A response of `s' will result in a short
     game, any other response will play a long game.

     At the start of the first game, the program asks the player
     to cut the deck to determine who gets the first crib.  The
     user should respond with a number between 0 and 51, indicat-
     ing how many cards down the deck is to be cut.  The player
     who cuts the lower ranked card gets the first crib.  If more
     than one game is played, the loser of the previous game gets
     the first crib in the current game.

     For each hand, the program first prints the player's hand,
     whose crib it is, and then asks the player to discard two
     cards into the crib.  The cards are prompted for one per
     line, and are typed as explained below.

     After discarding, the program cuts the deck (if it is the
     player's crib) or asks the player to cut the deck (if it's
     its crib); in the latter case, the appropriate response is a
     number from 0 to 39 indicating how far down the remaining 40
     cards are to be cut.

     After cutting the deck, play starts with the non-dealer (the
     person who doesn't have the crib) leading the first card.

     Play continues, as per cribbage, until all cards are
     exhausted.  The program keeps track of the scoring of all
     points and the total of the cards on the table.

     After play, the hands are scored.	The program requests the
     player to score his hand (and the crib, if it is his) by
     printing out the appropriate cards (and the cut card
     enclosed in brackets).  Play continues until one player
     reaches the game limit (61 or 121).

     A carriage return when a numeric input is expected is
     equivalent to typing the lowest legal value; when cutting
     the deck this is equivalent to choosing the top card.

     Cards are specified as rank followed by suit.  The ranks may
     be specified as one of: `a', `2', `3', `4', `5', `6', `7',
     `8', `9', `t', `j', `q', and `k', or alternatively, one of:
     "ace", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven",
     "eight", "nine", "ten", "jack", "queen", and "king".  Suits
     may be specified as: `s', `h', `d', and `c', or alterna-
     tively as: "spades", "hearts", "diamonds", and "clubs".  A
     card may be specified as: <rank> " " <suit>, or: <rank> " of
     " <suit>.	If the single letter rank and suit designations
     are used, the space separating the suit and rank may be left
     out.  Also, if only one card of the desired rank is play-
     able, typing the rank is sufficient.  For example, if your
     hand was "2H, 4D, 5C, 6H, JC, KD" and it was desired to dis-
     card the king of diamonds, any of the following could be
     typed: "k", "king", "kd", "k d", "k of d", "king d", "king
     of d", "k diamonds", "k of diamonds", "king diamonds", or
     "king of diamonds".
