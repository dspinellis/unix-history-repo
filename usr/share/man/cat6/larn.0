     Welcome to the game of _L_a_r_n.  At this moment, you face a
     great problem.  Your daughter has contracted a strange
     disease, and none of your home remedies seem to have any
     effect.  You sense that she is in mortal danger, and you
     must try to save her.  Time ago you heard of a land of great
     danger and opportunity.  Perhaps here is the solution you
     need.

     It has been said that there once was a great magician who
     called himself Polinneaus.  Many years ago, after having
     many miraculous successes, Polinneaus retired to the caverns
     of Larn, where he devoted most of his time to the creation
     of magic.	Rumors have it that one day Polinneaus set out to
     dispel an attacking army in a forest some distance to the
     north.  It is believed that here he met his demise.

     The caverns of Larn, it is thought, must be magnificent in
     design, and contain much magic and treasure.  One option you
     have is to undertake a journey into these caverns.

     Good Luck!  You're going to need it!
