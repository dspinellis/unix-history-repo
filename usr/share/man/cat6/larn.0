     LLaarrnn is a fantasy games in which your child has contracted a strange dis-
     ease, and none of your home remedies seem to have any effect.  You set
     out to find a remedy in a limited amount of time, and to collect gold
     along the way of course!

     The options are:

     --rr    The --rr option restores a checkpointed game after it has died.

     --HH    The --HH option sets the hardness of the game.

     --nn    The --nn option suppresses the welcome message at start up, putting
           you directly into the game.

     --hh    The --hh option prints the command line options.

     --oo    The --oo option specifies a different options file than _~_/_._l_a_r_n_o_p_t_s.

     When ddrrooppppiinngg ggoolldd, if you type '*' as your amount, all your gold gets
     dropped.  In general, typing in '*' means all of what your interested in.
     This is true when visiting the bank, or when contributing at altars.

     You can get out of the store, trading post, school, or home by hitting
     <<eesscc>>.

     When casting a spell, if you need a list of spells you can cast, type DD
     as the first letter of your spell.  The available list of spells will be
     shown, after which you may enter the spell code.  This only works on the
     1st letter of the spell you are casting.
