     When ffoorrttuunnee is run with no arguments it prints out a random epigram.
     Epigrams are divided into several categories, where each category is sub-
     divided into those which are potentially offensive and those which are
     not.  The options are as follows:

     --aa    Choose from all lists of maxims, both offensive and not.  (See the
           --oo option for more information on offensive fortunes.)

     --ee    Consider all fortune files to be of equal size (see discussion be-
           low on multiple files).

     --ff    Print out the list of files which would be searched, but don't
           print a fortune.

     --ll    Long dictums only.

     --mm    Print out all fortunes which match the regular expression _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.
           See regex(3) for a description of patterns.

     --oo    Choose only from potentially offensive aphorisms.  PPlleeaassee,, pplleeaassee,,

                 ... let us keep in mind the basic governing philosophy of The
                 Brotherhood, as handsomely summarized in these words: we be-
                 lieve in healthy, hearty laughter -- at the expense of the
                 whole human race, if needs be.  Needs be.
                             --H. Allen Smith, "Rude Jokes"

     --ss    Short apothegms only.

     --ii    Ignore case for --mm patterns.

     --ww    Wait before termination for an amount of time calculated from the
           number of characters in the message.  This is useful if it is exe-
           cuted as part of the logout procedure to guarantee that the message
           can be read before the screen is cleared.

     The user may specify alternate sayings.  You can specify a specific file,
     a directory which contains one or more files, or the special word _a_l_l
     which says to use all the standard databases.  Any of these may be pre-
     ceded by a percentage, which is a number _N between 0 and 100 inclusive,
     followed by a _%. If it is, there will be a _N percent probability that an
     adage will be picked from that file or directory.  If the percentages do
     not sum to 100, and there are specifications without percentages, the re-
     maining percent will apply to those files and/or directories, in which
     case the probability of selecting from one of them will be based on their
     relative sizes.

     As an example, given two databases _f_u_n_n_y and _n_o_t_-_f_u_n_n_y, with _f_u_n_n_y twice
     as big, saying

           fortune funny not-funny


     will get you fortunes out of _f_u_n_n_y two-thirds of the time.  The command

           fortune 90% funny 10% not-funny

     will pick out 90% of its fortunes from _f_u_n_n_y (the ``10% not-funny'' is
     unnecessary, since 10% is all that's left).  The --ee option says to con-
     sider all files equal; thus

           fortune -e

     is equivalent to

           fortune 50% funny 50% notEm -funny
