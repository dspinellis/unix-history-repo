     The game _w_u_m_p is based on a fantasy game first presented in
     the pages of _P_e_o_p_l_e'_s _C_o_m_p_u_t_e_r _C_o_m_p_a_n_y in 1973.  In Hunt the
     Wumpus you are placed in a cave built of many different
     rooms, all interconnected by tunnels.  Your quest is to find
     and shoot the evil Wumpus that resides elsewhere in the cave
     without running into any pits or using up your limited sup-
     ply of arrows.

     The options are as follows:

     -_a   Specifies the number of magic arrows the adventurer
	  gets.  The default is five.

     -_b   Specifies the number of rooms in the cave which contain
	  bats.  The default is three.

     -_h   Play the hard version -- more pits, more bats, and a
	  generally more dangerous cave.

     -_n   Specifies the number of rooms in the cave which contain
	  bottomless pits.  The default is three.

     -_r   Specifies the number of rooms in the cave.  The default
	  cave size is twenty-five rooms.

     -_t   Specifies the number of tunnels connecting each room in
	  the cave to another room.  Beware, too many tunnels in
	  a small cave can easily cause it to collapse!  The
	  default cave room has three tunnels to other rooms.

     While wandering through the cave you'll notice that, while
     there are tunnels everywhere, there are some mysterious
     quirks to the cave topology, including some tunnels that go
     from one room to another, but not necessarily back!  Also,
     most pesky of all are the rooms that are home to large
     numbers of bats, which, upon being disturbed, will en masse
     grab you and move you to another portion of the cave
     (including those housing bottomless pits, sure death for
     unwary explorers).

     Fortunately, you're not going into the cave without any
     weapons or tools, and in fact your biggest aids are your
     senses; you can often smell the rather odiferous Wumpus up
     to _t_w_o rooms away, and you can always feel the drafts

     created by the occasional bottomless pit and hear the rustle
     of the bats in caves they might be sleeping within.

     To kill the wumpus, you'll need to shoot it with one of your
     magic arrows.  Fortunately, you don't have to be in the same
     room as the creature, and can instead shoot the arrow from
     as far as three or four rooms away!

     When you shoot an arrow, you do so by typing in a list of
     rooms that you'd like it to travel to.  If at any point in
     its travels it cannot find a tunnel to the room you specify
     from the room it's in, it will instead randomly fly down one
     of the tunnels, possibly, if you're real unlucky, even fly-
     ing back into the room you're in and hitting you!
