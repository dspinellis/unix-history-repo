DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     This file refers to the paging device in use by the system.  This may ac-
     tually be a subdevice of one of the disk drivers, but in a system with
     paging interleaved across multiple disk drives it provides an indirect
     driver for the multiple drives.

     The ddrruumm special file appeared in 3.0BSD.

BBUUGGSS
     Reads from the drum are not allowed across the interleaving boundaries.
     Since these only occur every .5Mbytes or so, and since the system never
     allocates blocks across the boundary, this is usually not a problem.
