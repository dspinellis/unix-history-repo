     grf - HP graphics frame buffer device interface

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     This is a generic description of the frame buffer device
     interface.  The devices to which this applies are the 98544,
     98545 and 98547 Topcat display cards (also known as HP300H
     devices), the 98548, 98549 and 98550 Catseye display cards,
     the 98700 Gatorbox graphics box, the 98720 Renaissance
     graphics box, and the 98730 DaVinci graphics box.

     Use of the devices can be effectively approached from two
     directions.  The first is through HP-UX _S_t_a_r_b_a_s_e routines,
     the second is by direct control in the BSD environment.  In
     order to use the Starbase libraries, code must be compiled
     in an HP-UX environment, either by doing so on an HP-UX
     machine and transferring the binaries to the BSD machine, or
     by compilation with the use of the _h_p_u_x(1) command.  Appli-
     cations using Starbase libraries have been run successfully
     on BSD machines using both of these compilation techniques.

     Direct compilation, such as that used for the X Window Sys-
     tem servers, has also been successful.  Examples of some
     frame buffer operations can be found in the device dependent
     X Window system sources, for example the
     /_u_s_r/_s_r_c/_n_e_w/_X/_l_i_b_h_p._f_b directory.  These files contain
     examples of device dependent color map initialization, frame
     buffer operations, bit moving routines etc.

     The basic programming of the _g_r_f?	devices involves opening
     the device file, mapping the control registers and frame
     buffer addresses into user space, and then manipulating the
     device as the application requires.  The address mapping is
     controlled by an _i_o_c_t_l(2) call to map the device into user
     space, and an unmap call when finished.  The ioctls sup-
     ported by BSD are:

     GRFIOCGINFO
	  Get Graphics Info

	  Get info about device, setting the entries in the
	  _g_r_f_i_n_f_o structure, as defined in <hpdev/grfioctl.h>:

	  struct    grfinfo {
	       int	 gd_id;              /* HPUX identifier */
	       caddr_t	 gd_regaddr;	     /* control registers physaddr */
	       int	 gd_regsize;	     /* control registers size */
	       caddr_t	 gd_fbaddr;	     /* frame buffer physaddr */
	       int	 gd_fbsize;	     /* frame buffer size */
	       short	 gd_colors;	     /* number of colors */
	       short	 gd_planes;	     /* number of planes */
	  /* new stuff */

	       int	 gd_fbwidth;	     /* frame buffer width */
	       int	 gd_fbheight;	     /* frame buffer height */
	       int	 gd_dwidth;	     /* displayed part width */
	       int	 gd_dheight;	     /* displayed part height */
	       int	 gd_pad[6];	     /* for future expansion */
	  };

     GRFIOCON
	  Graphics On

	  Turn graphics on by enabling CRT output.  The screen
	  will come on, displaying whatever is in the frame
	  buffer, using whatever colormap is in place.

     GRFIOCOFF
	  Graphics Off

	  Turn graphics off by disabling output to the CRT.  The
	  frame buffer contents are not affected.

     GRFIOCMAP
	  Map Device to user space

	  Map in control registers and framebuffer space. Once
	  the device file is mapped, the frame buffer structure
	  is accessible.

     GRFIOCUNMAP
	  Unmap Device

	  Unmap control registers and framebuffer space.

     For further information about the use of ioctl see the man
     page.

     This short code fragment is an example of opening some
     graphics device and mapping in the control and frame buffer
     space:

	  #define GRF_DEV <some_graphics_device>  /* /dev/grfN */
	  {
	      struct fbstruct *regs;  /*  fbstruct = gboxfb, rboxfb, etc. */
	      u_char *Addr, frame_buffer;
	      struct grfinfo gi;
	      int disp_fd;

		disp_fd = open(GRF_DEV,1);
		if (ioctl (disp_fd, GRFIOCGINFO, &gi) < 0) return -1;
		(void) ioctl (disp_fd, GRFIOCON, 0);

		Addr = (u_char *) 0;

		     return -1;

		regs = (fbstruct *) Addr;			/* Control Registers   */
		frame_buffer = (u_char *) Addr + gi.gd_regsize; /* Frame buffer memory */
	  }
