     rb - HP98720 ``Renaissance'' device interface

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     This driver is for the HP98720 and 98721 graphics device,
     also known as the Renaissance.  This driver has not been
     tested with all possible combinations of frame buffer boards
     and scan boards installed in the device.  The driver merely
     checks for the existence of the device and does minimal set
     up.

     The Renaissance can be configured at either the ``internal''
     address (frame buffer address 0x200000, control register
     space address 0x560000) or at an external select code less
     than 32.  At the internal address it will be the ``pre-
     ferred'' console device (see _c_o_n_s(4)).  The hardware instal-
     lation manual describes the procedure for setting these
     values.

     A user process communicates to the device initially by means
     of _i_o_c_t_l(2) calls.  For the HP-UX ioctl calls supported,
     refer to HP-UX manuals.  The BSD calls supported are:

     GRFIOCGINFO
	  Get Graphics Info

	  Get info about device, setting the entries in the
	  _g_r_f_i_n_f_o structure, as defined in <hpdev/grfioctl.h>.
	  For the standard 98720, the number of planes should be
	  4.  The number of colors would therefore be 15, exclud-
	  ing black.  If one 98722A frame buffer board is
	  installed, there will still be 4 planes, with the 4
	  planes on the colormap board becoming overlay planes.
	  With each additional 98722 frame buffer board 4 planes
	  will be added up to a maximum of 32 planes total.

     GRFIOCON
	  Graphics On

	  Turn graphics on by enabling CRT output.  The screen
	  will come on, displaying whatever is in the frame
	  buffer, using whatever colormap is in place.

     GRFIOCOFF
	  Graphics Off

	  Turn graphics off by disabling output to the CRT.  The
	  frame buffer contents are not affected.

     GRFIOCMAP
	  Map Device to user space

	  Map in control registers and framebuffer space. Once
	  the device file is mapped, the frame buffer structure
	  is accessible.  The structure describing the 98720 is
	  defined in <hpdev/grf_rbreg.h>.

     This is a short segment of code showing how the device is
     opened and mapped into user process address space assuming
     that it is grf0:

	  {
	      struct rboxfb *rbox;
	      u_char *Addr, frame_buffer;
	      struct grfinfo gi;
	      int disp_fd;

		disp_fd = open("/dev/grf0",1);

		if (ioctl (disp_fd, GRFIOCGINFO, &gi) < 0) return -1;

		(void) ioctl (disp_fd, GRFIOCON, 0);

		Addr = (u_char *) 0;
		if (ioctl (disp_fd, GRFIOCMAP, &Addr) < 0) {
		     (void) ioctl (disp_fd, GRFIOCOFF, 0);
		     return -1;
		}
		rbox = (rboxfb *) Addr;                         /* Control Registers   */
		frame_buffer = (u_char *) Addr + gi.gd_regsize; /* Frame buffer memory */
	  }
