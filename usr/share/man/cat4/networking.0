     This section is a general introduction to the networking
     facilities available in the system.  Documentation in this
     part of section 4 is broken up into three areas: _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l
     _f_a_m_i_l_i_e_s (domains), _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l_s, and _n_e_t_w_o_r_k _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e_s.

     All network protocols are associated with a specific _p_r_o_t_o_-
     _c_o_l _f_a_m_i_l_y.  A protocol family provides basic services to
     the protocol implementation to allow it to function within a
     specific network environment.  These services may include
     packet fragmentation and reassembly, routing, addressing,
     and basic transport.  A protocol family may support multiple
     methods of addressing, though the current protocol implemen-
     tations do not.  A protocol family is normally comprised of
     a number of protocols, one per _s_o_c_k_e_t(2) type.  It is not
     required that a protocol family support all socket types.	A
     protocol family may contain multiple protocols supporting
     the same socket abstraction.

     A protocol supports one of the socket abstractions detailed
     in _s_o_c_k_e_t(2).  A specific protocol may be accessed either by
     creating a socket of the appropriate type and protocol fam-
     ily, or by requesting the protocol explicitly when creating
     a socket.	Protocols normally accept only one type of
     address format, usually determined by the addressing struc-
     ture inherent in the design of the protocol family/network
     architecture.  Certain semantics of the basic socket
     abstractions are protocol specific.  All protocols are
     expected to support the basic model for their particular
     socket type, but may, in addition, provide non-standard
     facilities or extensions to a mechanism.  For example, a
     protocol supporting the SOCK_STREAM abstraction may allow
     more than one byte of out-of-band data to be transmitted per
     out-of-band message.

     A network interface is similar to a device interface.  Net-
     work interfaces comprise the lowest layer of the networking
     subsystem, interacting with the actual transport hardware.
     An interface may support one or more protocol families
     and/or address formats.  The SYNOPSIS section of each net-
     work interface entry gives a sample specification of the
     related drivers for use in providing a system description to
     the _c_o_n_f_i_g(8) program.  The DIAGNOSTICS section lists mes-
     sages which may appear on the console and/or in the system

     The system currently supports the DARPA Internet protocols,
     the Xerox Network Systems(tm) protocols, and some of the ISO
     OSI protocols.  Raw socket interfaces are provided to the IP
     protocol layer of the DARPA Internet, to the IMP link layer
     (1822), and to the IDP protocol of Xerox NS.  Consult the
     appropriate manual pages in this section for more informa-
     tion regarding the support for each protocol family.

AADDDDRREESSSSIINNGG
     Associated with each protocol family is an address format.
     All network address adhere to a general structure, called a
     sockaddr, described below. However, each protocol imposes
     finer and more specific structure, generally renaming the
     variant, which is discussed in the protocol family manual
     page alluded to above.
     struct sockaddr {
	    u_char    sa_len;
	    u_char    sa_family;
	    char      sa_data[14];
     };

     The field sa_len contains the total length of the of the
     structure, which may exceed 16 bytes.  The following address
     values for _s_a__f_a_m_i_l_y are known to the system (and additional
     formats are defined for possible future implementation):

     #define AF_UNIX	       1      /* local to host (pipes, portals) */
     #define AF_INET	       2      /* internetwork: UDP, TCP, etc. */
     #define AF_IMPLINK        3      /* arpanet imp addresses */
     #define AF_NS	       6      /* Xerox NS protocols */
     #define AF_CCITT	       10     /* CCITT protocols, X.25 etc */
     #define AF_HYLINK	       15     /* NSC Hyperchannel */
     #define AF_ISO	       18     /* ISO protocols */

RROOUUTTIINNGG
     provides some packet routing facilities.  The kernel main-
     tains a routing information database, which is used in
     selecting the appropriate network interface when transmit-
     ting packets.

     A user process (or possibly multiple co-operating processes)
     maintains this database by sending messages over a special
     kind of socket.  This supplants fixed size _i_o_c_t_l's used in
     earlier releases.

     This facility is described in _r_o_u_t_e(4).

     Each network interface in a system corresponds to a path
     through which messages may be sent and received.  A network
     interface usually has a hardware device associated with it,
     though certain interfaces such as the loopback interface,
     _l_o(4), do not.

     The following _i_o_c_t_l calls may be used to manipulate network
     interfaces.  The _i_o_c_t_l is made on a socket (typically of
     type SOCK_DGRAM) in the desired domain.  Most of the
     requests supported in earlier releases take an _i_f_r_e_q struc-
     ture as its parameter.  This structure has the form

     struct    ifreq {
     #define   IFNAMSIZ  16
	  char ifr_name[IFNAMSIZE];	     /* if name, e.g. "en0" */
	  union {
	       struct	 sockaddr ifru_addr;
	       struct	 sockaddr ifru_dstaddr;
	       struct	 sockaddr ifru_broadaddr;
	       short	 ifru_flags;
	       int  ifru_metric;
	       caddr_t	 ifru_data;
	  } ifr_ifru;
     #define   ifr_addr  ifr_ifru.ifru_addr  /* address */
     #define   ifr_dstaddr    ifr_ifru.ifru_dstaddr    /* other end of p-to-p link */
     #define   ifr_broadaddr  ifr_ifru.ifru_broadaddr  /* broadcast address */
     #define   ifr_flags ifr_ifru.ifru_flags /* flags */
     #define   ifr_metric     ifr_ifru.ifru_metric     /* metric */
     #define   ifr_data  ifr_ifru.ifru_data  /* for use by interface */
     };
     Calls which are now depricated are:

     SIOCSIFADDR
	  Set interface address for protocol family.  Following
	  the address assignment, the ``initialization'' routine
	  for the interface is called.

     SIOCSIFDSTADDR
	  Set point to point address for protocol family and
	  interface.

     SIOCSIFBRDADDR
	  Set broadcast address for protocol family and inter-
	  face.

     _I_o_c_t_l_s requests to obtain addresses and requests both to set
     and retreive other data are still fully supported and use
     the _i_f_r_e_q structure:

     SIOCGIFADDR
	  Get interface address for protocol family.

NETINTRO(4)		      1990		      NETINTRO(4)



     SIOCGIFDSTADDR
	  Get point to point address for protocol family and
	  interface.

     SIOCGIFBRDADDR
	  Get broadcast address for protocol family and inter-
	  face.

     SIOCSIFFLAGS
	  Set interface flags field.  If the interface is marked
	  down, any processes currently routing packets through
	  the interface are notified; some interfaces may be
	  reset so that incoming packets are no longer received.
	  When marked up again, the interface is reinitialized.

     SIOCGIFFLAGS
	  Get interface flags.

     SIOCSIFMETRIC
	  Set interface routing metric.  The metric is used only
	  by user-level routers.

     SIOCGIFMETRIC
	  Get interface metric.

     There are two requests that make use of a new structure:

     SIOCAIFADDR
	  An interface may have more than one address associated
	  with it in some protocols.  This request provides a
	  means to add additional addresses (or modify charac-
	  teristics of the primary address if the default address
	  for the address family is specified).  Rather than mak-
	  ing separate calls to set destination or broadcast
	  addresses, or network masks (now an integral feature of
	  multiple protocols) a separate structure is used to
	  specify all three facets simultaneously:

	  struct ifaliasreq {
		  char	  ifra_name[IFNAMSIZ];	     /* if name, e.g. "en0" */
		  struct  sockaddr  ifra_addr;
		  struct  sockaddr  ifra_broadaddr;
		  struct  sockaddr  ifra_mask;
	  };
	  One would use a slightly tailored version of this
	  struct specific to each family (replacing each sockaddr
	  by one of the family-specific type).	Where the
	  sockaddr itself is larger than the default size, one
	  needs to modify the _i_o_c_t_l identifier itself to include
	  the total size, as described in _i_o_c_t_l(2).

     SIOCDIFADDR

	  This requests deletes the specified address from the
	  list associated with an interface.  It also uses the
	  if_aliasreq structure to allow for the possibility of
	  protocols allowing multiple masks or destination
	  addresses, and also adopts the convention that specifi-
	  cation of the default address means to delete the first
	  address for the interface belonging to the address fam-
	  ily in which the original socket was opened.

     SIOCGIFCONF
	  Get interface configuration list.  This request takes
	  an _i_f_c_o_n_f structure (see below) as a value-result
	  parameter.  The _i_f_c__l_e_n field should be initially set
	  to the size of the buffer pointed to by _i_f_c__b_u_f.  On
	  return it will contain the length, in bytes, of the
	  configuration list.

     /*
      * Structure used in SIOCGIFCONF request.
      * Used to retrieve interface configuration
      * for machine (useful for programs which
      * must know all networks accessible).
      */
     struct    ifconf {
	  int  ifc_len;       /* size of associated buffer */
	  union {
	       caddr_t	 ifcu_buf;
	       struct	 ifreq *ifcu_req;
	  } ifc_ifcu;
     #define   ifc_buf	 ifc_ifcu.ifcu_buf   /* buffer address */
     #define   ifc_req	 ifc_ifcu.ifcu_req   /* array of structures returned */
     };
