     The _N_P device provides access to an Interlan Np100 Ethernet
     interface for control functions.

     This interface is unusual in that it requires loading
     firmware into the controller before it may be used as a net-
     work link-level interface.  This is accomplished by opening
     a character special device, and writing data to it.  It is
     also possible to do post-mortem debugging of firmware
     failures by reading the local memory of the device.

     A program to load the image is provided in
     /usr/src/new/np100.  The sequence of commands would be:

	  # ./npload np.image [/dev/np00]
	  # sleep 10
	  # ifconfig ix0 ...

     Multiple control processes are allowed by opening separate
     minor devices; secondary interfaces are specified by shift-
     ing the interface number by 4 bits.

     The device also responds to commands passed through the
     driver by the following ioctls:

     NPRESET
	  kills off all active network processes.

     NPSTART
	  begins execution of the board at the specified address
	  (usually 0x400).

     NPNETBOOT
	  downloads the image from a server on the network.

     read or write operation causing it to run out of buffers
     before it finished the operation.	This indicates a kernel
     failure rather than a device failure.

     tialization, such that the unibus address expected for the
     board was found to be bad.  Probably indicates hardware
     problems with the board, as do the following:

     an internal resource to be exhausted.  This should never
     happen.

     There are 110 other diagnostic messages that can be enabled
     by setting bits in a debugging mask.  Consult the driver for
     details.
