     The _p_c_l device provides an IP-only interface to the DEC CSS
     PCL-11 time division multiplexed network bus.  The con-
     troller itself is not accessible to users.

     The hosts's address is specified with the SIOCSIFADDR ioctl.
     The interface will not transmit or receive any data before
     its address is defined.

     As the PCL-11 hardware is only capable of having 15 inter-
     faces per network, a single-byte host-on-network number is
     used, with range [1..15] to match the TDM bus addresses of
     the interfaces.

     The interface currently only supports the Internet protocol
     family and only provides ``natural'' (header) encapsulation.

     initialize the device.  This is likely to occur when the
     device is run on a buffered data path on an 11/750 and other
     network interfaces are also configured to use buffered data
     paths, or when it is configured to use buffered data paths
     on an 11/730 (which has none).

     sage with addresses formatted in an unsuitable address fam-
     ily;  the packet was dropped.

     output had previously been started.

     ppccll%%dd:: mmaasstteerr.  The TDM bus had no station providing ``bus
     master'' timing signals, so this interface has assumed the
     ``master'' role.  This message should only appear at most
     once per UNIBUS INIT on a single system.  Unless there is a
     hardware failure, only one station may be master at at time.

     problem sending data on output.  If a ``receiver offline''
     error is detected, it is not normally logged unless the
     option PCL_TESTING has been selected, as this causes a lot
     of console chatter when sending to a down machine.  However,
     this option is quite useful when debugging problems with the
     PCL interfaces.

     transfer of less than 0 or more than 1008 bytes of data into
     memory (according to the word count register).  This should
     never happen as the maximum size of a PCL message has been
     agreed upon to be 1008 bytes (same as ArpaNet message).
