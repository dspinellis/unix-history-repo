     The _h_y interface provides access to a Network Systems Cor-
     poration Hyperchannel Adapter.

     The network to which the interface is attached is specified
     at boot time with an SIOCSIFADDR ioctl. The host's address
     is discovered by reading the adapter status register.  The
     interface will not transmit or receive packets until the
     network number is known.

     cate UNIBUS resources. This is usually due to having too
     many network devices on an 11/750 where there are only 3
     buffered data paths.

     If the adapter does not respond to the status command issued
     during autoconfigure, the adapter is assumed down.  A reboot
     is required to recognize it.

     The adapter power fail interrupt seems to occur sporadically
     when power has, in fact, not failed.  The driver will
     believe that power has failed only if it can not reset the
     power fail latch after a ``reasonable'' time interval.
     These seem to appear about 2-4 times a day on some machines.
     There seems to be no correlation with adapter rev level,
     number of ports used etc. and whether a machine will get
     these ``bogus powerfails''.  They don't seem to cause any
     real problems so they have been ignored.
