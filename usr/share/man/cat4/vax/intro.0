     intro - introduction to special files and hardware support

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     This section describes the special files, related driver
     functions, and networking support available in the system.
     In this part of the manual, the SYNOPSIS section of each
     configurable device gives a sample specification for use in
     constructing a system description for the _c_o_n_f_i_g(8) program.
     The DIAGNOSTICS section lists messages which may appear on
     the console and/or in the system error log /_v_a_r/_l_o_g/_m_e_s_s_a_g_e_s
     due to errors in device operation; see _s_y_s_l_o_g_d(8) for more
     information.

     This section describes the hardware supported on the DEC
     VAX-11.  Software support for these devices comes in two
     forms.  A hardware device may be supported with a character
     or block _d_e_v_i_c_e _d_r_i_v_e_r, or it may be used within the net-
     working subsystem and have a _n_e_t_w_o_r_k _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e _d_r_i_v_e_r.
     Block and character devices are accessed through files in
     the file system of a special type; c.f.  _m_k_n_o_d(8).  Network
     interfaces are indirectly accessed through the interprocess
     communication facilities provided by the system; see
     _s_o_c_k_e_t(2).

     A hardware device is identified to the system at configura-
     tion time and the appropriate device or network interface
     driver is then compiled into the system.  When the resultant
     system is booted, the autoconfiguration facilities in the
     system probe for the device on either the UNIBUS (or Q-bus)
     or MASSBUS and, if found, enable the software support for
     it.  If a UNIBUS device does not respond at autoconfigura-
     tion time it is not accessible at any time afterwards.  To
     enable a UNIBUS device which did not autoconfigure, the sys-
     tem will have to be rebooted.  If a MASSBUS device comes
     ``on-line'' after the autoconfiguration sequence it will be
     dynamically autoconfigured into the running system.

     The autoconfiguration system is described in _a_u_t_o_c_o_n_f(4).	A
     list of the supported devices is given below.

     The devices listed below are supported in this incarnation
     of the system.  Pseudo-devices are not listed.  Devices are
     indicated by their functional interface.  If second vendor
     products provide functionally identical interfaces they
