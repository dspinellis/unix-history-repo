     mtio - UNIX magtape interface

     The files _m_t_0, ..., _m_t_1_5 refer to the UNIX magtape drives,
     which may be on the MASSBUS using the TM03 formatter _h_t(4),
     or TM78 formatter, _m_t(4), or on the UNIBUS using either the
     TM11 or TS11 formatters _t_m(4), TU45 compatible formatters,
     _u_t(4), or _t_s(4).  The following description applies to any
     of the transport/controller pairs.  The files _m_t_0, ..., _m_t_7
     are 800bpi (or the transport's lowest density), _m_t_8, ...,
     _m_t_1_5 are 1600bpi (or the transport's second density), and
     _m_t_1_6, ..., _m_t_2_3 are 6250bpi (or the transport's third den-
     sity).  (But note that only 1600 bpi is available with the
     TS11.) The files _m_t_0, ..., _m_t_3, _m_t_8, ..., _m_t_1_1, and _m_t_1_6,
     ..., _m_t_1_9 are rewound when closed; the others are not.  When
     a file open for writing is closed, two end-of-files are
     written.  If the tape is not to be rewound it is positioned
     with the head between the two tapemarks.

     A standard tape consists of a series of 1024 byte records
     terminated by an end-of-file.  To the extent possible, the
     system makes it possible, if inefficient, to treat the tape
     like any other file.  Seeks have their usual meaning and it
     is possible to read or write a byte at a time.  Writing in
     very small units is inadvisable, however, because it uses
     most of the tape in record gaps.

     The _m_t files discussed above are useful when it is desired
     to access the tape in a way compatible with ordinary files.
     When foreign tapes are to be dealt with, and especially when
     long records are to be read or written, the `raw' interface
     is appropriate.  The associated files are named _r_m_t_0, ...,
     _r_m_t_2_3, but the same minor-device considerations as for the
     regular files still apply.  A number of other ioctl opera-
     tions are available on raw magnetic tape.	The following
     definitions are from <_s_y_s/_m_t_i_o._h>:

     Each _r_e_a_d or _w_r_i_t_e call reads or writes the next record on
     the tape.	In the write case the record has the same length
     as the buffer given.  During a read, the record size is
     passed back as the number of bytes read, provided it is no
     greater than the buffer size; if the record is long, an
     error is indicated.  In raw tape I/O seeks are ignored.  A

     The status should be returned in a device independent for-
     mat.

     The special file naming should be redone in a more con-
     sistent and understandable manner.
