     UNIX provides some packet routing facilities.  The kernel maintains a
     routing information database, which is used in selecting the appropriate
     network interface when transmitting packets.

     A user process (or possibly multiple co-operating processes) maintains
     this database by sending messages over a special kind of socket.  This
     supplants fixed size ioctl(2)'s  used in earlier releases.  Routing table
     changes may only be carried out by the super user.

     The operating system may spontaneously emit routing messages in response
     to external events, such as receipt of a re-direct, or failure to locate
     a suitable route for a request.  The message types are described in
     greater detail below.

     Routing database entries come in two flavors: for a specific host, or for
     all hosts on a generic subnetwork (as specified by a bit mask and value
     under the mask.  The effect of wildcard or default route may be achieved
     by using a mask of all zeros, and there may be hierarchical routes.

     When the system is booted and addresses are assigned to the network in-
     terfaces, each protocol family installs a routing table entry for each
     interface when it is ready for traffic.  Normally the protocol specifies
     the route through each interface as a ``direct'' connection to the desti-
     nation host or network.  If the route is direct, the transport layer of a
     protocol family usually requests the packet be sent to the same host
     specified in the packet.  Otherwise, the interface is requested to ad-
     dress the packet to the gateway listed in the routing entry (i.e. the
     packet is forwarded).

     When routing a packet, the kernel will attempt to find the most specific
     route matching the destination.  (If there are two different mask and
     value-under-the-mask pairs that match, the more specific is the one with
     more bits in the mask.  A route to a host is regarded as being supplied
     with a mask of as many ones as there are bits in the destination).  If no
     entry is found, the destination is declared to be unreachable, and a
     routing-miss message is generated if there are any listers on the routing
     control socket described below.

     A wildcard routing entry is specified with a zero destination address
     value, and a mask of all zeroes.  Wildcard routes will be used when the
     system fails to find other routes matching the destination.  The combina-
     tion of wildcard routes and routing redirects can provide an economical
     mechanism for routing traffic.

     One opens the channel for passing routing control messages by using the
     socket call shown in the synopsis above:

     The _f_a_m_i_l_y parameter may be AF_UNSPEC which will provide routing informa-
     tion for all address families, or can be restricted to a specific address
     family by specifying which one is desired.  There can be more than one
     routing socket open per system.

     Messages are formed by a header followed by a small number of sockadders
     (now variable length particularly in the ISO case), interpreted by posi-
     tion, and delimited by the new length entry in the sockaddr.  An example
     of a message with four addresses might be an ISO redirect: Destination,
     Netmask, Gateway, and Author of the redirect.  The interpretation of
     which address are present is given by a bit mask within the header, and
     the sequence is least significant to most significant bit within the vec-
     tor.

     Any messages sent to the kernel are returned, and copies are sent to all
     interested listeners.  The kernel will provide the process id. for the
     sender, and the sender may use an additional sequence field to distin-
     guish between outstanding messages.  However, message replies may be lost
     when kernel buffers are exhausted.

     The kernel may reject certain messages, and will indicate this by filling
     in the _r_t_m___e_r_r_n_o field.  The routing code returns EEXIST if requested to
     duplicate an existing entry, ESRCH if requested to delete a non-existent
     entry, or ENOBUFS if insufficient resources were available to install a
     new route.  In the current implementation, all routing process run local-
     ly, and the values for _r_t_m___e_r_r_n_o are available through the normal _e_r_r_n_o
     mechanism, even if the routing reply message is lost.

     A process may avoid the expense of reading replies to its own messages by
     issuing a setsockopt(2) call indicating that the SO_USELOOPBACK option at
     the SOL_SOCKET level is to be turned off.  A process may ignore all mes-
     sages from the routing socket by doing a shutdown(2) system call for fur-
     ther input.

     If a route is in use when it is deleted, the routing entry will be marked
     down and removed from the routing table, but the resources associated
     with it will not be reclaimed until all references to it are released.
     User processes can obtain information about the routing entry to a spe-
     cific destination by using a RTM_GET message, or by reading the _/_d_e_v_/_k_m_e_m
     device, or by issuing a getkerninfo(2) system call.
