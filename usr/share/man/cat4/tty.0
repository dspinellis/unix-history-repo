     This section describes the interface to the terminal drivers in the sys-
     tem.

     Each hardware terminal port on the system usually has a terminal special
     device file associated with it in the directory ``/dev/'' (for example,
     ``/dev/tty03'').  When a user logs into the system on one of these hard-
     ware terminal ports, the system has already opened the associated device
     and prepared the line for normal interactive use (see getty(8).)  There
     is also a special case of a terminal file that connects not to a hardware
     terminal port, but to another program on the other side.  These special
     terminal devices are called _p_t_y_s and provide the mechanism necessary to
     give users the same interface to the system when logging in over a net-
     work (using rlogin(1),  or telnet(1) for example.)  Even in these cases
     the details of how the terminal file was opened and set up is already
     handled by special software in the system.  Thus, users do not normally
     need to worry about the details of how these lines are opened or used.
     Also, these lines are often used for dialing out of a system (through an
     out-calling modem), but again the system provides programs that hide the
     details of accessing these terminal special files (see tip(2).)

     When an interactive user logs in, the system prepares the line to behave
     in a certain way (called a _l_i_n_e _d_i_s_c_i_p_l_i_n_e _)_, the particular details of
     which is described in stty(1) at the command level, and in termios(4) at
     the programming level.  A user may be concerned with changing settings
     associated with his particular login terminal and should refer to the
     preceding man pages for the common cases.  The remainder of this man page
     is concerned with describing details of using and controlling terminal
     devices at a low level, such as that possibly required by a program wish-
     ing to provide features similar to those provided by the system.

   LLiinnee ddiisscciipplliinneess
     A terminal file is used like any other file in the system in that it can
     be opened, read, and written to using standard system calls.  For each
     existing terminal file, a software processing module called a _l_i_n_e
     _d_i_s_c_i_p_l_i_n_e is associated with it.  The _l_i_n_e _d_i_s_c_i_p_l_i_n_e essentially glues
     the low level device driver code with the high level generic interface
     routines (such as read(2) and write(2)),  and is responsible for imple-
     menting the semantics associated with the device.  When a terminal file
     is first opened by a program, the default _l_i_n_e _d_i_s_c_i_p_l_i_n_e called the
     termios line discipline is associated with the file.  This is the primary
     line discipline that is used in most cases and provides the semantics
     that users normally associate with a terminal.  When the termios line
     discipline is in effect, the terminal file behaves and is operated ac-
     cording to the rules described in termios(4).  Please refer to that man
     page for a full description of the terminal semantics.  The operations
     described here generally represent features common across all _l_i_n_e
     _d_i_s_c_i_p_l_i_n_e_s however, some of these calls may not make sense in conjunc-
     tion with a line discipline other than termios, and some may not be sup-
     ported by the underlying hardware or (lack thereof, as in the case of
     ptys).

   TTeerrmmiinnaall FFiillee OOppeerraattiioonnss
     All of the following operations are invoked using the ioctl(2) system
     call.  Refer to that man page for a description of the _r_e_q_u_e_s_t and _a_r_g_p
     parameter.  In addition to the ioctl _r_e_q_u_e_s_t_s defined here, the specific
     line discipline in effect will define other _r_e_q_u_e_s_t_s specific to it (ac-
     tually termios(4) defines them as function calls, not ioctl _r_e_q_u_e_s_t_s _._)
     The following section lists the available ioctl requests.  The name of
     the request and the typed _a_r_g_p parameter (if any) is listed along with a
     description of its purpose.  For example, the first entry says

           _T_I_O_C_S_E_T_D _i_n_t _*_l_d_i_s_c

     and would be called on the terminal associated with file discriptor zero
     by the following code fragment:

             int ldisc;

             ldisc = TTYDISC;
             ioctl(0, TIOCSETD, &ldisc);

     TIOCSETD _i_n_t _*_l_d_i_s_c
                 Change to the new line discipline pointed to by _l_d_i_s_c. The
                 available line disciplines are listed in <sys/termios.h> and
                 currently are:

                 TTYDISC     Termios interactive line discipline.
                 TABLDISC    Tablet line discipline.
                 SLIPDISC    Serial IP line discipline.

     TIOCGETD _i_n_t _*_l_d_i_s_c
                 Return the current line discipline in the integer pointed to
                 by _l_d_i_s_c.

     TIOCSBRK _v_o_i_d
                 Set the terminal hardware into BREAK condition.

     TIOCCBRK _v_o_i_d
                 Clear the terminal hardware BREAK condition.

     TIOCSDTR _v_o_i_d
                 Assert data terminal ready (DTR).

     TIOCCDTR _v_o_i_d
                 Clear data terminal ready (DTR).

     TIOCGPGRP _i_n_t _*_t_p_g_r_p
                 Return the current process group the terminal is associated
                 with in the integer pointed to by _t_p_g_r_p. This is the underly-
                 ing call that implements the termios(4) ttccggeettaattttrr() call.

     TIOCSPGRP _i_n_t _*_t_p_g_r_p
                 Associate the terminal with the process group (as an integer)
                 pointed to by _t_p_g_r_p. This is the underlying call that imple-
                 ments the termios(4) ttccsseettaattttrr() call.

     TIOCGETA _s_t_r_u_c_t _t_e_r_m_i_o_s _*_t_e_r_m
                 Place the current value of the termios state associated with
                 the device in the termios structure pointed to by _t_e_r_m. This
                 is the underlying call that implements the termios(4)
                 ttccggeettaattttrr() call.

     TIOCSETA _s_t_r_u_c_t _t_e_r_m_i_o_s _*_t_e_r_m
                 Set the termios state associated with the device immediatly.
                 This is the underlying call that implements the termios(4)
                 ttccsseettaattttrr() call with the TCSANOW option.

     TIOCSETAW _s_t_r_u_c_t _t_e_r_m_i_o_s _*_t_e_r_m
                 First wait for any output to complete, then set the termios
                 state associated with the device.  This is the underlying
                 call that implements the termios(4) ttccsseettaattttrr() call with the
                 TCSADRAIN option.

     TIOCSETAF _s_t_r_u_c_t _t_e_r_m_i_o_s _*_t_e_r_m
                 First wait for any output to complete, clear any pending in-
                 put, then set the termios state associated with the device.
                 This is the underlying call that implements the termios(4)
                 ttccsseettaattttrr() call with the TCSAFLUSH option.

     TIOCOUTQ _i_n_t _*_n_u_m
                 Place the current number of characters in the output queue in
                 the integer pointed to by _n_u_m.

     TIOCSTI _c_h_a_r _*_c_p
                 Simulate typed input.  Pretend as if the terminal recieved
                 the character pointed to by _c_p.

     TIOCNOTTY _v_o_i_d
                 This call is obsolete but left for compatability.  In the
                 past, when a process that didn't have a controlling terminal
                 (see _T_h_e _C_o_n_t_r_o_l_l_i_n_g _T_e_r_m_i_n_a_l in termios(4))  first opened a
                 terminal device, it acquired that terminal as its controlling
                 terminal.  For some programs this was a hazard as they didn't
                 want a controlling terminal in the first place, and this pro-
                 vided a mechanism to disassociate the controlling terminal
                 from the calling process.  It _m_u_s_t be called by opening the
                 file _/_d_e_v_/_t_t_y and calling TIOCNOTTY on that file descriptor.

                 The current system does not allocate a controlling terminal
                 to a process on an ooppeenn() call: there is a specific ioctl
                 called TIOSCTTY to make a terminal the controlling terminal.
                 In addition, a program can ffoorrkk() and call the sseettssiidd() sys-
                 tem call which will place the process into its own session -
                 which has the effect of disassociating it from the control-
                 ling terminal.  This is the new and prefered method for pro-
                 grams to lose their controlling terminal.

     TIOCSTOP _v_o_i_d
                 Stop output on the terminal (like typing ^S at the keyboard).

     TIOCSTART _v_o_i_d
                 Start output on the terminal (like typing ^Q at the kay-
                 board).

     TIOCSCTTY _v_o_i_d
                 Make the terminal the controlling terminal for the process
                 (the process must not currently have a controlling terminal).

     TIOCDRAIN _v_o_i_d
                 Wait until all output is drained.

     TIOCEXCL _v_o_i_d
                 Set exclusive use on the terminal.  No further opens are per-
                 mitted except by root.  Of course, this means that programs
                 that are run by root (or setuid) will not obey the exclusive
                 setting - which limits the usefullness of this feature.

     TIOCNXCL _v_o_i_d
                 Clear exclusive use of the terminal.  Further opens are per-
                 mitted.

     TIOCFLUSH _i_n_t _*_w_h_a_t
                 If the value of the int pointed to by _w_h_a_t contains the FREAD
                 bit as defined in <sys/file.h>, then all characters in the
                 input queue are cleared.  If it contains the FWRITE bit, then
                 all characters in the output queue are cleared.  If the value
                 of the integer is zero, then it behaves as if both the FREAD
                 and FWRITE bits were set (i.e. clears both queues).

     TIOCGWINSZ _s_t_r_u_c_t _w_i_n_s_i_z_e _*_w_s
                 Put the window size information associated with the terminal
                 in the _w_i_n_s_i_z_e structure pointed to by _w_s. The window size
                 structure contains the number of rows and columns (and pixels
                 if appropiate) of the devices attached to the terminal.  It
                 is set by user software and is the means by which most full-
                 screen oriented programs determine the screen size.  The
                 _w_i_n_s_i_z_e structure is defined in <sys/ioctl.h>.

     TIOCSWINSZ _s_t_r_u_c_t _w_i_n_s_i_z_e _*_w_s
                 Set the window size associated with the terminal to be the
                 value in the _w_i_n_s_i_z_e structure pointed to by _w_s (see above).

     TIOCCONS _i_n_t _*_o_n
                 If _o_n points to a non-zero integer, redirect kernel console
                 output (kernel printf's) to this terminal.  If _o_n points to a
                 zero integer, redirect kernel console output back to the nor-
                 mal console.  This is usually used on workstations to redi-
                 rect kernel messages to a particular window.

     TIOCMSET _i_n_t _*_s_t_a_t_e
                 The integer pointed to by _s_t_a_t_e contains bits that correspond
                 to modem state.  Following is a list of defined variables and
                 the modem state they represent:

                 TIOCM_LE   Line Enable.
                 TIOCM_DTR  Data Terminal Ready.
                 TIOCM_RTS  Request To Send.
                 TIOCM_ST   Secondary Transmit.
                 TIOCM_SR   Secondary Recieve.
                 TIOCM_CTS  Clear To Send.
                 TIOCM_CAR  Carrier Detect.
                 TIOCM_CD   Carier Detect (synonym).
                 TIOCM_RNG  Ring Indication.
                 TIOCM_RI   Ring Indication (synonym).
                 TIOCM_DSR  Data Set Ready.

                 This call sets the terminal modem state to that represented
                 by _s_t_a_t_e. Not all terminals may support this.

     TIOCMGET _i_n_t _*_s_t_a_t_e
                 Return the current state of the terminal modem lines as rep-
                 resented above in the integer pointed to by _s_t_a_t_e.

     TIOCMBIS _i_n_t _*_s_t_a_t_e
                 The bits in the integer pointed to by _s_t_a_t_e represent modem
                 state as described above, however the state is OR-ed in with
                 the current state.

     TIOCMBIC _i_n_t _*_s_t_a_t_e
                 The bits in the integer pointed to by _s_t_a_t_e represent modem
                 state as described above, however each bit which is on in
                 _s_t_a_t_e is cleared in the terminal.
