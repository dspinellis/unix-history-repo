     hosts - host name data base

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The _h_o_s_t_s file contains information regarding the known
     hosts on the network.  For each host a single line should be
     present with the following information:

     official host name
     Internet address
     aliases

     Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab char-
     acters.  A ``#'' indicates the beginning of a comment; char-
     acters up to the end of the line are not interpreted by rou-
     tines which search the file.

     When using the name server _n_a_m_e_d(8), this file provides a
     backup when the name server is not running.  For the name
     server, it is suggested that only a few addresses be
     included in this file.  These include  address for the local
     interfaces that _i_f_c_o_n_f_i_g(8C) needs at boot time and a few
     machines on the local network.

     This file may be created from the official host data base
     maintained at the Network Information Control Center (NIC),
     though local changes may be required to bring it up to date
     regarding unofficial aliases and/or unknown hosts.  As the
     data base maintained at NIC is incomplete, use of the name
     server is recommend for sites on the DARPA Internet.

     Network addresses are specified in the conventional ``.''
     notation using the _i_n_e_t__a_d_d_r() routine from the Internet
     address manipulation library, _i_n_e_t(3N).  Host names may con-
     tain any printable character other than a field delimiter,
     newline, or comment character.
