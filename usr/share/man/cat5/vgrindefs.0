     _V_g_r_i_n_d_e_f_s contains all language definitions for vgrind.  The
     data base is very similar to _t_e_r_m_c_a_p(5).

     The following table names and describes each field.

     pb     str   regular expression for start of a procedure

     cb     str   regular expression for the start of a comment

     The following entry, which describes the C language, is typ-
     ical of a language entry.

     C|c:   :pb=^\d?*?\d?\p\d??):bb={:be=}:cb=/*:ce=*/:sb=":se=\e":\
	    :lb=':le=\e':tl:\
	    :kw=asm auto break case char continue default do double else enum\
	    extern float for fortran goto if int long register return short\
	    sizeof static struct switch typedef union unsigned while #define\
	    #else #endif #if #ifdef #ifndef #include #undef # define else endif\
	    if ifdef ifndef include undef:

     Note that the first field is just the language name (and any
     variants of it).  Thus the C language could be specified to
     _v_g_r_i_n_d(1) as "c" or "C".

     Entries may continue onto multiple lines by giving a \ as
     the last character of a line.  Capabilities in _v_g_r_i_n_d_e_f_s are
     of two types: Boolean capabilities which indicate that the
     language has some particular feature and string capabilities
     which give a regular expression or keyword list.

     _V_g_r_i_n_d_e_f_s uses regular expression which are very similar to
     those of _e_x(1) and _l_e_x(1).  The characters `^', `$', `:' and
     `\' are reserved characters and must be "quoted" with a
     preceding \ if they are to be included as normal characters.
     The metasymbols and their meanings are:

     $	  the end of a line

     ^	  the beginning of a line

     \d   a delimiter (space, tab, newline, start of line)

     \a   matches any string of symbols (like .* in lex)

     \p   matches any alphanumeric name.  In a procedure defini-
	  tion (pb) the string that matches this symbol is used
	  as the procedure name.

     ()   grouping

     |	  alternation

     ?	  last item is optional

     \e   preceding any string means that the string will not
	  match an input string if the input string is preceded
	  by an escape character (\).  This is typically used for
	  languages (like C) which can include the string delim-
	  iter in a string by escaping it.

     Unlike other regular expressions in the system,  these match
     words and not characters.	Hence something like
     "(tramp|steamer)flies?" would match "tramp", "steamer",
     "trampflies", or "steamerflies".

     The keyword list is just a list of keywords in the language
     separated by spaces.  If the "oc" boolean is specified,
     indicating that upper and lower case are equivalent, then
     all the keywords should be specified in lower case.
