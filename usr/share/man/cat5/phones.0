     pphhoonneess - remote host phone number data base

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The file _/_e_t_c_/_p_h_o_n_e_s contains the system-wide private phone numbers for
     the tip(1) program.  This file is normally unreadable, and so may contain
     privileged information.  The format of the file is a series of lines of
     the form: <system-name>[ \t]*<phone-number>.  The system name is one of
     those defined in the remote(5) file and the phone number is constructed
     from any sequence of characters terminated only by ``,'' or the end of
     the line.  The ``='' and ``*'' characters are indicators to the auto call
     units to pause and wait for a second dial tone (when going through an ex-
     change).  The ``='' is required by the DF02-AC and the ``*'' is required
     by the BIZCOMP 1030.

     Only one phone number per line is permitted.  However, if more than one
     line in the file contains the same system name tip(1) will attempt to di-
     al each one in turn, until it establishes a connection.
