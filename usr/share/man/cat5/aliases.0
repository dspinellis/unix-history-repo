     This file describes user ID aliases used by _/_u_s_r_/_s_b_i_n_/_s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l. The file
     resides in _/_e_t_c and is formatted as a series of lines of the form

           name: name_1, name2, name_3, . . .

     The _n_a_m_e is the name to alias, and the _n_a_m_e___n are the aliases for that
     name.  Lines beginning with white space are continuation lines.  Lines
     beginning with `#' are comments.

     Aliasing occurs only on local names.  Loops can not occur, since no mes-
     sage will be sent to any person more than once.

     After aliasing has been done, local and valid recipients who have a
     ``_._f_o_r_w_a_r_d'' file in their home directory have messages forwarded to the
     list of users defined in that file.

     This is only the raw data file; the actual aliasing information is placed
     into a binary format in the file _/_e_t_c_/_a_l_i_a_s_e_s_._d_b using the program
     newaliases(1).  A newaliases command should be executed each time the
     aliases file is changed for the change to take effect.

BBUUGGSS
     If you have compiled sendmail with DBM support instead of NEWDB, you may
     have encounter problems in dbm(3) restricting a single alias to about
     1000 bytes of information.  You can get longer aliases by ``chaining'';
     that is, make the last name in the alias be a dummy name which is a con-
     tinuation alias.
