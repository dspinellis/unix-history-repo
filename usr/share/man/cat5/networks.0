     nneettwwoorrkkss - network name data base

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The networks file contains information regarding the known networks which
     comprise the DARPA Internet.  For each network a single line should be
     present with the following information:

           official network name
           network number
           aliases

     Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab characters.  A
     ``#'' indicates the beginning of a comment; characters up to the end of
     the line are not interpreted by routines which search the file.  This
     file is normally created from the official network data base maintained
     at the Network Information Control Center (NIC), though local changes may
     be required to bring it up to date regarding unofficial aliases and/or
     unknown networks.

     Network number may be specified in the conventional ``.''  (dot) notation
     using the inet_network(3) routine from the Internet address manipulation
     library, inet(3).  Network names may contain any printable character oth-
     er than a field delimiter, newline, or comment character.
