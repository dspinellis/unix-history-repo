     Limits on the consumption of system resources by the current process and
     each process it creates may be obtained with the ggeettrrlliimmiitt() call, and
     set with the sseettrrlliimmiitt() call.

     The _r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e parameter is one of the following:

     RLIMIT_CORE     The largest size (in bytes) core file that may be creat-
                     ed.

     RLIMIT_CPU      The maximum amount of cpu time (in seconds) to be used by
                     each process.

     RLIMIT_DATA     The maximum size (in bytes) of the data segment for a
                     process; this defines how far a program may extend its
                     break with the sbrk(2) system call.

     RLIMIT_FSIZE    The largest size (in bytes) file that may be created.

     RLIMIT_MEMLOCK  The maximum size (in bytes) which a process may lock into
                     memory using the mlock(2) function.

     RLIMIT_NOFILE   The maximum number of open files for this process.

     RLIMIT_NPROC    The maximum number of simultaneous processes for this us-
                     er id.

     RLIMIT_RSS      The maximum size (in bytes) to which a process's resident
                     set size may grow.  This imposes a limit on the amount of
                     physical memory to be given to a process; if memory is
                     tight, the system will prefer to take memory from pro-
                     cesses that are exceeding their declared resident set
                     size.

     RLIMIT_STACK    The maximum size (in bytes) of the stack segment for a
                     process; this defines how far a program's stack segment
                     may be extended.  Stack extension is performed automati-
                     cally by the system.

     A resource limit is specified as a soft limit and a hard limit.  When a
     soft limit is exceeded a process may receive a signal (for example, if
     the cpu time or file size is exceeded), but it will be allowed to contin-
     ue execution until it reaches the hard limit (or modifies its resource
     limit).  The _r_l_i_m_i_t structure is used to specify the hard and soft limits
     on a resource,

           struct rlimit {
                   quad_t  rlim_cur;       /* current (soft) limit */
                   quad_t  rlim_max;       /* hard limit */
           };

     Only the super-user may raise the maximum limits.  Other users may only
     alter _r_l_i_m___c_u_r within the range from 0 to _r_l_i_m___m_a_x or (irreversibly) low-
     er _r_l_i_m___m_a_x.

     An ``infinite'' value for a limit is defined as RLIM_INFINITY.

     Because this information is stored in the per-process information, this
     system call must be executed directly by the shell if it is to affect all
     future processes created by the shell; lliimmiitt is thus a built-in command
     to csh(1).

     The system refuses to extend the data or stack space when the limits
     would be exceeded in the normal way: a break call fails if the data space
     limit is reached.  When the stack limit is reached, the process receives
     a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV); if this signal is not caught by a handler
     using the signal stack, this signal will kill the process.

     A file I/O operation that would create a file larger that the process'
     soft limit will cause the write to fail and a signal SIGXFSZ to be gener-
     ated; this normally terminates the process, but may be caught.  When the
     soft cpu time limit is exceeded, a signal SIGXCPU is sent to the offend-
     ing process.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEESS
     A 0 return value indicates that the call succeeded, changing or returning
     the resource limit.   A return value of -1 indicates that an error oc-
     curred, and an error code is stored in the global location _e_r_r_n_o.

EERRRROORRSS
     GGeettrrlliimmiitt() and sseettrrlliimmiitt() will fail if:

     [EFAULT]      The address specified for _r_l_p is invalid.

     [EPERM]       The limit specified to sseettrrlliimmiitt() would have raised the
                   maximum limit value, and the caller is not the super-user.

     There should be lliimmiitt and uunnlliimmiitt commands in sh(1) as well as in csh.

     The ggeettrrlliimmiitt function call appeared in 4.2BSD.
