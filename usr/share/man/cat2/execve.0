     _E_x_e_c_v_e transforms the calling process into a new process.
     The new process is constructed from an ordinary file, whose
     name is pointed to by _p_a_t_h, called the _n_e_w _p_r_o_c_e_s_s _f_i_l_e.
     This file is either an executable object file, or a file of
     data for an interpreter.  An executable object file consists
     of an identifying header, followed by pages of data
     representing the initial program (text) and initialized data
     pages.  Additional pages may be specified by the header to
     be initialized with zero data.  See _a._o_u_t(5).

     An interpreter file begins with a line of the form ``##!!
     _i_n_t_e_r_p_r_e_t_e_r [[_a_r_g]]''.  When an interpreter file is _e_x_e_c_v_e'd,
     the system _e_x_e_c_v_e's the specified _i_n_t_e_r_p_r_e_t_e_r.  If the
     optional _a_r_g is specified, it becomes the first argument to
     the _i_n_t_e_r_p_r_e_t_e_r, and the name of the originally eexxeeccvvee'd
     file becomes the second argument; otherwise, the name of the
     originally eexxeeccvvee'd file becomes the first argument.  The
     original arguments are shifted over to become the subsequent
     arguments.  The zeroth argument, normally the name of the
     eexxeeccvvee'd file, is left unchanged.

     There can be no return from a successful _e_x_e_c_v_e because the
     calling core image is lost.  This is the mechanism whereby
     different process images become active.

     The argument _a_r_g_v is a pointer to a null-terminated array of
     character pointers to null-terminated character strings.
     These strings constitute the argument list to be made avail-
     able to the new process.  By convention, at least one argu-
     ment must be present in this array, and the first element of
     this array should be the name of the executed program (i.e.,
     the last component of _p_a_t_h).

     The argument _e_n_v_p is also a pointer to a null-terminated
     array of character pointers to null-terminated strings.
     These strings pass information to the new process that is
     not directly an argument to the command (see _e_n_v_i_r_o_n(7)).

     Descriptors open in the calling process remain open in the
     new process, except for those for which the close-on-exec
     flag is set (see _c_l_o_s_e(2) and _f_c_n_t_l(2)).  Descriptors that
     remain open are unaffected by _e_x_e_c_v_e.

     Ignored signals remain ignored across an _e_x_e_c_v_e, but signals
     that are caught are reset to their default values.  Blocked
     signals remain blocked regardless of changes to the signal
     action.  The signal stack is reset to be undefined (see
     _s_i_g_v_e_c(2) for more information).

     Each process has _r_e_a_l user and group IDs and an _e_f_f_e_c_t_i_v_e
     user and group IDs.  The _r_e_a_l ID identifies the person using
     the system; the _e_f_f_e_c_t_i_v_e ID determines his access
     privileges.  _E_x_e_c_v_e changes the effective user and group ID
     to the owner of the executed file if the file has the "set-
     user-ID" or "set-group-ID" modes.	The _r_e_a_l user and group
     IDs are not affected.

     The new process also inherits the following attributes from
     the calling process:

	  process ID	      see _g_e_t_p_i_d(2)
	  parent process ID   see _g_e_t_p_p_i_d(2)
	  process group ID    see _g_e_t_p_g_r_p(2)
	  access groups       see _g_e_t_g_r_o_u_p_s(2)
	  working directory   see _c_h_d_i_r(2)
	  root directory      see _c_h_r_o_o_t(2)
	  control terminal    see _t_t_y(4)
	  resource usages     see _g_e_t_r_u_s_a_g_e(2)
	  interval timers     see _g_e_t_i_t_i_m_e_r(2)
	  resource limits     see _g_e_t_r_l_i_m_i_t(2)
	  file mode mask      see _u_m_a_s_k(2)
	  signal mask	      see _s_i_g_v_e_c(2), _s_i_g_s_e_t_m_a_s_k(2)

     When the executed program begins, it is called as follows:

	  main(argc, argv, envp)
	  int argc;
	  char **argv, **envp;

     where _a_r_g_c is the number of elements in _a_r_g_v (the ``arg
     count'') and _a_r_g_v points to the array of character pointers
     to the arguments themselves.

     _E_n_v_p is a pointer to an array of strings that constitute the
     _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t of the process.  A pointer to this array is also
     stored in the global variable ``environ''.  Each string con-
     sists of a name, an "=", and a null-terminated value.  The
     array of pointers is terminated by a null pointer.  The
     shell _s_h(1) passes an environment entry for each global
     shell variable defined when the program is called.  See
     _e_n_v_i_r_o_n(7) for some conventionally used names.

     _E_x_e_c_v_e will fail and return to the calling process if one or
     more of the following are true:

     [ENOTDIR]	    A component of the path prefix is not a
		    directory.

     [EINVAL]	    The pathname contains a character with the
		    high-order bit set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG] A component of a pathname exceeded 255 char-
		    acters, or an entire path name exceeded 1023
		    characters.

     [ENOENT]	    The new process file does not exist.

     [ELOOP]	    Too many symbolic links were encountered in
		    translating the pathname.

     [EACCES]	    Search permission is denied for a component
		    of the path prefix.

     [EACCES]	    The new process file is not an ordinary file.

     [EACCES]	    The new process file mode denies execute per-
		    mission.

     [ENOEXEC]	    The new process file has the appropriate
		    access permission, but has an invalid magic
		    number in its header.

     [ETXTBSY]	    The new process file is a pure procedure
		    (shared text) file that is currently open for
		    writing or reading by some process.

     [ENOMEM]	    The new process requires more virtual memory
		    than is allowed by the imposed maximum
		    (_g_e_t_r_l_i_m_i_t(2)).

     [E2BIG]	    The number of bytes in the new process's
		    argument list is larger than the system-
		    imposed limit.  The limit in the system as
		    released is 20480 bytes (NCARGS in
		    <_s_y_s/_p_a_r_a_m._h>.

     [EFAULT]	    The new process file is not as long as indi-
		    cated by the size values in its header.

     [EFAULT]	    _P_a_t_h, _a_r_g_v, or _e_n_v_p point to an illegal
		    address.

     If a program is _s_e_t_u_i_d to a non-super-user, but is executed
     when the real _u_i_d is ``root'', then the program has some of
     the powers of a super-user as well.
