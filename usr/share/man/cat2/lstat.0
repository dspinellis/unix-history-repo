     The ssttaatt() function obtains information about the file pointed to by
     _p_a_t_h. Read, write or execute permission of the named file is not re-
     quired, but all directories listed in the path name leading to the file
     must be searchable.

     LLssttaatt() is like ssttaatt() except in the case where the named file is a sym-
     bolic link, in which case llssttaatt() returns information about the link,
     while ssttaatt() returns information about the file the link references.  Un-
     like other filesystem objects, symbolic links do not have an owner,
     group, access mode, times, etc.  Instead, these attributes are taken from
     the directory that contains the link.  The only attributes returned from
     an llssttaatt() that refer to the symbolic link itself are the file type
     (S_IFLNK), size, blocks, and link count (always 1).

     The ffssttaatt() obtains the same information about an open file known by the
     file descriptor _f_d.

     The _s_b argument is a pointer to a ssttaatt() structure as defined by
     <_s_y_s_/_s_t_a_t_._h> (shown below) and into which information is placed concern-
     ing the file.

     struct stat {
         dev_t    st_dev;    /* device inode resides on */
         ino_t    st_ino;    /* inode's number */
         mode_t   st_mode;   /* inode protection mode */
         nlink_t  st_nlink;  /* number or hard links to the file */
         uid_t    st_uid;    /* user-id of owner */
         gid_t    st_gid;    /* group-id of owner */
         dev_t    st_rdev;   /* device type, for special file inode */
         struct timespec st_atimespec;  /* time of last access */
         struct timespec st_mtimespec;  /* time of last data modification */
         struct timespec st_ctimespec;  /* time of last file status change */
         off_t    st_size;   /* file size, in bytes */
         quad_t   st_blocks; /* blocks allocated for file */
         u_long   st_blksize;/* optimal file sys I/O ops blocksize */
         u_long   st_flags;  /* user defined flags for file */
         u_long   st_gen;    /* file generation number */
     };

     The time-related fields of _s_t_r_u_c_t _s_t_a_t are as follows:

     st_atime     Time when file data last accessed.  Changed by the mknod(2),
                   utimes(2) and read(2) system calls.

     st_mtime     Time when file data last modified.  Changed by the mknod(2),

                   utimes(2) and write(2) system calls.

     st_ctime     Time when file status was last changed (inode data modifica-
                  tion).  Changed by the chmod(2),  chown(2),  link(2),
                  mknod(2),  rename(2),  unlink(2),  utimes(2) and write(2)
                  system calls.

     The size-related fields of the _s_t_r_u_c_t _s_t_a_t are as follows:

     st_blksize     The optimal I/O block size for the file.

     st_blocks      The actual number of blocks allocated for the file in
                    512-byte units.  As short symbolic links are stored in the
                    inode, this number may be zero.

     The status information word _s_t___m_o_d_e has the following bits:

     #define S_IFMT 0170000           /* type of file */
     #define        S_IFIFO  0010000  /* named pipe (fifo) */
     #define        S_IFCHR  0020000  /* character special */
     #define        S_IFDIR  0040000  /* directory */
     #define        S_IFBLK  0060000  /* block special */
     #define        S_IFREG  0100000  /* regular */
     #define        S_IFLNK  0120000  /* symbolic link */
     #define        S_IFSOCK 0140000  /* socket */
     #define S_ISUID 0004000  /* set user id on execution */
     #define S_ISGID 0002000  /* set group id on execution */
     #define S_ISVTX 0001000  /* save swapped text even after use */
     #define S_IRUSR 0000400  /* read permission, owner */
     #define S_IWUSR 0000200  /* write permission, owner */
     #define S_IXUSR 0000100  /* execute/search permission, owner */

     Upon successful completion a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the error.

     Previous versions of the system used different types for the st_dev,
     st_uid, st_gid, st_rdev, st_size, st_blksize and st_blocks fields.

     Applying fstat to a socket (and thus to a pipe) returns a zero'd buffer,
     except for the blocksize field, and a unique device and inode number.

     The ssttaatt() and ffssttaatt() function calls are expected to conform to IEEE Std
