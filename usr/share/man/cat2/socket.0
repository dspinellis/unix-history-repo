     SSoocckkeett() creates an endpoint for communication and returns a descriptor.

     The _d_o_m_a_i_n parameter specifies a communications domain within which com-
     munication will take place; this selects the protocol family which should
     be used.  These families are defined in the include file <_s_y_s_/_s_o_c_k_e_t_._h>.
     The currently understood formats are

           AF_UNIX         (UNIX internal protocols),
           AF_INET         (ARPA Internet protocols),
           AF_ISO          (ISO protocols),
           AF_NS           (Xerox Network Systems protocols), and
           AF_IMPLINK      (IMP host at IMP link layer).

     The socket has the indicated _t_y_p_e, which specifies the semantics of com-
     munication.  Currently defined types are:

           SOCK_STREAM
           SOCK_DGRAM
           SOCK_RAW
           SOCK_SEQPACKET
           SOCK_RDM

     A SOCK_STREAM type provides sequenced, reliable, two-way connection based
     byte streams.  An out-of-band data transmission mechanism may be support-
     ed.  A SOCK_DGRAM socket supports datagrams (connectionless, unreliable
     messages of a fixed (typically small) maximum length).  A SOCK_SEQPACKET
     socket may provide a sequenced, reliable, two-way connection-based data
     transmission path for datagrams of fixed maximum length; a consumer may
     be required to read an entire packet with each read system call.  This
     facility is protocol specific, and presently implemented only for PF_NS.
     SOCK_RAW sockets provide access to internal network protocols and inter-
     faces.  The types SOCK_RAW, which is available only to the super-user,
     and SOCK_RDM, which is planned, but not yet implemented, are not de-
     scribed here.

     The _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l specifies a particular protocol to be used with the socket.
     Normally only a single protocol exists to support a particular socket
     type within a given protocol family.  However, it is possible that many
     protocols may exist, in which case a particular protocol must be speci-
     fied in this manner.  The protocol number to use is particular to the
     communication domain in which communication is to take place; see
     protocols(5).

     Sockets of type SOCK_STREAM are full-duplex byte streams, similar to
     pipes.  A stream socket must be in a _c_o_n_n_e_c_t_e_d state before any data may
     be sent or received on it.  A connection to another socket is created
     with a connect(2) call.  Once connected, data may be transferred using
     read(2) and write(2) calls or some variant of the send(2) and recv(2)
     calls.  When a session has been completed a close(2) may be performed.
     Out-of-band data may also be transmitted as described in send(2) and re-
     ceived as described in recv(2).


     The communications protocols used to implement a SOCK_STREAM insure that
     data is not lost or duplicated.  If a piece of data for which the peer
     protocol has buffer space cannot be successfully transmitted within a
     reasonable length of time, then the connection is considered broken and
     calls will indicate an error with -1 returns and with ETIMEDOUT as the
     specific code in the global variable _e_r_r_n_o. The protocols optionally keep
     sockets ``warm'' by forcing transmissions roughly every minute in the ab-
     sence of other activity.  An error is then indicated if no response can
     be elicited on an otherwise idle connection for a extended period (e.g. 5
     minutes).  A SIGPIPE signal is raised if a process sends on a broken
     stream; this causes naive processes, which do not handle the signal, to
     exit.

     SOCK_SEQPACKET sockets employ the same system calls as SOCK_STREAM sock-
     ets.  The only difference is that read(2) calls will return only the
     amount of data requested, and any remaining in the arriving packet will
     be discarded.

     SOCK_DGRAM and SOCK_RAW sockets allow sending of datagrams to correspon-
     dents named in send(2) calls.  Datagrams are generally received with
     recvfrom(2),  which returns the next datagram with its return address.

     An fcntl(2) call can be used to specify a process group to receive a
     SIGURG signal when the out-of-band data arrives.  It may also enable non-
     blocking I/O and asynchronous notification of I/O events via SIGIO.

     The operation of sockets is controlled by socket level _o_p_t_i_o_n_s. These op-
     tions are defined in the file <_s_y_s_/_s_o_c_k_e_t_._h>. Setsockopt(2) and getsock-
     opt(2) are used to set and get options, respectively.

     A -1 is returned if an error occurs, otherwise the return value is a de-
     scriptor referencing the socket.

     The ssoocckkeett() call fails if:

     [EPROTONOSUPPORT]  The protocol type or the specified protocol is not
                        supported within this domain.

     [EMFILE]           The per-process descriptor table is full.

     [ENFILE]           The system file table is full.

     [EACCESS]          Permission to create a socket of the specified type
                        and/or protocol is denied.

     [ENOBUFS]          Insufficient buffer space is available.  The socket
                        cannot be created until sufficient resources are
                        freed.
