     The cclloossee() call deletes a descriptor from the per-process object refer-
     ence table.  If this is the last reference to the underlying object, the
     object will be deactivated.  For example, on the last close of a file the
     current _s_e_e_k pointer associated with the file is lost; on the last close
     of a socket(2) associated naming information and queued data are discard-
     ed; on the last close of a file holding an advisory lock the lock is re-
     leased (see further flock(2)).

     When a process exits, all associated file descriptors are freed, but
     since there is a limit on active descriptors per processes, the cclloossee()
     function call is useful when a large quanitity of file descriptors are
     being handled.

     When a process forks (see fork(2)),  all descriptors for the new child
     process reference the same objects as they did in the parent before the
     fork.  If a new process is then to be run using execve(2),  the process
     would normally inherit these descriptors.  Most of the descriptors can be
     rearranged with dup2(2) or deleted with cclloossee() before the execve is at-
     tempted, but if some of these descriptors will still be needed if the ex-
     ecve fails, it is necessary to arrange for them to be closed if the ex-
     ecve succeeds.  For this reason, the call ``fcntl(d, F_SETFD, 1)'' is
     provided, which arranges that a descriptor will be closed after a suc-
     cessful execve; the call ``fcntl(d, F_SETFD, 0)'' restores the default,
     which is to not close the descriptor.

     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and the global integer variable _e_r_r_n_o is set to indi-
     cate the error.

     CClloossee() will fail if:

     [EBADF]       _D is not an active descriptor.

     [EINTR]       An interupt was received.
