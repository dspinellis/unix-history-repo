     The file whose name is given by _p_a_t_h or referenced by the
     descriptor _f_d has its mode changed to _m_o_d_e.  Modes are con-
     structed by _o_r'ing together some combination of the follow-
     ing, defined in <_s_y_s/_i_n_o_d_e._h>:

	  ISUID   04000   set user ID on execution
	  ISGID   02000   set group ID on execution
	  ISVTX   01000   `sticky bit' (see below)
	  IREAD   00400   read by owner
	  IWRITE  00200   write by owner
	  IEXEC   00100   execute (search on directory) by owner
		  00070   read, write, execute (search) by group
		  00007   read, write, execute (search) by others

     If an executable file is set up for sharing (this is the
     default) then mode ISVTX (the `sticky bit') prevents the
     system from abandoning the swap-space image of the program-
     text portion of the file when its last user terminates.
     Ability to set this bit on executable files is restricted to
     the super-user.

     If mode ISVTX (the `sticky bit') is set on a directory, an
     unprivileged user may not delete or rename files of other
     users in that directory.  For more details of the properties
     of the sticky bit, see _s_t_i_c_k_y(8).

     Only the owner of a file (or the super-user) may change the
     mode.

     Writing or changing the owner of a file turns off the set-
     user-id and set-group-id bits unless the user is the super-
     user.  This makes the system somewhat more secure by pro-
     tecting set-user-id (set-group-id) files from remaining
     set-user-id (set-group-id) if they are modified, at the
     expense of a degree of compatibility.

     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Oth-
     erwise, a value of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indi-
     cate the error.
