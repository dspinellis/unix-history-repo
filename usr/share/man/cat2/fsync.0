     FFssyynncc() causes all modified data and attributes of _f_d to be moved to a
     permanent storage device.  This normally results in all in-core modified
     copies of buffers for the associated file to be written to a disk.

     FFssyynncc() should be used by programs that require a file to be in a known
     state, for example, in building a simple transaction facility.

     A 0 value is returned on success.  A -1 value indicates an error.

     The ffssyynncc() fails if:

     [EBADF]       _F_d is not a valid descriptor.

     [EINVAL]      _F_d refers to a socket, not to a file.

     [EIO]         An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
                   file system.
