     The pprrooffiill() function enables or disables program counter profiling of
     the current process.  If profiling is enabled, then at every clock tick,
     the kernel updates an appropriate count in the _s_a_m_p_l_e_s buffer.

     The buffer _s_a_m_p_l_e_s contains _s_i_z_e bytes and is divided into a series of
     16-bit bins.  Each bin counts the number of times the program counter was
     in a particular address range in the process when a clock tick occurred
     while profiling was enabled.  For a given program counter address, the
     number of the corresponding bin is given by the relation:

           [(pc - offset) / 2] * scale / 65536

     The _o_f_f_s_e_t parameter is the lowest address at which the kernel takes pro-
     gram counter samples.  The _s_c_a_l_e parameter ranges from 1 to 65536 and can
     be used to change the span of the bins.  A scale of 65536 maps each bin
     to 2 bytes of address range; a scale of 32768 gives 4 bytes, 16384 gives
     8 bytes and so on.  Intermediate values provide approximate intermediate
     ranges.  A _s_c_a_l_e value of 0 disables profiling.

     If the _s_c_a_l_e value is nonzero and the buffer _s_a_m_p_l_e_s contains an illegal
     address, pprrooffiill() returns -1, profiling is terminated and _e_r_r_n_o is set
     appropriately.  Otherwise pprrooffiill() returns 0.

     This routine should be named pprrooffiillee().

     The _s_a_m_p_l_e_s argument should really be a vector of type _u_n_s_i_g_n_e_d _s_h_o_r_t.

     The format of the gmon.out file is undocumented.
