     The uunnlliinnkk() function removes the link named by _p_a_t_h from its directory
     and decrements the link count of the file which was referenced by the
     link.  If that decrement reduces the link count of the file to zero, and
     no process has the file open, then all resources associated with the file
     are reclaimed.  If one or more process have the file open when the last
     link is removed, the link is removed, but the removal of the file is de-
     layed until all references to it have been closed.

     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the error.

     The uunnlliinnkk() succeeds unless:

     [ENOTDIR]       A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

     [EINVAL]        The pathname contains a character with the high-order bit
                     set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]  A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an
                     entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.

     [ENOENT]        The named file does not exist.

     [EACCES]        Search permission is denied for a component of the path
                     prefix.

     [EACCES]        Write permission is denied on the directory containing
                     the link to be removed.

     [ELOOP]         Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating
                     the pathname.

     [EPERM]         The named file is a directory and the effective user ID
                     of the process is not the super-user.

     [EPERM]         The directory containing the file is marked sticky, and
                     neither the containing directory nor the file to be re-
                     moved are owned by the effective user ID.

     [EBUSY]         The entry to be unlinked is the mount point for a mounted
                     file system.

     [EIO]           An I/O error occurred while deleting the directory entry
                     or deallocating the inode.

     [EROFS]         The named file resides on a read-only file system.

     [EFAULT]        _P_a_t_h points outside the process's allocated address
                     space.
