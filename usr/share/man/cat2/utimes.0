     The uuttiimmeess() function sets the access and modification times of the named
     file from the structures in the argument array _t_i_m_e_s.

     The first structure is the access time, and the second is the modifica-
     tion time.

     If the times are specified (the _t_i_m_e_s argument is non-NULL) the caller
     must be the owner of the file or be the super-user.

     If the times are not specified (the _t_i_m_e_s argument is NULL) the caller
     must be the owner of the file, have permission to write the file, or be
     the super-user.

     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the error.

     UUttiimmeess() will fail if:

     [EACCES]      Search permission is denied for a component of the path
                   prefix; or the _t_i_m_e_s argument is NULL and the effective us-
                   er ID of the process does not match the owner of the file,
                   and is not the super-user, and write access is denied.

     [EFAULT]      File or _t_i_m_e_s points outside the process's allocated ad-
                   dress space.

     [EINVAL]      The pathname contains a character with the high-order bit
                   set.

     [EIO]         An I/O error occurred while reading or writing the affected
                   inode.

     [ELOOP]       Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the
                   pathname.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]
                   A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an
                   entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.

     [ENOENT]      The named file does not exist.

     [ENOTDIR]     A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

     [EPERM]       The _t_i_m_e_s argument is not NULL and the calling process's
                   effective user ID does not match the owner of the file and
                   is not the super-user.

     [EROFS]       The file system containing the file is mounted read-only.
