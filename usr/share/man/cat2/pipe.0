     The ppiippee() function creates a _p_i_p_e, which is an object allowing unidirec-
     tional data flow, and allocates a pair of file descriptors.  The first
     descriptor connects to the _r_e_a_d _e_n_d of the pipe, and the second connects
     to the _w_r_i_t_e _e_n_d, so that data written to _f_i_l_d_e_s_[_1_] appears on (i.e., can
     be read from) _f_i_l_d_e_s_[_0_]. This allows the output of one program to be sent
     to another program: the source's standard output is set up to be the
     write end of the pipe, and the sink's standard input is set up to be the
     read end of the pipe.  The pipe itself persists until all its associated
     descriptors are closed.

     A pipe whose read or write end has been closed is considered _w_i_d_o_w_e_d.
     Writing on such a pipe causes the writing process to receive a SIGPIPE
     signal.  Widowing a pipe is the only way to deliver end-of-file to a
     reader: after the reader consumes any buffered data, reading a widowed
     pipe returns a zero count.

     Pipes are really a special case of the socketpair(2) call and, in fact,
     are implemented as such in the system.

     On successful creation of the pipe, zero is returned. Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and the variable _e_r_r_n_o set to indicate the error.

     The ppiippee() call will fail if:

     [EMFILE]  Too many descriptors are active.

     [ENFILE]  The system file table is full.

     [EFAULT]  The _f_i_l_d_e_s buffer is in an invalid area of the process's ad-
               dress space.
