     The real and effective group ID's of the current process are set to the
     arguments.  Unprivileged users may change the real group ID to the effec-
     tive group ID and vice-versa; only the super-user may make other changes.

     Supplying a value of -1 for either the real or effective group ID forces
     the system to substitute the current ID in place of the -1 parameter.

     The sseettrreeggiidd() function was intended to allow swapping the real and ef-
     fective group IDs in set-group-ID programs to temporarily relinquish the
     set-group-ID value.  This function did not work correctly, and its pur-
     pose is now better served by the use of the sseetteeggiidd() function (see
     setuid(2)).

     When setting the real and effective group IDs to the same value, the
     standard sseettggiidd() function is preferred.

     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the error.

     [EPERM]  The current process is not the super-user and a change other
              than changing the effective group-id to the real group-id was
              specified.
