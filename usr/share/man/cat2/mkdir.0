     The directory _p_a_t_h is created with the access permissions specified by
     _m_o_d_e and restricted by the the umask(2) of the calling process.

     The directory's owner ID is set to the process's effective user ID.  The
     directory's group ID is set to that of the parent directory in which it
     is created.

     A 0 return value indicates success.  A -1 return value indicates an er-

     MMkkddiirr() will fail and no directory will be created if:

     [ENOTDIR]   A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

     [EINVAL]    The pathname contains a character with the high-order bit
                 set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]
                 A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an en-
                 tire path name exceeded 1023 characters.

     [ENOENT]    A component of the path prefix does not exist.

     [EACCES]    Search permission is denied for a component of the path pre-
                 fix.

     [ELOOP]     Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the
                 pathname.

     [EPERM]     The _p_a_t_h argument contains a byte with the high-order bit
                 set.

     [EROFS]     The named file resides on a read-only file system.

     [EEXIST]    The named file exists.

     [ENOSPC]    The directory in which the entry for the new directory is be-
                 ing placed cannot be extended because there is no space left
                 on the file system containing the directory.

     [ENOSPC]    The new directory cannot be created because there there is no
                 space left on the file system that will contain the directo-
                 ry.

     [ENOSPC]    There are no free inodes on the file system on which the di-
                 rectory is being created.

     [EDQUOT]    The directory in which the entry for the new directory is be-
                 ing placed cannot be extended because the user's quota of
                 disk blocks on the file system containing the directory has

                 been exhausted.

     [EDQUOT]    The new directory cannot be created because the user's quota
                 of disk blocks on the file system that will contain the di-
                 rectory has been exhausted.

     [EDQUOT]    The user's quota of inodes on the file system on which the
                 directory is being created has been exhausted.

     [EIO]       An I/O error occurred while making the directory entry or al-
                 locating the inode.

     [EIO]       An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
                 file system.

     [EFAULT]    _P_a_t_h points outside the process's allocated address space.
