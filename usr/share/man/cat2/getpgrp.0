     The process group of the current process is returned by ggeettppggrrpp().

     Process groups are used for distribution of signals, and by terminals to
     arbitrate requests for their input: processes that have the same process
     group as the terminal are foreground and may read, while others will
     block with a signal if they attempt to read.

     This call is thus used by programs such as csh(1) to create process
     groups in implementing job control.  The ttccggeettppggrrpp() and ttccsseettppggrrpp()
     calls are used to get/set the process group of the control terminal.

     The ggeettppggrrpp function call appeared in 4.0BSD.

     The ggeettppggrrpp() function conforms to IEEE Std 1003.1-1988 (``POSIX'').

     This version of ggeettppggrrpp() differs from past Berkeley versions by not tak-
     ing a _p_i_d___t _p_i_d argument.  This incompatibility is required by IEEE
     Std1003.1-1988 (``POSIX'').

     From the IEEE Std1003.1-1988 (``POSIX'') Rationale:

     4.3BSD provides a ggeettppggrrpp() function that returns the process group ID
     for a specified process.  Although this function is used to support job
     control, all known job-control shells always specify the calling process
     with this function.  Thus, the simpler System V ggeettppggrrpp() suffices, and
     the added complexity of the 4.3BSD ggeettppggrrpp() has been omitted from
     POSIX.1.
