     The system defines a set of signals that may be delivered to a process.
     Signal delivery resembles the occurrence of a hardware interrupt: the
     signal is blocked from further occurrence, the current process context is
     saved, and a new one is built.  A process may specify a _h_a_n_d_l_e_r to which
     a signal is delivered, or specify that a signal is to be _i_g_n_o_r_e_d. A pro-
     cess may also specify that a default action is to be taken by the system
     when a signal occurs.  A signal may also be _b_l_o_c_k_e_d, in which case its
     delivery is postponed until it is _u_n_b_l_o_c_k_e_d. The action to be taken on
     delivery is determined at the time of delivery.  Normally, signal han-
     dlers execute on the current stack of the process.  This may be changed,
     on a per-handler basis, so that signals are taken on a special _s_i_g_n_a_l
     _s_t_a_c_k.

     Signal routines execute with the signal that caused their invocation
     _b_l_o_c_k_e_d, but other signals may yet occur.  A global _s_i_g_n_a_l _m_a_s_k defines
     the set of signals currently blocked from delivery to a process.  The
     signal mask for a process is initialized from that of its parent (normal-
     ly empty).  It may be changed with a sigprocmask(2) call, or when a sig-
     nal is delivered to the process.

     When a signal condition arises for a process, the signal is added to a
     set of signals pending for the process.  If the signal is not currently
     _b_l_o_c_k_e_d by the process then it is delivered to the process.  Signals may
     be delivered any time a process enters the operating system (e.g., during
     a system call, page fault or trap, or clock interrupt).  If multiple sig-
     nals are ready to be delivered at the same time, any signals that could
     be caused by traps are delivered first.  Additional signals may be pro-
     cessed at the same time, with each appearing to interrupt the handlers
     for the previous signals before their first instructions.  The set of
     pending signals is returned by the sigpending(2) function.  When a caught
     signal is delivered, the current state of the process is saved, a new
     signal mask is calculated (as described below), and the signal handler is
     invoked.  The call to the handler is arranged so that if the signal han-
     dling routine returns normally the process will resume execution in the
     context from before the signal's delivery.  If the process wishes to re-
     sume in a different context, then it must arrange to restore the previous
     context itself.

     When a signal is delivered to a process a new signal mask is installed
     for the duration of the process' signal handler (or until a sigprocmask
     call is made).  This mask is formed by taking the union of the current
     signal mask set, the signal to be delivered, and the signal mask associ-
     ated with the handler to be invoked.

     SSiiggaaccttiioonn() assigns an action for a specific signal.  If _a_c_t is non-zero,
     it specifies an action (SIG_DFL, SIG_IGN, or a handler routine) and mask
     to be used when delivering the specified signal.  If _o_a_c_t is non-zero,
     the previous handling information for the signal is returned to the user.


     Once a signal handler is installed, it remains installed until another
     ssiiggaaccttiioonn() call is made, or an execve(2) is performed.  A signal-
     specific default action may be reset by setting _s_a___h_a_n_d_l_e_r to SIG_DFL.
     The defaults are process termination, possibly with core dump; no action;
     stopping the process; or continuing the process.  See the signal list be-
     low for each signal's default action.  If _s_a___h_a_n_d_l_e_r is SIG_DFL, the de-
     fault action for the signal is to discard the signal, and if a signal is
     pending, the pending signal is discarded even if the signal is masked.
     If _s_a___h_a_n_d_l_e_r is set to SIG_IGN current and pending instances of the sig-
     nal are ignored and discarded.

     Options may be specified by setting _s_a___f_l_a_g_s. If the SA_NOCLDSTOP bit is
     set when installing a catching function for the SIGCHLD signal, the
     SIGCHLD signal will be generated only when a child process exits, not
     when a child process stops.  Further, if the SA_ONSTACK bit is set in
     _s_a___f_l_a_g_s, the system will deliver the signal to the process on a _s_i_g_n_a_l
     _s_t_a_c_k, specified with sigstack(2).

     If a signal is caught during the system calls listed below, the call may
     be forced to terminate with the error EINTR, the call may return with a
     data transfer shorter than requested, or the call may be restarted.
     Restart of pending calls is requested by setting the SA_RESTART bit in
     _s_a___f_l_a_g_s. The affected system calls include open(2),  read(2),  write(2),
      sendto(2),  recvfrom(2),  sendmsg(2) and recvmsg(2) on a communications
     channel or a slow device (such as a terminal, but not a regular file) and
     during a wait(2) or ioctl(2).  However, calls that have already committed
     are not restarted, but instead return a partial success (for example, a
     short read count).

     After a fork(2) or vfork(2) all signals, the signal mask, the signal
     stack, and the restart/interrupt flags are inherited by the child.

     Execve(2) reinstates the default action for all signals which were caught
     and resets all signals to be caught on the user stack.  Ignored signals
     remain ignored; the signal mask remains the same; signals that restart
     pending system calls continue to do so.

     The mask specified in _a_c_t is not allowed to block SIGKILL or SIGSTOP.
     This is done silently by the system.

     A 0 value indicated that the call succeeded.  A -1 return value indicates
     an error occurred and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicated the reason.

     The handler routine can be declared:

           void handler(sig, code, scp)
           int sig, code;
           struct sigcontext *scp;

     Here _s_i_g is the signal number, into which the hardware faults and traps
     are mapped.  _C_o_d_e is a parameter that is either a constant or the code
     provided by the hardware.  _S_c_p is a pointer to the _s_i_g_c_o_n_t_e_x_t structure
     (defined in <_s_i_g_n_a_l_._h>), used to restore the context from before the sig-
     nal.

EERRRROORRSS
     SSiiggaaccttiioonn() will fail and no new signal handler will be installed if one
     of the following occurs:

     [EFAULT]      Either _a_c_t or _o_a_c_t points to memory that is not a valid
                   part of the process address space.

     [EINVAL]      _S_i_g is not a valid signal number.

     [EINVAL]      An attempt is made to ignore or supply a handler for
                   SIGKILL or SIGSTOP.

     The ssiiggaaccttiioonn function is defined by IEEE Std1003.1-1988 (``POSIX''). The
     SA_ONSTACK and SA_RESTART flags are Berkeley extensions, as are the sig-
     nals, SIGTRAP, SIGEMT, SIGBUS, SIGSYS, SIGURG, SIGIO, SIGXCPU, SIGXFSZ,
     SIGVTALRM, SIGPROF, SIGWINCH, and SIGINFO. Those signals are available on
     most BSD-derived systems.
