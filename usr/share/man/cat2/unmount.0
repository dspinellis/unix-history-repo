     The mmoouunntt() function grafts a filesystem object onto the system file tree
     at the point _d_i_r. The argument _d_a_t_a describes the filesystem object to be
     mounted.  The argument _t_y_p_e tells the kernel how to interpret _d_a_t_a (See
     _t_y_p_e below).  The contents of the filesystem become available through the
     new mount point _d_i_r. Any files in _d_i_r at the time of a successful mount
     are swept under the carpet so to speak, and are unavailable until the
     filesystem is unmounted.

     The following _f_l_a_g_s may be specified to suppress default semantics which
     affect filesystem access.

     MNT_RDONLY       The filesystem should be treated as read-only; Even the
                      super-user may not write on it.

     MNT_NOEXEC       Do not allow files to be executed from the filesystem.

     MNT_NOSUID       Do not honor setuid or setgid bits on files when execut-
                      ing them.

     MNT_NODEV        Do not interpret special files on the filesystem.

     MNT_SYNCHRONOUS  All I/O to the filesystem should be done synchronously.

     The flag MNT_UPDATE indicates that the mount command is being applied to
     an already mounted filesystem.  This allows the mount flags to be changed
     without requiring that the filesystem be unmounted and remounted.  Some
     filesystems may not allow all flags to be changed.  For example, most
     filesystems will not allow a change from read-write to read-only.

     The _t_y_p_e argument defines the type of the filesystem.  The types of
     filesystems known to the system are defined in <_s_y_s_/_m_o_u_n_t_._h>. _D_a_t_a is a
     pointer to a structure that contains the type specific arguments to
     mount.  The currently supported types of filesystems and their type spe-
     cific data are:

     MOUNT_UFS
           struct ufs_args {
                 char      *fspec;  /* Block special file to mount */
                 int       exflags; /* export related flags */
                 uid_t     exroot;  /* mapping for root uid */
           };

     MOUNT_NFS
           struct nfs_args {
                 struct sockaddr_in *addr; /* file server address */
                 nfsv2fh_t *fh;       /* File handle to be mounted */
                 int       flags;     /* flags */
                 int       wsize;     /* write size in bytes */
                 int       rsize;     /* read size in bytes */
                 int       timeo;     /* initial timeout 0.1 secs */
                 int       retrans;   /* times to retry send */
                 char      *hostname; /* server's name */
           };

     MOUNT_MFS
           struct mfs_args {
                 char      *name;  /* name of backing process */
                 caddr_t   base;   /* base address of the filesystem */
                 u_long    size;   /* size of the filesystem */
           };

     The uummoouunntt() function call disassociates the filesystem from the speci-
     fied mount point _d_i_r.

     The _f_l_a_g_s argument may specify MNT_FORCE to specify that the filesystem
     should be forcibly unmounted even if files are still active.  Active spe-
     cial devices continue to work, but any further accesses to any other ac-
     tive files result in errors even if the filesystem is later remounted.

     The mmoouunntt() returns the value 0 if the mount was successful, otherwise -1
     is returned and the variable _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the error.

     UUmmoouunntt returns the value 0 if the umount succeeded; otherwise -1 is re-
     turned and the variable _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the error.

                filesystem.

                tion.

     [EFAULT]   _D_i_r points outside the process's allocated address space.
