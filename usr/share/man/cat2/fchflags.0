     The file whose name is given by _p_a_t_h or referenced by the descriptor _f_d
     has its flags changed to _f_l_a_g_s.

     The flags specified are formed by _o_r'ing the following values

           UF_NODUMP     Do not dump the file.
           UF_IMMUTABLE  The file may not be changed.
           UF_APPEND     The file may only be appended to.
           SF_IMMUTABLE  The file may not be changed.
           SF_APPEND     The file may only be appended to.

     The ``UF_IMMUTABLE'' and ``UF_APPEND'' flags may be set or unset by ei-
     ther the owner of a file or the super-user.

     The ``SF_IMMUTABLE'' and ``SF_APPEND'' flags may only be set or unset by
     the super-user.  They may be set at any time, but normally may only be
     unset when the system is in single-user mode.  (See init(8) for details.)

     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, -1 is
     returned and the global variable _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the error.

     CChhffllaaggss() will fail it:

     [ENOTDIR]     A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

     [EINVAL]      The pathname contains a character with the high-order bit
                   set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]
                   A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an
                   entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.

     [ENOENT]      The named file does not exist.

     [EACCES]      Search permission is denied for a component of the path
                   prefix.

     [ELOOP]       Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the
                   pathname.

     [EPERM]       The effective user ID does not match the owner of the file
                   and the effective user ID is not the super-user.

     [EROFS]       The named file resides on a read-only file system.

     [EFAULT]      _P_a_t_h points outside the process's allocated address space.


     [EIO]         An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
                   file system.

     FFcchhffllaaggss() will fail if:

     [EBADF]       The descriptor is not valid.

     [EINVAL]      _F_d refers to a socket, not to a file.

     [EPERM]       The effective user ID does not match the owner of the file
                   and the effective user ID is not the super-user.

     [EROFS]       The file resides on a read-only file system.

     [EIO]         An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
                   file system.
