DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     TTiipp and _c_u establish a full-duplex connection to another machine, giving
     the appearance of being logged in directly on the remote cpu.  It goes
     without saying that you must have a login on the machine (or equivalent)
     to which you wish to connect.  The preferred interface is ttiipp.  The _c_u
     interface is included for those people attached to the ``call UNIX'' com-
     mand of version 7.  This manual page describes only ttiipp.

     Available Option:

     --vv    Set verbose mode.

     Typed characters are normally transmitted directly to the remote machine
     (which does the echoing as well).	A tilde (`~') appearing as the first
     character of a line is an escape signal; the following are recognized:

     ~~^^DD ~~.
	   Drop the connection and exit (you may still be logged in on the re-
	   mote machine).

     ~~cc [_n_a_m_e]
	   Change directory to _n_a_m_e (no argument implies change to your home
	   directory).

     ~~!!    Escape to a shell (exiting the shell will return you to tip).

     ~~>>    Copy file from local to remote.  TTiipp prompts for the name of a lo-
	   cal file to transmit.

     ~~<<    Copy file from remote to local.  TTiipp prompts first for the name of
	   the file to be sent, then for a command to be executed on the re-
	   mote machine.

     ~~pp _f_r_o_m [_t_o]
	   Send a file to a remote UNIX host.  The put command causes the
	   remote UNIX system to run the command string ``cat > 'to''', while
	   ttiipp sends it the ``from'' file.  If the ``to'' file isn't specified
	   the ``from'' file name is used.  This command is actually a UNIX
	   specific version of the ``~>'' command.

     ~~tt _f_r_o_m [_t_o]
	   Take a file from a remote UNIX host.  As in the put command the
	   ``to'' file defaults to the ``from'' file name if it isn't
	   specified.  The remote host executes the command string ``cat
	   'from';echo ^A'' to send the file to ttiipp.

     ~~	   Pipe the output from a remote command to a local UNIX process.  The
	   command string sent to the local UNIX system is processed by the
	   shell.

     ~~$$    Pipe the output from a local UNIX process to the remote host.  The
	   command string sent to the local UNIX system is processed by the
	   shell.

     ~~##    Send a BREAK to the remote system.  For systems which don't support
	   the necessary _i_o_c_t_l call the break is simulated by a sequence of
	   line speed changes and DEL characters.
     ~~ss    Set a variable (see the discussion below).

     ~~^^ZZ   Stop ttiipp (only available with job control).

     ~~^^YY   Stop only the ``local side'' of ttiipp (only available with job con-
	   trol); the ``remote side'' of ttiipp, the side that displays output
	   from the remote host, is left running.

     TTiipp uses the file /_e_t_c/_r_e_m_o_t_e to find how to reach a particular system
     and to find out how it should operate while talking to the system; refer
     to remote(5) for a full description.  Each system has a default baud rate
     with which to establish a connection.  If this value is not suitable, the
     baud rate to be used may be specified on the command line, e.g. ``tip
     -300 mds''.

     When ttiipp establishes a connection it sends out a connection message to
     the remote system; the default value, if any, is defined in /_e_t_c/_r_e_m_o_t_e
     (see remote(5)).

     When ttiipp prompts for an argument (e.g. during setup of a file transfer)
     the line typed may be edited with the standard erase and kill characters.
     A null line in response to a prompt, or an interrupt, will abort the di-
     alogue and return you to the remote machine.

     TTiipp guards against multiple users connecting to a remote system by open-
     ing modems and terminal lines with exclusive access, and by honoring the
     locking protocol used by uucp(1).

     During file transfers ttiipp provides a running count of the number of lines
     transferred.  When using the ~> and ~< commands, the ``eofread'' and
     ``eofwrite'' variables are used to recognize end-of-file when reading,
     and specify end-of-file when writing (see below).	File transfers normal-
     ly depend on tandem mode for flow control.  If the remote system does not
     support tandem mode, ``echocheck'' may be set to indicate ttiipp should syn-
     chronize with the remote system on the echo of each transmitted charac-
     ter.

     When ttiipp must dial a phone number to connect to a system it will print
     various messages indicating its actions.  TTiipp supports the DEC DN-11 and
     Racal-Vadic 831 auto-call-units; the DEC DF02 and DF03, Ventel 212+,
     Racal-Vadic 3451, and Bizcomp 1031 and 1032 integral call unit/modems.

  VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS
     TTiipp maintains a set of _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e_s which control its operation.  Some of
     these variable are read-only to normal users (root is allowed to change
     anything of interest).  Variables may be displayed and set through the
     ``s'' escape.  The syntax for variables is patterned after vi(1) and
     Mail(1).  Supplying ``all'' as an argument to the set command displays
     all variables readable by the user.  Alternatively, the user may request
     display of a particular variable by attaching a `?' to the end.  For ex-
     ample ``escape?'' displays the current escape character.

     Variables are numeric, string, character, or boolean values.  Boolean
     variables are set merely by specifying their name; they may be reset by
     prepending a `!' to the name.  Other variable types are set by con-
     catenating an `=' and the value.  The entire assignment must not have any
     blanks in it.  A single set command may be used to interrogate as well as
     set a number of variables.  Variables may be initialized at run time by
     placing set commands (without the ``~s'' prefix in a file ._t_i_p_r_c in one's
     home directory).  The --vv option causes ttiipp to display the sets as they
     are made.	Certain common variables have abbreviations.  The following is
     a list of common variables, their abbreviations, and their default
     values.

     _b_e_a_u_t_i_f_y	 (bool) Discard unprintable characters when a session is being
		 scripted; abbreviated _b_e.

     _b_a_u_d_r_a_t_e	 (num) The baud rate at which the connection was established;
		 abbreviated _b_a.

     _d_i_a_l_t_i_m_e_o_u_t
		 (num) When dialing a phone number, the time (in seconds) to
		 wait for a connection to be established; abbreviated _d_i_a_l.

     _e_c_h_o_c_h_e_c_k	 (bool) Synchronize with the remote host during file transfer
		 by waiting for the echo of the last character transmitted;
		 default is _o_f_f.

     _e_o_f_r_e_a_d	 (str) The set of characters which signify and end-of-
		 tranmission during a ~< file transfer command; abbreviated
		 _e_o_f_r.

     _e_o_f_w_r_i_t_e	 (str) The string sent to indicate end-of-transmission during
		 a ~> file transfer command; abbreviated _e_o_f_w.

     _e_o_l	 (str) The set of characters which indicate an end-of-line.
		 TTiipp will recognize escape characters only after an end-of-
		 line.

     _e_s_c_a_p_e	 (char) The command prefix (escape) character; abbreviated _e_s;
		 default value is `~'.

     _e_x_c_e_p_t_i_o_n_s
		 (str) The set of characters which should not be discarded due
		 to the beautification switch; abbreviated _e_x; default value
		 is ``\t\n\f\b''.

     _f_o_r_c_e	 (char) The character used to force literal data transmission;
		 abbreviated _f_o; default value is `^P'.

     _f_r_a_m_e_s_i_z_e	 (num) The amount of data (in bytes) to buffer between file
		 system writes when receiving files; abbreviated _f_r.

     _h_o_s_t	 (str) The name of the host to which you are connected; abbre-
		 viated _h_o.

     _p_r_o_m_p_t	 (char) The character which indicates and end-of-line on the
		 remote host; abbreviated _p_r; default value is `\n'.  This
		 value is used to synchronize during data transfers.  The
		 count of lines transferred during a file transfer command is
		 based on recipt of this character.

     _r_a_i_s_e	 (bool) Upper case mapping mode; abbreviated _r_a; default value
		 is _o_f_f.  When this mode is enabled, all lower case letters
		 will be mapped to upper case by ttiipp for transmission to the
		 remote machine.

     _r_a_i_s_e_c_h_a_r	 (char) The input character used to toggle upper case mapping
		 mode; abbreviated _r_c; default value is `^A'.

     _r_e_c_o_r_d	 (str) The name of the file in which a session script is
		 recorded; abbreviated _r_e_c; default value is ``tip.record''.

     _s_c_r_i_p_t	 (bool) Session scripting mode; abbreviated _s_c; default is
		 _o_f_f.  When _s_c_r_i_p_t is true, ttiipp will record everything
		 transmitted by the remote machine in the script record file
		 specified in _r_e_c_o_r_d.  If the _b_e_a_u_t_i_f_y switch is on, only
		 printable ASCII characters will be included in the script
		 file (those characters betwee 040 and 0177).  The variable
		 _e_x_c_e_p_t_i_o_n_s is used to indicate characters which are an excep-
		 tion to the normal beautification rules.

     _t_a_b_e_x_p_a_n_d	 (bool) Expand tabs to spaces during file transfers; abbrevi-
		 ated _t_a_b; default value is _f_a_l_s_e.  Each tab is expanded to 8
		 spaces.

     _v_e_r_b_o_s_e	 (bool) Verbose mode; abbreviated _v_e_r_b; default is _t_r_u_e.  When
		 verbose mode is enabled, ttiipp prints messages while dialing,
		 shows the current number of lines transferred during a file
		 transfer operations, and more.
