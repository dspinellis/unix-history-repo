DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     PPrriinnttff formats and prints its arguments, after the first, under control
     of the _f_o_r_m_a_t.  The _f_o_r_m_a_t is a character string which contains three
     types of objects: plain characters, which are simply copied to standard
     output, character escape sequences which are converted and copied to the
     standard output, and format specifications, each of which causes printing
     of the next successive _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t.

     The _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s after the first are treated as strings if the corresponding
     format is either cc or ss; otherwise it is evaluated as a C constant, with
     the following extensions:

	   A leading plus or minus sign is allowed.
	   If the leading character is a single or double quote, or not a di-
	   git, plus, or minus sign, the value is the ASCII code of the next
	   character.

     The format string is reused as often as necessary to satisfy the
     _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s.  Any extra format specifications are evaluated with zero or
     the null string.

     Character escape sequences are in backslash notation as defined in the
     draft proposed ANSI C Standard X3J11.  The characters and their meanings
     are as follows:

     \\aa    Write a <bell> character.

     \\bb    Write a <backspace> character.

     \\ff    Write a <form-feed> character.

     \\nn    Write a <new-line> character.

     \\rr    Write a <carriage return> character.

     \\tt    Write a <tab> character.

     \\vv    Write a <vertical tab> character.

     \\''    Write a <single quote> character.

     \\\\    Write a backslash character.

     \\_n_u_m
	   Write an 8-bit character whose ASCII value is the 1-, 2-, or 3-
	   digit octal number _n_u_m.

     Each format specification is introduced by the percent character (``%'').
     The remainder of the format specification includes, in the following ord-
     er:

     Zero or more of the following flags:

	   ##	  A `#' character specifying that the value should be printed
		 in an ``alternate form''.  For cc, dd, and ss, formats, this op-
		 tion has no effect.  For the oo formats the precision of the
		 number is increased to force the first character of the out-
		 put string to a zero.	For the xx (XX) format, a non-zero
		 result has the string 0x (0X) prepended to it.  For ee, EE, ff,
		 gg, and GG, formats, the result will always contain a decimal
		 point, even if no digits follow the point (normally, a de-
		 cimal point only appears in the results of those formats if a
		 digit follows the decimal point).  For gg and GG formats,
		 trailing zeros are not removed from the result as they would
		 otherwise be;

	   --	 A minus sign `-' which specifies _l_e_f_t _a_d_j_u_s_t_m_e_n_t of the out-
		 put in the indicated field;

	   ++	 A `+' character specifying that there should always be a sign
		 placed before the number when using signed formats.

	   ` '	 A space specifying that a blank should be left before a
		 positive number for a signed format.  A `+' overrides a space
		 if both are used;

	   00	 A zero `0' character indicating that zero-padding should be
		 used rather than blank-padding.  A `-' overrides a `0' if
		 both are used;

     Field Width:
	   An optional digit string specifying a _f_i_e_l_d _w_i_d_t_h; if the output
	   string has fewer characters than the field width it will be blank-
	   padded on the left (or right, if the left-adjustment indicator has
	   been given) to make up the field width (note that a leading zero is
	   a flag, but an embedded zero is part of a field width);

     Precision:
	   An optional period, `..', followed by an optional digit string giv-
	   ing a _p_r_e_c_i_s_i_o_n which specifies the number of digits to appear
	   after the decimal point, for ee and ff formats, or the maximum number
	   of characters to be printed from a string; if the digit string is
	   missing, the precision is treated as zero;

     Format:
	   A character which indicates the type of format to use (one of
	   ddiioouuxxXXffwwEEggGGccss).

     A field width or precision may be `**' instead of a digit string.  In this
     case an _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t supplies the field width or precision.

     The format characters and their meanings are:

     ddiioouuXXxx    The _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t is printed as a signed decimal (d or i), unsigned
	       decimal, unsigned octal, or unsigned hexadecimal (X or x),
	       respectively.

     ff	       The _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t is printed in the style `[-]ddd.ddd' where the
	       number of d's after the decimal point is equal to the precision
	       specification for the argument.	If the precision is missing, 6
	       digits are given; if the precision is explicitly 0, no digits
	       and no decimal point are printed.

     eeEE        The _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t is printed in the style `[-]d.dddee+_dd' where there
	       is one digit before the decimal point and the number after is
	       equal to the precision specification for the argument; when the
	       precision is missing, 6 digits are produced.  An upper-case E
	       is used for an `E' format.

     ggGG        The _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t is printed in style ff or in style ee (EE) whichever
	       gives full precision in minimum space.

     cc	       The first character of _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t is printed.

     ss	       Characters from the string _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t are printed until the end
	       is reached or until the number of characters indicated by the
	       precision specification is reached; however if the precision is
	       0 or missing, all characters in the string are printed.

     %%	       Print a `%'; no argument is used.

     In no case does a non-existent or small field width cause truncation of a
     field; padding takes place only if the specified field width exceeds the
     actual width.

     PPrriinnttff as a command, appears in 4.3+Reno BSD.  It is modeled after the
     standard library function, printf(3).

BBUUGGSS
     Since the number is translated from ASCII to floating-point, and then
     back again, floating-point precision may be lost.

     ANSI hexadecimal character constants were deliberately not provided.
