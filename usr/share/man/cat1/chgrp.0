     The chgrp utility sets the group ID of the file named by each _f_i_l_e
     operand to the _g_r_o_u_p ID specified by the group operand.

     Options:

     --RR    Recursively change file group IDs.  For each _f_i_l_e operand that
	   names a directory, chgrp changes the group of the directory and all
	   files in the file hierarchy below it.  When symbolic links are en-
	   countered, their group is changed, but they are not traversed.

     --ff    The force option ignores errors, except for usage errors and
	   doesn't query about strange modes (unless user does not have proper
	   permissions).

     Operands:

     _g_r_o_u_p
	   The _g_r_o_u_p can be either a group name from the group database, or a
	   numeric group ID.

     _f_i_l_e
	   A pathname of a file whose group ID is to be modified.

     The user invoking must belong to the specified group and be the owner of
     the file, or be the super-user.

     The cchhggrrpp utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
