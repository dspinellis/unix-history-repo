     xxssttrr - extract strings from C programs to implement shared strings

     XXssttrr maintains a file _s_t_r_i_n_g_s into which strings in component parts of a
     large program are hashed.  These strings are replaced with references to
     this common area.  This serves to implement shared constant strings, most
     useful if they are also read-only.

     Available options:

     --       XXssttrr reads from the standard input.

     --cc      XXssttrr will extract the strings from the C source _f_i_l_e or the stan-
             dard input (--), replacing string references by expressions of the
             form (&xstr[number]) for some number.  An appropriate declaration
             of xxssttrr is prepended to the file.  The resulting C text is placed
             in the file _x_._c, to then be compiled.  The strings from this file
             are placed in the _s_t_r_i_n_g_s data base if they are not there al-
             ready.  Repeated strings and strings which are suffices of exist-
             ing strings do not cause changes to the data base.

     After all components of a large program have been compiled a file _x_s_._c
     declaring the common xxssttrr space can be created by a command of the form

           xstr

     The file _x_s_._c should then be compiled and loaded with the rest of the
     program.  If possible, the array can be made read-only (shared) saving
     space and swap overhead.

     XXssttrr can also be used on a single file.  A command

           xstr name

     creates files _x_._c and _x_s_._c as before, without using or affecting any
     _s_t_r_i_n_g_s file in the same directory.

     It may be useful to run xxssttrr after the C preprocessor if any macro defi-
     nitions yield strings or if there is conditional code which contains
     strings which may not, in fact, be needed.  An appropriate command se-
     quence for running xxssttrr after the C preprocessor is:

           cc -E name.c | xstr -c -
           cc -c x.c
           mv x.o name.o

     XXssttrr does not touch the file _s_t_r_i_n_g_s unless new items are added, thus
     make(1) can avoid remaking _x_s_._o unless truly necessary.

     If a string is a suffix of another string in the data base, but the
     shorter string is seen first by xxssttrr both strings will be placed in the
     data base, when just placing the longer one there will do.

     The xxssttrr command appeared in 3.0BSD.
