     _X_s_t_r maintains a file _s_t_r_i_n_g_s into which strings in com-
     ponent parts of a large program are hashed.  These strings
     are replaced with references to this common area.	This
     serves to implement shared constant strings, most useful if
     they are also read-only.

     The command

	  xxssttrr --cc name

     will extract the strings from the C source in name, replac-
     ing string references by expressions of the form
     (&xstr[number]) for some number.  An appropriate declaration
     of _x_s_t_r is prepended to the file.	The resulting C text is
     placed in the file _x._c, to then be compiled.  The strings
     from this file are placed in the _s_t_r_i_n_g_s data base if they
     are not there already.  Repeated strings and strings which
     are suffices of existing strings do not cause changes to the
     data base.

     After all components of a large program have been compiled a
     file _x_s._c declaring the common _x_s_t_r space can be created by
     a command of the form

	  xxssttrr

     This _x_s._c file should then be compiled and loaded with the
     rest of the program.  If possible, the array can be made
     read-only (shared) saving space and swap overhead.

     _X_s_t_r can also be used on a single file.  A command

	  xxssttrr name

     creates files _x._c and _x_s._c as before, without using or
     affecting any _s_t_r_i_n_g_s file in the same directory.

     It may be useful to run _x_s_t_r after the C preprocessor if any
     macro definitions yield strings or if there is conditional
     code which contains strings which may not, in fact, be
     needed.  _X_s_t_r reads from its standard input when the argu-
     ment `-' is given.  An appropriate command sequence for run-
     ning _x_s_t_r after the C preprocessor is:

     _X_s_t_r does not touch the file _s_t_r_i_n_g_s unless new items are
     added, thus _m_a_k_e can avoid remaking _x_s._o unless truly neces-
     sary.

     If a string is a suffix of another string in the data base,
     but the shorter string is seen first by _x_s_t_r both strings
     will be placed in the data base, when just placing the
     longer one there will do.
