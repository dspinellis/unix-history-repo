     The hexdump utility is a filter which displays the specified files, or
     the standard input, if no files are specified, in a user specified for-
     mat.

     The options are as follows:

     --bb        _O_n_e-_b_y_t_e _o_c_t_a_l _d_i_s_p_l_a_y.	Display the input offset in hexade-
	       cimal, followed by sixteen space-separated, three column,
	       zero-filled, bytes of input data, in octal, per line.

     --cc        _O_n_e-_b_y_t_e _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r _d_i_s_p_l_a_y.  Display the input offset in hexa-
	       decimal, followed by sixteen space-separated, three column,
	       space-filled, characters of input data per line.

     --dd        _T_w_o-_b_y_t_e _d_e_c_i_m_a_l _d_i_s_p_l_a_y.  Display the input offset in hexade-
	       cimal, followed by eight space-separated, five column, zero-
	       filled, two-byte units of input data, in unsigned decimal, per
	       line.

     --ee _f_o_r_m_a_t__s_t_r_i_n_g
	       Specify a format string to be used for displaying data.

     --ff _f_o_r_m_a_t__f_i_l_e
	       Specify a file that contains one or more newline separated
	       format strings.	Empty lines and lines whose first non-blank
	       character is a hash mark (##) are ignored.

     --nn _l_e_n_g_t_h
	       Interpret only _l_e_n_g_t_h bytes of input.

     --oo        _T_w_o-_b_y_t_e _o_c_t_a_l _d_i_s_p_l_a_y.	Display the input offset in hexade-
	       cimal, followed by eight space-separated, six column, zero-
	       filled, two byte quantities of input data, in octal, per line.

     --ss _o_f_f_s_e_t
	       Skip _o_f_f_s_e_t bytes from the beginning of the input.  By default,
	       _o_f_f_s_e_t is interpreted as a decimal number.  With a leading 00xx
	       or 00XX, _o_f_f_s_e_t is interpreted as a hexadecimal number, other-
	       wise, with a leading 00, _o_f_f_s_e_t is interpreted as an octal
	       number.	Appending the character bb, kk, or mm to _o_f_f_s_e_t causes it
	       to be interpreted as a multiple of 512, 1024, or 1048576,
	       respectively.

     --vv        The --vv option causes hexdump to display all input data.
	       Without the --vv option, any number of groups of output lines,
	       which would be identical to the immediately preceding group of
	       output lines (except for the input offsets), are replaced with
	       a line comprised of a single asterisk.

     --xx        _T_w_o-_b_y_t_e _h_e_x_a_d_e_c_i_m_a_l _d_i_s_p_l_a_y.  Display the input offset in hex-
	       adecimal, followed by eight, space separated, four column,
	       zero-filled, two-byte quantities of input data, in hexadecimal,
	       per line.

     For each input file, hheexxdduummpp sequentially copies the input to standard
     output, transforming the data according to the format strings specified
     by the --ee and --ff options, in the order that they were specified.

     A format string contains any number of format units, separated by whi-
     tespace.  A format unit contains up to three items: an iteration count, a
     byte count, and a format.

     The iteration count is an optional positive integer, which defaults to
     one.  Each format is applied iteration count times.

     The byte count is an optional positive integer.  If specified it defines
     the number of bytes to be interpreted by each iteration of the format.

     If an iteration count and/or a byte count is specified, a single slash
     must be placed after the iteration count and/or before the byte count to
     disambiguate them.  Any whitespace before or after the slash is ignored.

     The format is required and must be surrounded by double quote (" ")
     marks.  It is interpreted as a fprintf-style format string (see
     fprintf(3)), with the following exceptions:

	   oo++	 An asterisk (*) may not be used as a field width or preci-
		 sion.

	   oo++	 A byte count or field precision _i_s required for each ``s''
		 conversion character (unlike the fprintf(3) default which
		 prints the entire string if the precision is unspecified).

	   oo++	 The conversion characters ``h'', ``n'', and ``p'' are not
		 supported.

	   oo++	 The single character escape sequences described in the C
		 standard are supported:

		       NUL		    \0
		       <alert character>    \a
		       <backspace>	    \b
		       <form-feed>	    \f
		       <newline>	    \n
		       <carriage return>    \r
		       <tab>		    \t
		       <vertical tab>	    \v

     Hexdump also supports the the following additional conversion strings:

     __aa[ddooxx]   Display the input offset, cumulative across input files, of the
	       next byte to be displayed.  The appended characters dd, oo, and xx
	       specify the display base as decimal, octal or hexadecimal
	       respectively.

     __AA[ddooxx]   Identical to the __aa conversion string except that it is only
	       performed once, when all of the input data has been processed.

     __cc        Output characters in the default character set.	Nonprinting
	       characters are displayed in three character, zero-padded octal,
	       except for those representable by standard escape notation (see
	       above), which are displayed as two character strings.

     __pp        Output characters in the default character set.	Nonprinting
	       characters are displayed as a single ``..''.

     __uu        Output US ASCII characters, with the exception that control
	       characters are displayed using the following, lower-case,
	       names.  Characters greater than 0xff, hexadecimal, are
	       displayed as hexadecimal strings.

	       000 nul	  001 soh    002 stx	003 etx    004 eot    005 enq
	       006 ack	  007 bel    008 bs	009 ht	   00A lf     00B vt
	       00C ff	  00D cr     00E so	00F si	   010 dle    011 dc1
	       012 dc2	  013 dc3    014 dc4	015 nak    016 syn    017 etb
	       018 can	  019 em     01A sub	01B esc    01C fs     01D gs
	       01E rs	  01F us     0FF del

     The default and supported byte counts for the conversion characters are
     as follows:

	   %_c, %_p, %_u, %c	    One byte counts only.

	   %d, %i, %o, %u, %X, %x   Four byte default, one and two byte counts
				    supported.

	   %E, %e, %f, %G, %g	    Eight byte default, four byte counts
				    supported.

     The amount of data interpreted by each format string is the sum of the
     data required by each format unit, which is the iteration count times the
     byte count, or the iteration count times the number of bytes required by
     the format if the byte count is not specified.

     The input is manipulated in ``blocks'', where a block is defined as the
     largest amount of data specified by any format string.  Format strings
     interpreting less than an input block's worth of data, whose last format
     unit both interprets some number of bytes and does not have a specified
     iteration count, have the the interation count incremented until the
     entire input block has been processed or there is not enough data
     remaining in the block to satisfy the format string.

     If, either as a result of user specification or hexdump modifying the
     iteration count as described above, an iteration count is greater than
     one, no trailing whitespace characters are output during the last
     iteration.

     It is an error to specify a byte count as well as multiple conversion
     characters or strings unless all but one of the conversion characters or
     strings is __aa or __AA.

     If, as a result of the specification of the --nn option or end-of-file be-
     ing reached, input data only partially satisfies a format string, the in-
     put block is zero-padded sufficiently to display all available data (i.e.
     any format units overlapping the end of data will display some number of
     the zero bytes).

     Further output by such format strings is replaced by an equivalent number
     of spaces.  An equivalent number of spaces is defined as the number of
     spaces output by an ss conversion character with the same field width and
     precision as the original conversion character or conversion string but
     with any ``+'', `` '', ``#'' conversion flag characters removed, and re-
     ferencing a NULL string.

     If no format strings are specified, the default display is equivalent to
     specifying the --xx option.

     hheexxdduummpp exits 0 on success and >0 if an error occurred.
