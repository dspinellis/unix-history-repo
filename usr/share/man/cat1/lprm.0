     llpprrmm - remove jobs from the line printer spooling queue

     llpprrmm [--PP_p_r_i_n_t_e_r] [--] [job # ...] [_u_s_e_r ...]

     LLpprrmm will remove a job, or jobs, from a printer's spool queue.  Since the
     spooling directory is protected from users, using llpprrmm is normally the
     only method by which a user may remove a job.  The owner of a job is
     determined by the user's login name and host name on the machine where
     the lpr(1) command was invoked.

     Options and arguments:

     --PP_p_r_i_n_t_e_r
	       Specify the queue associated with a specific _p_r_i_n_t_e_r (otherwise
	       the default printer is used).

     --	       If a single `--' is given, llpprrmm will remove all jobs which a
	       user owns.  If the super-user employs this flag, the spool
	       queue will be emptied entirely.

     _u_s_e_r      Causes llpprrmm to attempt to remove any jobs queued belonging to
	       that user (or users).  This form of invoking llpprrmm is useful
	       only to the super-user.

     _j_o_b #     A user may dequeue an individual job by specifying its job
	       number.	This number may be obtained from the _l_p_q _1 program,
	       e.g.

		     % lpq -l

		     1st:ken			 [job #013ucbarpa]
			  (standard input)	 100 bytes
		     % lprm 13

     If neither arguments or options are given, LLpprrmm will delete the currently
     active job if it is owned by the user who invoked llpprrmm.

     LLpprrmm announces the names of any files it removes and is silent if there
     are no jobs in the queue which match the request list.

     LLpprrmm will kill off an active daemon, if necessary, before removing any
     spooling files.  If a daemon is killed, a new one is automatically res-
     tarted upon completion of file removals.

     The following environment variable exists, it is utilized by llpprrmm.

     PRINTER   If the environment variable PRINTER exists, and a printer has
	       not been specified with the --PP option, the default printer is
	       assumed from PRINTER.

     ``Permission denied" if the user tries to remove files other than his
     own.

     Since there are race conditions possible in the update of the lock file,
     the currently active job may be incorrectly identified.
