     WWhhooiiss looks up records in the Network Information Center (NIC) database.

     The options are as follows:

     --hh      Use the specified host instead of the default NIC (nic.ddn.mil).

     The operands specified to wwhhooiiss are concatenated together (separated by
     white-space) and presented to the wwhhooiiss server.

     The default action, unless directed otherwise with a special _n_a_m_e, is to
     do a very broad search, looking for matches to _n_a_m_e in all types of
     records and most fields (name, nicknames, hostname, net address, etc.) in
     the database.  For more information as to what _n_a_m_e operands have special
     meaning, and how to guide the search, use the special name ``_h_e_l_p''.
