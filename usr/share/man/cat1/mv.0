     In its first form, the mmvv utility renames the file named by the _s_o_u_r_c_e
     operand to the destination path named by the _t_a_r_g_e_t operand.  This form
     is assumed when the last operand does not name an already existing direc-
     tory.

     In its second form, mmvv moves each file named by a _s_o_u_r_c_e operand to a
     destination file in the existing directory named by the _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
     operand.  The destination path for each operand is the pathname produced
     by the concatenation of the last operand, a slash, and the final pathname
     component of the named file.

     The following options are available:

     --ff    Do not prompt for confirmation before overwriting the destination
	   path.  (The --ii option is ignored if the --ff option is specified.)

     --ii    Causes mmvv to write a prompt to standard error before moving a file
	   that would overwrite an existing file.  If the response from the
	   standard input begins with the character ``y'', the move is at-
	   tempted.

     It is an error for either the _s_o_u_r_c_e operand or the destination path to
     specify a directory unless both do.

     If the destination path does not have a mode which permits writing, mmvv
     prompts the user for confirmation as specified for the --ii option.

     As the rename(2) call does not work across file systems, mmvv uses cp(1)
     and rm(1) to accomplish the move.	The effect is equivalent to:

	   rm -f destination_path && \
	   cp -pr source_file destination && \
	   rm -rf source_file

     The mmvv utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

     The mmvv function is expected to be POSIX 1003.2 compatible.
