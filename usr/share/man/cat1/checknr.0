     CChheecckknnrr checks a list of nroff(1) or troff(1) input files for certain
     kinds of errors involving mismatched opening and closing delimiters and
     unknown commands.	If no files are specified, cchheecckknnrr checks the standard
     input.  Delimeters checked are:

	   oo++	 Font changes using \fx ... \fP.

	   oo++	 Size changes using \sx ... \s0.

	   oo++	 Macros that come in open ... close forms, for example, the
		 .TS and .TE macros which must always come in pairs.

     Options:

     --aa    Add additional pairs of macros to the list of known macros.	This
	   must be followed by groups of six characters, each group defining a
	   pair of macros.  The six characters are a period, the first macro
	   name, another period, and the second macro name.  For example, to
	   define a pair .BS and .ES, use `-a.BS.ES'

     --cc    Define commands which would otherwise be complained about as unde-
	   fined.

     --ff    Request cchheecckknnrr to ignore \f font changes.

     --ss    Ignore \s size changes.

     CChheecckknnrr is intended for use on documents that are prepared with cchheecckknnrr
     in mind, much the same as lint(1).  It expects a certain document writing
     style for \f and \s commands, in that each \fx must be terminated with
     \fP and each \sx must be terminated with \s0.  While it will work to
     directly go into the next font or explicitly specify the original font or
     point size, and many existing documents actually do this, such a practice
     will produce complaints from cchheecckknnrr.  Since it is probably better to use
     the \fP and \s0 forms anyway, you should think of this as a contribution
     to your document preparation style.

     CChheecckknnrr knows about the ms(7) and me(7) macro packages.
