     The ppaassttee utility concatenates the corresponding lines of the given input
     files, replacing all but the last file's newline characters with a single
     tab character, and writes the resulting lines to standard output.	If
     end-of-file is reached on an input file while other input files still
     contain data, the file is treated as if it were an endless source of emp-
     ty lines.

     The options are as follows:

     --dd_l_i_s_t    Use one or more of the provided characters to replace the
	       newline characters instead of the default tab.  The characters
	       in _l_i_s_t are used circularly, i.e., when _l_i_s_t is exhausted the
	       first character from _l_i_s_t is reused.  This continues until a
	       line from the last input file (in default operation) or the
	       last line in each file (using the -s option) is displayed, at
	       which time ppaassttee begins selecting characters from the beginning
	       of _l_i_s_t again.

	       The following special characters can also be used in list:

	       \n    newline character

	       \t    tab character

	       \\    backslash character

	       \0    Empty string (not a null character).

		     Any other character preceded by a backslash is equivalent
		     to the character itself.

     --ss        Concatenate all of the lines of each separate input file in
	       command line order.  The newline character of every line except
	       the last line in each input file is replaced with the tab char-
	       acter, unless otherwise specified by the -d option.

     If ``-'' is specified for one or more of the input files, the standard
     input is used; standard input is read one line at a time, circularly, for
     each instance of ``-''.

     The ppaassttee utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
