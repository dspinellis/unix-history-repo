     SSccccss is a front end to the SCCS programs that helps them mesh more clean-
     ly with the rest of UNIX.	It also includes the capability to run ``set
     user id'' to another user to provide additional protection.

     Basically, ssccccss runs the command with the specified _f_l_a_g_s and _a_r_g_s.  Each
     argument is normally modified to be prepended with ``SCCS/s.''.

     Flags to be interpreted by the ssccccss program must be before the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
     argument.	Flags to be passed to the actual SCCS program must come after
     the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d argument.  These flags are specific to the command and are
     discussed in the documentation for that command.

     Besides the usual SCCS commands, several ``pseudo-commands'' can be
     issued.  These are:

     eeddiitt      Equivalent to ``get -e''.

     ddeellggeett    Perform a delta on the named files and then get new versions.
	       The new versions will have id keywords expanded, and will not
	       be editable.  The --mm, --pp, --rr, --ss, and --yy flags will be passed
	       to ddeellttaa, and the --bb,, --cc, --ee, --ii, --kk, --ll, --ss,
	       and --xx flags will be passed to get.

     ddeelleeddiitt   Equivalent to ddeellggeett except that the ggeett phase includes the --ee
	       flag.  This option is useful for making a _c_h_e_c_k_p_o_i_n_t of your
	       current editing phase.  The same flags will be passed to delta
	       as described above, and all the flags listed for above except
	       --ee and --kk are passed to eeddiitt.

     ccrreeaattee    Creates an SCCS file , taking the initial contents from the
	       file of the same name.  Any flags to aaddmmiinn are accepted.  If
	       the creation is successful, the files are renamed with a comma
	       on the front.  These should be removed when you are convinced
	       that the SCCS files have been created successfully.

     ffiixx       Must be followed by a --rr flag.  This command essentially re-
	       moves the named delta, but leaves you with a copy of the delta
	       with the changes that were in it.  It is useful for fixing
	       small compiler bugs, etc.  Since it doesn't leave audit trails,
	       it should be used carefully.

     cclleeaann     This routine removes everything from the current directory that
	       can be recreated from SCCS files.  It will not remove any files
	       being edited.  If the --bb flag is given, branches are ignored in
	       the determination of whether they are being edited; this is
	       dangerous if you are keeping the branches in the same directo-
	       ry.

     uunneeddiitt    This is the opposite of an eeddiitt or a ``get -e''.  It should be
	       used with extreme caution, since any changes you made since the
	       get will be irretrievably lost.

     iinnffoo      Gives a listing of all files being edited.  If the --bb flag is
	       given, branches (i.e., SID's with two or fewer components) are
	       ignored.  If the --uu flag is given (with an optional argument)
	       then only files being edited by you (or the named user) are
	       listed.
     cchheecckk     Like iinnffoo except that nothing is printed if nothing is being
	       edited, and a non-zero exit status is returned if anything is
	       being edited.  The intent is to have this included in an
	       _i_n_s_t_a_l_l entry in a makefile to insure that everything is in-
	       cluded into the SCCS file before a version is installed.

     tteellll      Gives a newline-separated list of the files being edited on the
	       standard output.  Takes the --bb and --uu flags like iinnffoo and
	       cchheecckk.

     ddiiffffss     Gives a ddiiffff listing between the current version of the
	       program(s) you have out for editing and the versions in SCCS
	       format.	The --rr, --cc, --ii, --xx, and --tt flags are passed to
	       ggeett; the --ll, --ss, --ee, --ff, --hh, and --bb options are passed to
	       ddiiffff.  The --CC flag is passed to ddiiffff as --cc.

     pprriinntt     This command prints out verbose information about the named
	       files.

     --rr        Runs ssccccss as the real user rather than as whatever effective
	       user ssccccss is ``set user id'' to.

     --dd        Specifies a root directory for the SCCS files.  The default is
	       the current directory.  If environment variable PROJECT is set,
	       it will be used to determine the --dd flag.

     --pp        flag defines the pathname of the directory in which the SCCS
	       files will be found; ``SCCS'' is the default.  The --pp flag
	       differs from the --dd flag in that the --dd argument is prepended
	       to the entire pathname and the --pp argument is inserted before
	       the final component of the pathname.  For example, ``sccs -d/x
	       -py get a/b'' will convert to ``get /x/a/y/s.b''.  The intent
	       here is to create aliases such as ``alias syssccs sccs -
	       d/usr/src'' which will be used as ``syssccs get cmd/who.c''.

	       Certain commands (such as aaddmmiinn) cannot be run ``set user id''
	       by all users, since this would allow anyone to change the au-
	       thorizations.  These commands are always run as the real user.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
     To get a file for editing, edit it, and produce a new delta:

	   sccs get -e file.c
	   ex file.c
	   sccs delta file.c

     To get a file from another directory:

	   sccs -p/usr/src/sccs/s. get cc.c

     or

	   sccs get /usr/src/sccs/s.cc.c

     To make a delta of a large number of files in the current directory:

	   sccs delta *.c

     To get a list of files being edited that are not on branches:

	   sccs info -b

     To delta everything being edited by you:

	   sccs delta `sccs tell -u`

     In a makefile, to get source files from an SCCS file if it does not al-
     ready exist:

	   SRCS = <list of source files>
	   $(SRCS):
		sccs get $(REL) $@

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     PROJECT	 The PROJECT environment variable is checked by the --dd flag.
		 If it begins with a slash, it is taken directly; otherwise,
		 the home directory of a user of that name is examined for a
		 subdirectory ``src'' or ``source''.  If such a directory is
		 found, it is used.

     It should be able to take directory arguments on pseudo-commands like the
     SCCS commands do.
