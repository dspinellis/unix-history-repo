     ppddxx [--rr] [_o_b_j_f_i_l_e]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     PPddxx is a tool for source level debugging and execution of Pascal pro-
     grams.  The _o_b_j_f_i_l_e is an object file produced by the Pascal translator
     pi(1).  If no _o_b_j_f_i_l_e is specified, ppddxx looks for a file named ``obj'' in
     the current directory.  The object file contains a symbol table which in-
     cludes the name of the all the source files translated by pi(1) to create
     it.  These files are available for perusal while using the debugger.

     If the file ``._p_d_x_i_n_i_t'' exists in the current directory, then the de-
     bugger commands in it are executed.

     --rr        The --rr option causes the _o_b_j_f_i_l_e to be executed immediately; if
	       it terminates successfully ppddxx exits.  Otherwise it reports the
	       reason for termination and offers the user the option of enter-
	       ing the debugger or simply letting px continue with a trace-
	       back.  If --rr is not specified, ppddxx just prompts and waits for a
	       command.

     The commands are:

     rruunn [_a_r_g_s] [<< _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e] [>> _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e]
	       Start executing _o_b_j_f_i_l_e, passing _a_r_g_s as command line argu-
	       ments; << or >> can be used to redirect input or output in the
	       usual manner.

	       Have tracing information printed when the program is executed.
	       A number is associated with the command that is used to turn
	       the tracing off (see the ddeelleettee command).

	       The first argument describes what is to be traced.  If it is a
	       _s_o_u_r_c_e-_l_i_n_e-_n_u_m_b_e_r, then the line is printed immediately prior
	       to being executed.  Source line numbers in a file other than
	       the current one must be preceded by the name of the file and a
	       colon, e.g.  ``mumble.p:17''.

	       If the argument is a procedure or function name then every time
	       it is called, information is printed telling what routine
	       called it, from what source line it was called, and what param-
	       eters were passed to it.  In addition, its return is noted, and
	       if it's a function then the value it is returning is also
	       printed.

	       If the argument is an _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n with an aatt clause then the
	       value of the expression is printed whenever the identified
	       source line is reached.

	       If the argument is a variable then the name and value of the
	       variable is printed whenever it changes.  Execution is substan-
	       tially slower during this form of tracing.

	       If no argument is specified then all source lines are printed
	       before they are executed.  Execution is substantially slower
	       during this form of tracing.
	       The clause ``iinn''  _p_r_o_c_e_d_u_r_e/_f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n restricts tracing
	       information to be printed only while executing inside the given
	       procedure or function.

	       _C_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n is a Pascal boolean expression and is evaluated prior
	       to printing the tracing information; if it is false then the
	       information is not printed.

	       There is no restriction on the amount of information that can
	       be traced.

	       The trace or stop corresponding to the given number is removed.
	       The numbers associated with traces and stops are printed by the
	       ssttaattuuss command.

     ssttaattuuss [>> _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e]
	       Print out the currently active ttrraaccee and ssttoopp commands.

     ccoonntt      Continue execution from where it stopped.  This can only be
	       done when the program was stopped by an interrupt or through
	       use of the ssttoopp command.

     sstteepp      Execute one source line.

     nneexxtt      Execute up to the next source line.  The difference between
	       this and sstteepp is that if the line contains a call to a pro-
	       cedure or function the sstteepp command will stop at the beginning
	       of that block, while the nneexxtt command will not.

	       function.

     hheellpp      Print out a synopsis of ppddxx commands.

	       Read ppddxx commands from the given _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.  Especially useful
	       when the _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e has been created by redirecting a ssttaattuuss com-
	       mand from an earlier debugging session.

	       List the lines in the current source file from the first line
	       number to the second inclusive.	As in the editor ``$'' can be
	       used to refer to the last line.	If no lines are specified, the
	       entire file is listed.  If the name of a procedure or function
	       is given lines _n-_k to _n+_k are listed where _n is the first
	       statement in the procedure or function and _k is small.

     ffiillee [_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e]
	       Change the current source file name to _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.  If none is
	       specified then the current source file name is printed.

	       Invoke an editor on _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e or the current source file if none
	       is specified.  If a _p_r_o_c_e_d_u_r_e or _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n name is specified,
	       the editor is invoked on the file that contains it.  Which edi-
	       tor is invoked by default depends on the installation.  The de-
	       fault can be overridden by setting the environment variable ED-
	       ITOR to the name of the desired editor.

     sshh _c_o_m_m_a_n_d-_l_i_n_e
	       Pass the command line to the shell for execution.  The SHELL
	       environment variable determines which shell is used.

	       This command makes ppddxx respond to _n_e_w-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d-_n_a_m_e the way it

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     PPddxx appeared in 4.2 BSD.

BBUUGGSS
     PPddxx does not understand sets, and provides no information about files.

     The wwhhaattiiss command doesn't quite work for variant records.

     Bad things will happen if a procedure invoked with the ccaallll command does
     a non-local goto.

     The commands sstteepp and nneexxtt should be able to take a _c_o_u_n_t that specifies
     how many lines to execute.

     There should be commands sstteeppii and nneexxttii that correspond to sstteepp and nneexxtt
     but work at the instruction level.

     There should be a way to get an address associated with a line number,
     procedure or function, and variable.

     Most of the command names are too long.

     The alias facility is quite weak.

     A csh(1) - like history capability would improve the situation.
