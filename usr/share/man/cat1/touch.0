     The ttoouucchh utility sets the modification and access times of files to the
     current time of day.  If the file doesn't exist, it is created with de-
     fault permissions.

     The following options are available:

     --aa      Change the access time of the file.  The modification time of the
             file is not changed unless the --mm flag is also specified.

     --cc      Do not create the file if it does not exist.  The ttoouucchh utility
             does not treat this as an error.  No error messages are displayed
             and the exit value is not affected.

     --ff      Attempt to force the update, even if the file permissions do not
             currently permit it.

     --mm      Change the modification time of the file.  The access time of the
             file is not changed unless the --aa flag is also specified.

     --rr      Use the access and modifications times from the specified file
             instead of the current time of day.

     --tt      Change the access and modification times to the specified time.
             The argument should be in the form ``[[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]''
             where each pair of letters represents the following:

                   _C_C      The first two digits of the year (the century).
                   _Y_Y      The second two digits of the year.  If ``YY'' is
                           specified, but ``CC'' is not, a value for ``YY''
                           between 69 and 99 results in a ``YY'' value of 19.
                           Otherwise, a ``YY'' value of 20 is used.
                   _M_M      The month of the year, from 1 to 12.
                   _D_D      the day of the month, from 1 to 31.
                   _h_h      The hour of the day, from 0 to 23.
                   _m_m      The minute of the hour, from 0 to 59.
                   _S_S      The second of the minute, from 0 to 61.

             If the ``CC'' and ``YY'' letter pairs are not specified, the val-
             ues default to the current year.  If the ``SS'' letter pair is
             not specified, the value defaults to 0.

     The ttoouucchh utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

     The obsolescent form of ttoouucchh, where a time format is specified as the
     first argument, is supported.  When no --rr or --tt option is specified,
     there are at least two arguments, and the first argument is a string of
     digits either eight or ten characters in length, the first argument is
     interprested as a time specification of the form ``MMDDhhmm[YY]''.

     The ``MM'', ``DD'', ``hh'' and ``mm'' letter pairs are treated as their
     counterparts specified to the --tt option.  If the ``YY'' letter pair is in
     the range 69 to 99, the year is set to 1969 to 1999, otherwise, the year
     is set in the 21st century.

     A ttoouucchh command appeared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX.

     The ttoouucchh function is expected to be a superset of the IEEE Std1003.2
     (``POSIX'') specification.
