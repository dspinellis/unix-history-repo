     llppqq - spool queue examination program

     LLppqq examines the spooling area used by lpd(8) for printing files on the
     line printer, and reports the status of the specified jobs or all jobs
     associated with a user.  LLppqq invoked without any arguments reports on any
     jobs currently in the queue.

     Options:

     --PP    Specify a particular printer, otherwise the default line printer is
	   used (or the value of the PRINTER variable in the environment). All
	   other arguments supplied are interpreted as user names or job
	   numbers to filter out only those jobs of interest.

     --ll    Information about each of the files comprising the job entry is
	   printed.  Normally, only as much information as will fit on one
	   line is displayed.

     For each job submitted (i.e. invocation of lpr(1)) llppqq reports the user's
     name, current rank in the queue, the names of files comprising the job,
     the job identifier (a number which may be supplied to lprm(1) for remov-
     ing a specific job), and the total size in bytes.	Job ordering is depen-
     dent on the algorithm used to scan the spooling directory and is supposed
     to be FIFO (First in First Out).  File names comprising a job may be una-
     vailable (when lpr(1) is used as a sink in a pipeline) in which case the
     file is indicated as ``(standard input)".

     If llppqq warns that there is no daemon present (i.e. due to some malfunc-
     tion), the lpc(8) command can be used to restart the printer daemon.

     If the following environment variable exists, it is used by llppqq:

     PRINTER   Specifies an alternate default printer.

     LLppqq appeared in 3 BSD.

BBUUGGSS
     Due to the dynamic nature of the information in the spooling directory
     lpq may report unreliably.  Output formatting is sensitive to the line
     length of the terminal; this can results in widely spaced columns.

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
     Unable to open various files.  The lock file being malformed.  Garbage
     files when there is no daemon active, but files in the spooling directo-
     ry.
