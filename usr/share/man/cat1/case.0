DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     SShh is a command programming language that executes commands read from a
     terminal or a file. The shell this page describes is called the _B_o_u_r_n_e
     shell.

     Command line options:

     If the first character of argument 0 if commands are read from
     $_H_O_M_E/._p_r_o_f_i_l_e, if such a file exists.  The following flags are inter-
     preted by the shell when it is invoked.

     --cc _s_t_r_i_n_g
	       Commands are read from _s_t_r_i_n_g.

     --ss        If the --ss flag is present or if no arguments remain then com-
	       mands are read from the standard input.	Shell output is writ-
	       ten to file descriptor 2.

     --ii        If the --ii flag is present or if the shell input and output are
	       attached to a terminal (as told by getty) then this shell is
	       _i_n_t_e_r_a_c_t_i_v_e.  In this case the terminate signal SIGTERM (see
	       sigvec(2)) is ignored (so that 'kill 0' does not kill an in-
	       teractive shell) and the interrupt signal SIGINT is caught and
	       ignored (so that wait is interruptible).  In all cases SIGQUIT
	       is ignored by the shell.

     This next set of options can be used on the command line invoking the sshh
     or set with the interactive command sseett.

     --ee        If non interactive, exit immediately if a command fails.

     --kk        All keyword arguments are placed in the environment for a com-
	       mand, not just those that precede the command name.

     --nn        Read commands but do not execute them.

     --tt        Exit after reading and executing one command.

     --uu        Treat unset variables as an error when substituting.

     --vv        Print shell input lines as they are read.

     --xx        Print commands and their arguments as they are executed.

     --	       Turn off the --xx and --vv options.

  CCoommmmaannddss ..
     A _s_i_m_p_l_e-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d is a sequence of non blank _w_o_r_d_s separated by blanks (a
     blank is a _t_a_b or a _s_p_a_c_e).  The first word specifies the name of the
     command to be executed.  Except as specified below the remaining words
     are passed as arguments to the invoked command.  The command name is
     passed as argument 0 (see execve(2)).  The _v_a_l_u_e of a simple-command is
     its exit status if it terminates normally or 200+_s_t_a_t_u_s if it terminates
     abnormally (see _s_i_g_v_e_c _2 for a list of status values).

     A _p_i_p_e_l_i_n_e is a sequence of one or more _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_s separated by `||'.  The
     standard output of each command but the last is connected by a pipe(2) to
     the standard input of the next command.  Each command is run as a
     separate process; the shell waits for the last command to terminate.
     A _l_i_s_t is a sequence of one or more _p_i_p_e_l_i_n_e_s separated by ;;, &&, &&&& or ||
     or |||| and optionally terminated by ;; or &&.  ;; and && have equal precedence
     which is lower than that of &&&& and ||||, &&&& and ||||, also have equal pre-
     cedence.  A semicolon causes sequential execution; an ampersand causes
     the preceding _p_i_p_e_l_i_n_e to be executed without waiting for it to finish.
     The symbol &&&& (||||) causes the _l_i_s_t following to be executed only if the
     preceding _p_i_p_e_l_i_n_e returns a zero (non zero) value.  Newlines may appear
     in a _l_i_s_t, instead of semicolons, to delimit commands.

     A _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is either a simple-command or one of the following.  The value
     returned by a command is that of the last simple-command executed in the
     command.

     ffoorr _n_a_m_e [iinn _w_o_r_d ...] ddoo _l_i_s_t ddoonnee
	       Each time a ffoorr command is executed _n_a_m_e is set to the next
	       word in the ffoorr word list.  If iinn _w_o_r_d ...  is omitted, iinn
	       ``$$@@'' is assumed.  Execution ends when there are no more words
	       in the list.

     ccaassee _w_o_r_d iinn [_p_a_t_t_e_r_n [| _p_a_t_t_e_r_n ...] )) _l_i_s_t ;;;;] ..._e_s_a_c
	       A ccaassee command executes the _l_i_s_t associated with the first pat-
	       tern that matches _w_o_r_d.	The form of the patterns is the same
	       as that used for file name generation.

     iiff _l_i_s_t tthheenn _l_i_s_t [eelliiff _l_i_s_t tthheenn _l_i_s_t] ... [eellssee _l_i_s_t] ffii
	       The _l_i_s_t following iiff is executed and if it returns zero the
	       _l_i_s_t following tthheenn is executed.  Otherwise, the _l_i_s_t following
	       eelliiff is executed and if its value is zero the _l_i_s_t following
	       tthheenn is executed.  Failing that the eellssee _l_i_s_t is executed.

     wwhhiillee _l_i_s_t [ddoo _l_i_s_t] ddoonnee
	       A wwhhiillee command repeatedly executes the wwhhiillee _l_i_s_t and if its
	       value is zero executes the ddoo _l_i_s_t; otherwise the loop ter-
	       minates.  The value returned by a wwhhiillee command is that of the
	       last executed command in the ddoo _l_i_s_t.  uunnttiill may be used in
	       place of wwhhiillee to negate the loop termination test.

     (_l_i_s_t)    Execute _l_i_s_t in a subshell.

     {_l_i_s_t}    _l_i_s_t is simply executed.

     The following words are only recognized as the first word of a command
     and when not quoted.

     The standard output from a command enclosed in a pair of back quotes (````)
     may be used as part or all of a word; trailing newlines are removed.

     The character $$ is used to introduce substitutable parameters.  Position-
     al parameters may be assigned values by sseett.  Variables may be set by
     writing

	   _n_a_m_e=_v_a_l_u_e [_n_a_m_e=_v_a_l_u_e] ...

     $$ {{_p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r}}	 A _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r is a sequence of letters, digits or un-
			 derscores (a _n_a_m_e), a digit, or any of the characters
			 ** @@ ## ?? -- $$ !!	The value, if any, of the parameter is
			 substituted.  The braces are required only when
			 _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r is followed by a letter, digit, or under-
			 score that is not to be interpreted as part of its
			 name.	If _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r is a digit, it is a positional
			 parameter.  If _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r is ** or @@ then all the posi-
			 tional parameters, starting with $$11, are substituted
			 separated by spaces.  $$00 is set from argument zero
			 when the shell is invoked.

     $$ {{_p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r--_w_o_r_d}}
			 If _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r is set, substitute its value; otherwise
			 substitute _w_o_r_d.

     $$ {{_p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r==_w_o_r_d }}
			 If _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r is not set, set it to _w_o_r_d; the value of
			 the parameter is then substituted.  Positional param-
			 eters may not be assigned to in this way.

     $$ {{_p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r??_w_o_r_d}}
			 If _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r is set, substitute its value; otherwise,
			 print _w_o_r_d and exit from the shell.  If _w_o_r_d is omit-
			 ted, a standard message is printed.

     $$ {{_p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r++_w_o_r_d}}
			 If _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r is set, substitute _w_o_r_d; otherwise sub-
			 stitute nothing.

     In the above _w_o_r_d is not evaluated unless it is to be used as the substi-
     tuted string.  (So that, for example, echo ${d-'pwd'} will only execute
     _p_w_d if _d is unset.)

     The following _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r_s are automatically set by the shell.

	   ##	 The number of positional parameters in decimal.
	   --	 Options supplied to the shell on invocation or by _s_e_t.
	   ??	 The value returned by the last executed command in decimal.
	   $$	 The process number of this shell.
	   !!	 The process number of the last background command invoked.


     The following _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r_s are used but not set by the shell.

	   HOME             The default argument (home directory) for the ccdd
			  command.

	   PATH           The search path for commands (see _e_x_e_c_u_t_i_o_n).

	   MAIL           If this variable is set to the name of a mail file,
			  the shell informs the user of the arrival of mail in
			  the specified file.

	   PS1		  Primary prompt string, by default '$ '.

	   PS2		  Secondary prompt string, by default '> '.

	   IFS		  Internal field separators, normally _s_p_a_c_e, _t_a_b, and
			  _n_e_w_l_i_n_e.  IFS is ignored if sshh is running as root or
			  if the effective user id differs from the real user
			  id.

  BBllaannkk iinntteerrpprreettaattiioonn ..
     After parameter and command substitution, any results of substitution are
     scanned for internal field separator characters (those found in $$IFS) and
     split into distinct arguments where such characters are found.  Explicit
     null arguments ("" or '') are retained.  Implicit null arguments (those
     resulting from _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r_s that have no values) are removed.

  FFiillee nnaammee ggeenneerraattiioonn ..
     Following substitution, each command word is scanned for the characters
     **, ??  and [[.  If one of these characters appears, the word is regarded as
     a pattern.  The word is replaced with alphabetically sorted file names
     that match the pattern.  If no file name is found that matches the pat-
     tern, the word is left unchanged.	The character ..  at the start of a
     file name or immediately following a //, and the character //, must be
     matched explicitly.

	   **	     Matches any string, including the null string.
	   ??	     Matches any single character.
	   [[......]]     Matches any one of the characters enclosed.  A pair of
		     characters separated by -- matches any character lexically
		     between the pair.


  QQuuoottiinngg ..
     The following characters have a special meaning to the shell and cause
     termination of a word unless quoted.

	   ;; && (( )) || << >> nneewwlliinnee ssppaaccee ttaabb

     A character may be _q_u_o_t_e_d by preceding it with a `\\'.  \\nneewwlliinnee is ig-
     nored.  All characters enclosed between a pair of quote marks (`'),
     except a single quote, are quoted.  Inside double quotes (``'') parameter
     and command substitution occurs and \\ quotes the characters \\'' and $$.

     ``$*'' is equivalent to ``$$11 $$22 ......'' whereas
     ``$$@@'' is equivalent to ``$$11'' ``$$22'' ... .

  PPrroommppttiinngg ..
     When used interactively, the shell prompts with the value of PS1 before
     reading a command.  If at any time a newline is typed and further input
     is needed to complete a command, the secondary prompt $$PS2 is issued.

  IInnppuutt//OOuuttppuutt ..
     Before a command is executed its input and output may be redirected using
     a special notation interpreted by the shell.  The following may appear
     anywhere in a simple-command or may precede or follow a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d and are
     not passed on to the invoked command.  Substitution occurs before _w_o_r_d or
     _d_i_g_i_t is used.

     << _w_o_r_d    Use file _w_o_r_d as standard input (file descriptor 0).

     >> _w_o_r_d    Use file _w_o_r_d as standard output (file descriptor 1).  If the
	       file does not exist, it is created; otherwise it is truncated
	       to zero length.

     >>>> _w_o_r_d   Use file _w_o_r_d as standard output.  If the file exists, output
	       is appended (by seeking to the end); otherwise the file is
	       created.

     <<<< _w_o_r_d   The shell input is read up to a line the same as _w_o_r_d, or end
	       of file.  The resulting document becomes the standard input.
	       If any character of _w_o_r_d is quoted, no interpretation is placed
	       upon the characters of the document; otherwise, parameter and
	       command substitution occurs, \\nneewwlliinnee is ignored, and \\ is used
	       to quote the characters $$ '' and the first character of _w_o_r_d.

     <<&& _d_i_g_i_t
	       The standard input is duplicated from file descriptor _d_i_g_i_t;
	       see dup(2).  Similarly for the standard output using >>.

     <<&&--       The standard input is closed.  Similarly for the standard out-
	       put using >>.

     If one of the above is preceded by a digit, the file descriptor created
     is that specified by the digit (instead of the default 0 or 1).  For ex-
     ample,

	   ... 2>&1

     creates file descriptor 2 to be a duplicate of file descriptor 1.

     If a command is followed by && then the default standard input for the
     command is the empty file (_d_e_v/_n_u_l_l).  Otherwise, the environment for the
     execution of a command contains the file descriptors of the invoking
     shell as modified by input output specifications.

  EEnnvviirroonnmmeenntt
     The environment is a list of name-value pairs that is passed to an exe-
     cuted program in the same way as a normal argument list; see execve(2)
     and environ(7).  The shell interacts with the environment in several
     ways.  On invocation, the shell scans the environment and creates a
     _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r for each name found, giving it the corresponding value.	Exe-
     cuted commands inherit the same environment.  If the user modifies the
     values of these _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r_s or creates new ones, none of these affects the
     environment unless the eexxppoorrtt command is used to bind the shell's
     _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r to the environment.  The environment seen by any executed com-
     mand is thus composed of any unmodified name-value pairs originally in-
     herited by the shell, plus any modifications or additions, all of which
     must be noted in eexxppoorrtt commands.

     The environment for any _s_i_m_p_l_e-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d may be augmented by prefixing it
     with one or more assignments to _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r_s.  Thus these two lines are
     equivalent

	   TERM=450 cmd args
	   (export TERM; TERM=450; cmd args)

     If the --kk flag is set, _a_l_l keyword arguments are placed in the environ-
     ment, even if they occur after the command name.  The following prints
     'a=b c' and 'c':

	   echo a=b c
	   set -k
	   echo a=b c

  SSiiggnnaallss ..
     The INTERRUPT and QUIT signals for an invoked command are ignored if the
     command is followed by &&; otherwise signals have the values inherited by
     the shell from its parent.  (But see also ttrraapp.)

  EExxeeccuuttiioonn ..
     Each time a command is executed the above substitutions are carried out.
     Except for the 'special commands' listed below a new process is created
     and an attempt is made to execute the command via an execve(2).

     The shell parameter $$$PATH defines the search path for the directory
     containing the command.  Each alternative directory name is separated by
     a colon (::).  The default path is :/_b_i_n:/_u_s_r/_b_i_n.	If the command name
     contains a //, the search path is not used.  Otherwise, each directory in
     the path is searched for an executable file.  If the file has execute
     permission but is not an _a._o_u_t file, it is assumed to be a file contain-
     ing shell commands.  A subshell (i.e., a separate process) is spawned to
     read it.  A parenthesized command is also executed in a subshell.

  SSppeecciiaall ccoommmmaannddss ..
     The following commands are executed in the shell process and except where
     specified no input output redirection is permitted for such commands.

     ##	       For non-interactive shells, everything following the ## is
	       treated as a comment, i.e. the rest of the line is ignored.
	       For interactive shells, the ## has no special effect.

     ::	       No effect; the command does nothing.

     .._f_i_l_e     Read and execute commands from _f_i_l_e and return.	The search
	       path $$PATH is used to find the directory containing _f_i_l_e.

     bbrreeaakk [_n]
	       Exit from the enclosing ffoorr or wwhhiillee loop, if any.  If _n is
	       specified, break _n levels.

     ccoonnttiinnuuee [_n]
	       Resume the next iteration of the enclosing ffoorr or wwhhiillee loop.
	       If _n is specified, resume at the _n'th enclosing loop.

     ccdd [_a_r_g]
	       Change the current directory to _a_r_g.  The shell parameter
	       $$$HOME is the default _a_r_g.

     eevvaall [_a_r_g ...]
	       The arguments are read as input to the shell and the resulting
	       command(s) executed.

     eexxeecc [_a_r_g ...]
	       The command specified by the arguments is executed in place of
	       this shell without creating a new process.  Input output
	       arguments may appear and if no other arguments are given cause
	       the shell input output to be modified.

     eexxiitt [_n]
	       Causes a non interactive shell to exit with the exit status
	       specified by _n.	If _n is omitted, the exit status is that of
	       the last command executed.  (An end of file will also exit from
	       the shell.)

     eexxppoorrtt [_n_a_m_e ...]
	       The given names are marked for automatic export to the
	       _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t of subsequently-executed commands.  If no arguments
	       are given, a list of exportable names is printed.

     llooggiinn [_a_r_g ...]
	       Equivalent to 'exec login arg ...'.

     rreeaadd _n_a_m_e ...
	       One line is read from the standard input; successive words of
	       the input are assigned to the variables _n_a_m_e in order, with
	       leftover words to the last variable.  The return code is 0 un-
	       less the end-of-file is encountered.

     rreeaaddoonnllyy [_n_a_m_e ...]
	       The given names are marked readonly and the values of the these
	       names may not be changed by subsequent assignment.  If no
	       arguments are given, a list of all readonly names is printed.

     sseett [--eekknnppttuuvvxx] [_a_r_g ...]
	       The set flags are described in the options section at the
	       beginning of this man page.  The current set of flags may be
	       found in $$--.

	       Remaining arguments after the flag are positional parameters
	       and are assigned, in order, to $$11, $$22, etc.  If no arguments
	       are given, the values of all names are printed.

     sshhiifftt     The positional parameters from $$22 ......  are renamed $$11 ......

     ttiimmeess     Print the accumulated user and system times for processes run
	       from the shell.

     ttrraapp [_a_r_g] [_n] ...
	       _A_r_g is a command to be read and executed when the shell re-
	       ceives signal(s) _n.  (Note that _a_r_g is scanned once when the
	       trap is set and once when the trap is taken.) Trap commands are
	       executed in order of signal number.  If _a_r_g is absent, all
	       trap(s) _n are reset to their original values.  If _a_r_g is the
	       null string, this signal is ignored by the shell and by invoked
	       commands.  If _n is 0, the command _a_r_g is executed on exit from
	       the shell, otherwise upon receipt of signal _n as numbered in
	       sigvec(2).  TTrraapp with no arguments prints a list of commands
	       associated with each signal number.

     uummaasskk [_n_n_n]
	       The user file creation mask is set to the octal value _n_n_n (see
	       umask(2)).  If _n_n_n is omitted, the current value of the mask is
	       printed.

     wwaaiitt [_n]
	       Wait for the specified process and report its termination
	       status.	If _n is not given, all currently active child
	       processes are waited for.  The return code from this command is
	       that of the process waited for.

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
     Errors detected by the shell, such as syntax errors cause the shell to
     return a non zero exit status.  If the shell is being used non interac-
     tively then execution of the shell file is abandoned.  Otherwise, the
     shell returns the exit status of the last command executed (see also
     eexxiitt).

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     The SShh shell appeared in Version 6 AT&Y UNIX.  If <<<< is used to provide
     standard input to an asynchronous process invoked by &&, the shell gets
     mixed up about naming the input document.	A garbage file /_t_m_p/_s_h* is
     created, and the shell complains about not being able to find the file by
     another name.
