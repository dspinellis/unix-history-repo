     The nneettssttaatt command symbolically displays the contents of various net-
     work-related data structures.  There are a number of output formats, de-
     pending on the options for the information presented.  The first form of
     the command displays a list of active sockets for each protocol.  The
     second form presents the contents of one of the other network data struc-
     tures according to the option selected.  Using the third form, with a
     _w_a_i_t interval specified, nneettssttaatt will continuously display the informa-
     tion regarding packet traffic on the configured network interfaces.  The
     fourth form displays statistics about the named protocol.

     The options have the following meaning:

     --AA    With the default display, show the address of any protocol control
           blocks associated with sockets; used for debugging.

     --BB    With the default display, show the multicast routing tables.  When
           --ss is also present, show multicast routing statistics instead.

     --aa    With the default display, show the state of all sockets; normally
           sockets used by server processes are not shown.

     --dd    With either interface display (option --ii or an interval, as de-
           scribed below), show the number of dropped packets.

     --ii    Show the state of interfaces which have been auto-configured (in-
           terfaces statically configured into a system, but not located at
           boot time are not shown).

     --II _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e
           Show information only about this interface; used with an _w_a_i_t in-
           terval as described below.

     --MM    Extract values associated with the name list from the specified
           core instead of the default _/_d_e_v_/_k_m_e_m.

     --mm    Show statistics recorded by the memory management routines (the
           network manages a private pool of memory buffers).

     --NN    Extract the name list from the specified system instead of the de-
           fault _/_v_m_u_n_i_x.

     --nn    Show network addresses as numbers (normally nneettssttaatt interprets ad-
           dresses and attempts to display them symbolically).  This option
           may be used with any of the display formats.

     --pp _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l
           Show statistics about _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l, which is either a well-known name
           for a protocol or an alias for it.  Some protocol names and aliases
           are listed in the file _/_e_t_c_/_p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l_s. A null response typically
           means that there are no interesting numbers to report.  The program
           will complain if _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l is unknown or if there is no statistics


           routine for it.

     --ss    Show per-protocol statistics.

     --rr    Show the routing tables.  When --ss is also present, show routing
           statistics instead.

     --ff _a_d_d_r_e_s_s___f_a_m_i_l_y
           Limit statistics or address control block reports to those of the
           specified _a_d_d_r_e_s_s _f_a_m_i_l_y. The following address families are recog-
           nized: _i_n_e_t, for AF_INET, _n_s, for AF_NS, and _u_n_i_x, for AF_UNIX.

     The default display, for active sockets, shows the local and remote ad-
     dresses, send and receive queue sizes (in bytes), protocol, and the in-
     ternal state of the protocol.  Address formats are of the form
     ``host.port'' or ``network.port'' if a socket's address specifies a net-
     work but no specific host address.  When known the host and network ad-
     dresses are displayed symbolically according to the data bases _/_e_t_c_/_h_o_s_t_s
     and _/_e_t_c_/_n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s, respectively.  If a symbolic name for an address is
     unknown, or if the --nn option is specified, the address is printed numeri-
     cally, according to the address family.  For more information regarding
     the Internet ``dot format,'' refer to inet(3)).  Unspecified, or ``wild-
     card'', addresses and ports appear as ``*''.

     The interface display provides a table of cumulative statistics regarding
     packets transferred, errors, and collisions.  The network addresses of
     the interface and the maximum transmission unit (``mtu'') are also dis-
     played.

     The routing table display indicates the available routes and their sta-
     tus.  Each route consists of a destination host or network and a gateway
     to use in forwarding packets.  The flags field shows the state of the
     route (``U'' if ``up''), whether the route is to a gateway (``G''),
     whether the route was created dynamically by a redirect (``D''), and
     whether the route has been modified by a redirect (``M'').  Direct routes
     are created for each interface attached to the local host; the gateway
     field for such entries shows the address of the outgoing interface.  The
     refcnt field gives the current number of active uses of the route.  Con-
     nection oriented protocols normally hold on to a single route for the du-
     ration of a connection while connectionless protocols obtain a route
     while sending to the same destination.  The use field provides a count of
     the number of packets sent using that route.  The interface entry indi-
     cates the network interface utilized for the route.

     When nneettssttaatt is invoked with a _w_a_i_t interval argument, it displays a run-
     ning count of statistics related to network interfaces.  This display
     consists of a column for the primary interface (the first interface found
     during autoconfiguration) and a column summarizing information for all
     interfaces.  The primary interface may be replaced with another interface
     with the --II option.  The first line of each screen of information con-
     tains a summary since the system was last rebooted.  Subsequent lines of
     output show values accumulated over the preceding interval.

     The notion of errors is ill-defined.

     Collisions mean something else for the IMP.
