       The  _a_r utility creates and maintains groups of files com-
       bined into an archive.  Once an archive has been  created,
       new   files  can  be  added  and  existing  files  can  be
       extracted, deleted, or replaced.

       Files are named in the  archive  by  a  single  component,
       i.e.,  if  a  file referenced by a path containing a slash
       (``/'') is archived it will be named by the last component
       of  that  path.  When matching paths listed on the command
       line against file names stored in the  archive,  only  the
       last component of the path will be compared.

       All  informational  and error messages use the path listed
       on the command line, if any was specified;  otherwise  the
       name  in  the  archive  is used.  If multiple files in the
       archive have the same name, and paths are  listed  on  the
       command line to ``select'' archive files for an operation,
       only the ffiirrsstt file with a matching name will be selected.

       The  normal  use of _a_r is for the creation and maintenance
       of libraries suitable for use with the loader (see _l_d(1)),
       although  it  is  not  restricted  to  this  purpose.  The
       options are as follows:

       -a     A positioning modifier used with the options -r and
              -m.   The  files  are  entered  or  moved aafftteerr the
              archive member _p_o_s_i_t_i_o_n, which must be specified.

       -b     A positioning modifier used with the options -r and
              -m.   The  files  are  entered  or moved bbeeffoorree the
              archive member _p_o_s_i_t_i_o_n, which must be specified.

       -c     Whenever an archive is  created,  an  informational
              message  to  that  effect  is  written  to standard
              error.  If the -c option is specified,  _a_r  creates
              the archive silently.

       -d     Delete the specified archive files.

       -i     Identical to the -b option.

       -m     Move   the   specified  archive  files  within  the
              archive.  If one of the options -a,  -b  or  -i  is
              specified,  the files are moved before or after the
              _p_o_s_i_t_i_o_n file in the archive.   If  none  of  those
              options  are  specified, the files are moved to the
              end of the archive.

       -o     Set the access and modification times of  extracted
              files  to the modification time of the file when it
              was entered into the archive.  This  will  fail  if
              the  user is not the owner of the extracted file or
              the super-user.

       -p     Write the contents of the specified  archive  files
              to the standard output.  If no files are specified,
              the contents of all the files in  the  archive  are
              written in the order they appear in the archive.

       -q     (Quickly)   append   the  specified  files  to  the
              archive.  If the  archive  does  not  exist  a  new
              archive  file  is created.  Much faster than the -r
              option, when creating  a  large  archive  piece-by-
              piece,  as  no checking is done to see if the files
              already exist in the archive.

       -r     Replace or add the specified files to the  archive.
              If the archive does not exist a new archive file is
              created.  Files that replace existing files do  not
              change  the  order of the files within the archive.
              New files are appended to the archive unless one of
              the options -a, -b or -i is specified.

       -T     Select  and/or  name archive members using only the
              first fifteen characters of the archive  member  or
              command  line file name.  The historic archive for-
              mat had sixteen bytes for the name, but  some  his-
              toric  archiver  and  loader  implementations  were
              unable to handle names that used the entire  space.
              This  means  that file names that are not unique in
              their first fifteen characters can subsequently  be
              confused.   A  warning  message  is  printed to the
              standard error output if any file names  are  trun-
              cated.  (See _a_r(5) for more information.)

       -t     List the specified files in the order in which they
              appear in the archive, each on a separate line.  If
              no  files  are  specified, all files in the archive

              are listed.

       -u     Update files.  When used with the -r option,  files
              in  the  archive  will be replaced only if the disk
              file has a newer modification time than the file in
              the  archive.   When used with the -x option, files
              in the  archive  will  be  extracted  only  if  the
              archive file has a newer modification time than the
              file on disk.

       -v     Provide verbose output.  When used with the -d, -m,
              -q  or -x options, _a_r gives a file-by-file descrip-
              tion of the archive modification.  This description
              consists  of  three,  white-space separated fields:
              the option letter, a  dash  (``-'')  and  the  file
              name.   When  used  with the -r option, _a_r displays
              the description as above, but the initial letter is
              an ``a'' if the file is added to the archive and an
              ``r'' if the file replaces a file  already  in  the
              archive.

              When  used  with  the  -p  option, the name of each
              printed file, enclosed  in  less-than  (``<'')  and
              greater-than  (``>'') characters, is written to the
              standard output before the contents of the file; it
              is preceded by a single newline character, and fol-
              lowed by two newline characters.

              When used with the -t option, _a_r displays  an  ``ls
              -l'' style listing of information about the members
              of the archive.  This listing  consists  of  eight,
              white-space  separated fields: the file permissions
              (see _s_t_r_m_o_d_e(3)), the decimal user and  group  ID's
              separated  by a single slash (``/''), the file size
              (in bytes), the  file  modification  time  (in  the
              _d_a_t_e(1) format ``%b %e %H:%M %Y''), and the name of
              the file.

       -x     Extract the  specified  archive  members  into  the
              files  named  by the command line arguments.  If no
              members are  specified,  all  the  members  of  the
              archive are extracted into the current directory.

              If  the  file  does not exist, it is created; if it
              does exist, the owner and group will be  unchanged.
              The file access and modification times are the time
              of the extraction (but see  the  -o  option).   The
              file  permissions  will be set to those of the file
              when it was entered into  the  archive;  this  will
              fail  if the user is not the owner of the extracted
              file or the super-user.

       By default, _a_r writes archives that  may  be  incompatible
       with  historic  archives,  as  the format used for storing
       archive members with names longer than fifteen  characters
       has  changed.   This implementation of _a_r is backward com-
       patible with previous versions of _a_r in that it  can  read
       and write (using the -T option) historic archives.  The -T
       option is provided for compatibility  only,  and  will  be
       deleted  in a future release.  See _a_r(5) for more informa-
       tion.
