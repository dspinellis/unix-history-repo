     LLaassttccoommmm gives information on previously executed commands.  With no ar-
     guments, llaassttccoommmm prints information about all the commands recorded dur-
     ing the current accounting file's lifetime.

     Option:

     --ff _f_i_l_e   Read from _f_i_l_e rather than the default accounting file.

     If called with arguments, only accounting entries with a matching _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
     name, _u_s_e_r name, or _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l name are printed.  So, for example:

	   lastcomm a.out root ttyd0

     would produce a listing of all the executions of commands named _a._o_u_t by
     user _r_o_o_t on the terminal _t_t_y_d_0.

     For each process entry, the following are printed.

	   The name of the user who ran the process.
	   Flags, as accumulated by the accounting facilities in the system.
	   The command name under which the process was called.
	   The amount of cpu time used by the process (in seconds).
	   The time the process exited.

     The flags are encoded as follows: ``S'' indicates the command was execut-
     ed by the super-user, ``F'' indicates the command ran after a fork, but
     without a following exec, ``C'' indicates the command was run in PDP-11
     compatibility mode (VAX only), ``D'' indicates the command terminated
     with the generation of a _c_o_r_e file, and ``X'' indicates the command was
     terminated with a signal.
