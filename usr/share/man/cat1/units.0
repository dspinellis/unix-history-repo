     _U_n_i_t_s converts quantities expressed in various standard
     scales to their equivalents in other scales.  It works
     interactively in this fashion:

	  _Y_o_u _h_a_v_e: inch
	  _Y_o_u _w_a_n_t: cm
	       * _2._5_4_0_0_0_e+_0_0
	       / _3._9_3_7_0_1_e-_0_1

     A quantity is specified as a multiplicative combination of
     units optionally preceded by a numeric multiplier.  Powers
     are indicated by suffixed positive integers, division by the
     usual sign:

	  _Y_o_u _h_a_v_e: 15 pounds force/in2
	  _Y_o_u _w_a_n_t: atm
	       * _1._0_2_0_6_9_e+_0_0
	       / _9._7_9_7_3_0_e-_0_1

     _U_n_i_t_s only does multiplicative scale changes.  Thus it can
     convert Kelvin to Rankine, but not Centigrade to Fahrenheit.
     Most familiar units, abbreviations, and metric prefixes are
     recognized, together with a generous leavening of exotica
     and a few constants of nature including:

	  pi   ratio of circumference to diameter
	  c    speed of light
	  e    charge on an electron
	  g    acceleration of gravity
	  force     same as g
	  mole Avogadro's number
	  water     pressure head per unit height of water
	  au   astronomical unit

     `Pound' is a unit of mass.  Compound names are run together,
     e.g. `lightyear'.	British units that differ from their US
     counterparts are prefixed thus: `brgallon'.  Currency is
     denoted `belgiumfranc', `britainpound', ...

     For a complete list of units, `cat /usr/share/misc/units'.
