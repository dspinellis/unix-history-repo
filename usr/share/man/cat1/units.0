       _U_n_i_t_s  converts  quantities  expressed in various standard
       scales to their equivalents in  other  scales.   It  works
       interactively in this fashion:

            _Y_o_u _h_a_v_e_: inch
            _Y_o_u _w_a_n_t_: cm
                 _* _2_._5_4_0_0_0_e_+_0_0
                 _/ _3_._9_3_7_0_1_e_-_0_1

       A quantity is specified as a multiplicative combination of
       units optionally preceded by a numeric multiplier.  Powers
       are  indicated  by suffixed positive integers, division by
       the usual sign:

            _Y_o_u _h_a_v_e_: 15 pounds force/in2
            _Y_o_u _w_a_n_t_: atm
                 _* _1_._0_2_0_6_9_e_+_0_0
                 _/ _9_._7_9_7_3_0_e_-_0_1

       _U_n_i_t_s only does multiplicative scale changes.  Thus it can
       convert  Kelvin  to Rankine, but not Centigrade to Fahren-
       heit.  Most familiar units, abbreviations, and metric pre-
       fixes  are  recognized, together with a generous leavening
       of exotica and a few constants of nature including:

            pi   ratio of circumference to diameter
            c    speed of light
            e    charge on an electron
            g    acceleration of gravity
            force     same as g
            mole Avogadro's number
            water     pressure head per unit height of water
            au   astronomical unit

       `Pound' is  a  unit  of  mass.   Compound  names  are  run
       together,  e.g.  `lightyear'.   British  units that differ
       from their US counterparts are prefixed thus:  `brgallon'.
       Currency is denoted `belgiumfranc', `britainpound', ...

       For a complete list of units, `cat /usr/share/misc/units'.
