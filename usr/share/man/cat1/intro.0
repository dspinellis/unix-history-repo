     Section one of the manual contains most of the commands which comprise
     the BSD user enviroment.  Some of the commands included in section one
     are text editors, command shell interpreters, searching and sorting
     tools, file manipulation commands system status commands, remote file
     copy commands, mail commands, compilers and compiler tools, formatted
     output tools, and line printer commands.

     All commands set a status value upon exit which may be tested to see if
     the command completed normally.  The exit values and their meanings are
     explained in the individual manuals.  Traditionally, the value 0 signi-
     fies successful completetion of the command.
