     AAmmqq provides a simple way of determining the current state of the amd(8)
     program.  Communication is by RPC. Three modes of operation are supported
     by the current protocol.  By default a list of mount points and auto-
     mounted filesystems is output.  An alternative host can be specified us-
     ing the --hh option.

     If directory names are given, as output by default, then per-filesystem
     information is displayed.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     --ff      Request automounter to flush the internal caches.

     --hh _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e
             Query alternate host _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e. By default the local host is used.
             In an HP-UX cluster, the root server is queried by default, since
             that is the system on which the automounter is normally run.

     --mm      Request the automounter to provide a list of mounted filesystems,
             including the number of references to each filesystem and any er-
             ror which occured while mounting.

     --ss      Request the automounter to provide system-wide mount statistics.

     --uu      Request the automounter to unmount the named filesystems instead
             of providing information about them.  Unmounts are requested, not
             forced.  They merely cause the mounted filesystem to timeout,
             which will be picked up by amd's  main scheduler thus causing the
             normal timeout action to be taken.

     --vv      Request the automounter to provide version information.  This is
             a subset of the information provided by amd's

     --vv      option.

     --MM      Request automounter to add the given map entry to the root map
             and then trigger a mount request for it.

     AAmmqq uses a Sun registered RPC program number (300019 decimal) which may
     not be in the _/_e_t_c_/_r_p_c database.
