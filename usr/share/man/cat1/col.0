     CCooll filters out reverse (and half reverse) line feeds so that the output
     is in the correct order and contains only forward and half forward line
     feeds, and replaces white-space characters with tabs where possible.
     This can be useful in processing the output of nroff(1) and tbl(1).

     CCooll reads from standard input and writes to standard output.

     The options are as follows:

     --bb        Do not output any backspaces - print only the last character
	       written to each column position.

     --ff        Forward half line feeds are permitted (``fine'' mode).  Normal-
	       ly characters printed on a half line boundary are printed on
	       the following line.

     --xx        Output multiple spaces instead of tabs.

     --ll_n_u_m     Buffer at least _n_u_m lines in memory.  By default, 128 lines are
	       buffered.

     The control sequences for carriage motion that ccooll understands and their
     decimal values are listed in the following table:

     ESC-7	       reverse line feed (escape then 7)
     ESC-8	       half reverse line feed (escape then 8)
     ESC-9	       half forward line feed (escape then 9)
     backspace	       moves back one column (8); ignored in the first column
     carriage return   (13)
     newline	       forward line feed (10); also does carriage return
     shift in	       shift to normal character set (15)
     shift out	       shift to alternate character set (14)
     space	       moves forward one column (32)
     tab	       moves forward to next tab stop (9)
     vertical tab      reverse line feed (11)


     All unrecognized control characters and escape sequences are discarded.

     CCooll keeps track of the character set as characters are read and makes
     sure the character set is correct when they are output.

     If the input attempts to back up to the last flushed line, ccooll will
     display a warning message.

     A ccooll command appeared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.  The BSD ccooll is derived
     from code written by Michael Rendell.
