DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     LLeexx is a tool for generating _s_c_a_n_n_e_r_s: programs which recognized lexical
     patterns in text.	LLeexx reads the given input files, or its standard input
     if no file names are given, for a description of a scanner to generate.
     The description is in the form of pairs of regular expressions and C
     code, called _r_u_l_e_s.  LLeexx generates as output a C source file, _l_e_x._y_y._c,
     which defines a routine yyyylleexx().  This file is compiled and linked with
     the --llffll library to produce an executable.  When the executable is run,
     it analyzes its input for occurrences of the regular expressions.	When-
     ever it finds one, it executes the corresponding C code.

     For full documentation, see _L_e_x_d_o_c.  This manual entry is intended for
     use as a quick reference.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     LLeexx has the following options:

     --bb    Generate backtracking information to _l_e_x._b_a_c_k_t_r_a_c_k.	This is a list
	   of scanner states which require backtracking and the input charac-
	   ters on which they do so.  By adding rules one can remove back-
	   tracking states.  If all backtracking states are eliminated and --ff
	   or --FF is used, the generated scanner will run faster.

     --cc    is a do-nothing, deprecated option included for POSIX compliance.

	   _N_O_T_E: in previous releases of LLeexx [--cc] specified table-compression
	   options.  This functionality is now given by the --CC flag.  To ease
	   the the impact of this change, when lleexx encounters --cc,, it currently
	   issues a warning message and assumes that --CC was desired instead.
	   In the future this "promotion" of --cc to --CC will go away in the name
	   of full POSIX compliance (unless the POSIX meaning is removed
	   first).

     --dd    makes the generated scanner run in _d_e_b_u_g mode.  Whenever a pattern
	   is recognized and the global _y_y__L_e_x__d_e_b_u_g is non-zero (which is the
	   default), the scanner will write to stderr a line of the form:

		 --accepting rule at line 53 ("the matched text")

	   The line number refers to the location of the rule in the file de-
	   fining the scanner (i.e., the file that was fed to lex).  Messages
	   are also generated when the scanner backtracks, accepts the default
	   rule, reaches the end of its input buffer (or encounters a NUL; the
	   two look the same as far as the scanner's concerned), or reaches an
	   end-of-file.

     --ff    specifies (take your pick) _f_u_l_l _t_a_b_l_e or _f_a_s_t _s_c_a_n_n_e_r.  No table
	   compression is done.  The result is large but fast.	This option is
	   equivalent to --CCff (see below).

     --ii    instructs lleexx to generate a _c_a_s_e-_i_n_s_e_n_s_i_t_i_v_e scanner.  The case of
	   letters given in the lleexx input patterns will be ignored, and tokens
	   in the input will be matched regardless of case.  The matched text
	   given in _y_y_t_e_x_t will have the preserved case (i.e., it will not be
	   folded).

     --nn    is another do-nothing, deprecated option included only for POSIX
	   compliance.
     --pp    generates a performance report to stderr.  The report consists of
	   comments regarding features of the lleexx input file which will cause
	   a loss of performance in the resulting scanner.

     --ss    causes the _d_e_f_a_u_l_t _r_u_l_e (that unmatched scanner input is echoed to
	   _s_t_d_o_u_t) to be suppressed.  If the scanner encounters input that
	   does not match any of its rules, it aborts with an error.

     --tt    instructs lleexx to write the scanner it generates to standard output
	   instead of _l_e_x._y_y._c.

     --vv    specifies that lleexx should write to stderr a summary of statistics
	   regarding the scanner it generates.

     --FF    specifies that the _f_a_s_t scanner table representation should be
	   used.  This representation is about as fast as the full table
	   representation (--ff), and for some sets of patterns will be consid-
	   erably smaller (and for others, larger).  See _L_e_x_d_o_c for details.

	   This option is equivalent to --CCFF (see below).

     --II    instructs lleexx to generate an _i_n_t_e_r_a_c_t_i_v_e scanner, that is, a
	   scanner which stops immediately rather than looking ahead if it
	   knows that the currently scanned text cannot be part of a longer
	   rule's match.  Again, see _L_e_x_d_o_c for details.

	   Note, --II cannot be used in conjunction with _f_u_l_l or _f_a_s_t _t_a_b_l_e_s,
	   i.e., the --ff, --FF, --CCff, or --CCFF flags.

     --LL    instructs lleexx not to generate #line directives in _l_e_x._y_y._c.	The
	   default is to generate such directives so error messages in the ac-
	   tions will be correctly located with respect to the original lleexx
	   input file, and not to the fairly meaningless line numbers of
	   _l_e_x._y_y._c.

     --TT    makes lleexx run in _t_r_a_c_e mode.  It will generate a lot of messages to
	   stdout concerning the form of the input and the resultant non-
	   deterministic and deterministic finite automata.  This option is
	   mostly for use in maintaining lleexx.

     --88    instructs lleexx to generate an 8-bit scanner.	On some sites, this is
	   the default.  On others, the default is 7-bit characters.  To see
	   which is the case, check the verbose (--vv) output for "equivalence
	   classes created".  If the denominator of the number shown is 128,
	   then by default lleexx is generating 7-bit characters.	If it is 256,
	   then the default is 8-bit characters.

     --CC[eeffmmFF]
	   controls the degree of table compression. The default setting is
	   --CCeemm.

	   --CC	 A lone --CC specifies that the scanner tables should be
		 compressed but neither equivalence classes nor meta-
		 equivalence classes should be used.

	   --CCee	 directs lleexx to construct _e_q_u_i_v_a_l_e_n_c_e _c_l_a_s_s_e_s, i.e., sets of
		 characters which have identical lexical properties.
		 Equivalence classes usually give dramatic reductions in the
		 final table/object file sizes (typically a factor of 2-5) and
		 are pretty cheap performance-wise (one array look-up per
		 character scanned).

	   --CCff	 specifies that the _f_u_l_l scanner tables should be generated -
		 lleexx should not compress the tables by taking advantages of
		 similar transition functions for different states.

	   --CCFF	 specifies that the alternate fast scanner representation
		 (described in _L_e_x_d_o_c) should be used.

	   --CCmm	 directs lleexx to construct _m_e_t_a-_e_q_u_i_v_a_l_e_n_c_e _c_l_a_s_s_e_s, which are
		 sets of equivalence classes (or characters, if equivalence
		 classes are not being used) that are commonly used together.
		 Meta-equivalence classes are often a big win when using
		 compressed tables, but they have a moderate performance im-
		 pact (one or two "if" tests and one array look-up per charac-
		 ter scanned).

	   --CCeemm
		 (default) Generate both equivalence classes and meta-
		 equivalence classes.  This setting provides the highest de-
		 gree of table compression.

	   Faster-executing scanners can be traded off at the cost of larger
	   tables with the following generally being true:

			    slowest & smallest
				  -Cem
				  -Cm
				  -Ce
				  -C
				  -C{f,F}e
				  -C{f,F}
			    fastest & largest

	   --CC options are not cumulative; whenever the flag is encountered,
	   the previous -C settings are forgotten.

	   The options --CCff or --CCFF and --CCmm do not make sense together - there
	   is no opportunity for meta-equivalence classes if the table is not
	   being compressed.  Otherwise the options may be freely mixed.

     --SS_s_k_e_l_e_t_o_n__f_i_l_e
	   overrides the default skeleton file from which lleexx constructs its
	   scanners.  Useful for lleexx maintenance or development.

     The patterns in the input are written using an extended set of regular
     expressions.  These are:

     x	     match the character 'x'
     .	     any character except newline
     [xyz]   a "character class"; in this case, the pattern matches either an
	     'x', a 'y', or a 'z'
     [abj-oZ]
	     a "character class" with a range in it; matches an 'a', a 'b',
	     any letter from 'j' through 'o', or a 'Z'
     [Li ^A-Z]
	     a "negated character class", i.e., any character but those in the
	     class.  In this case, any character EXCEPT an uppercase letter.
     [Li ^A-Z\n]
	     any character EXCEPT an uppercase letter or a newline
     r*      zero or more r's, where r is any regular expression
     r+      one or more r's
     r?      zero or one r's (that is, "an optional r")
     r{2,5}
	     anywhere from two to five r's
     r{2,}   two or more r's
     r{4}    exactly 4 r's
     {name}
	     the expansion of the "name" definition (see above)
     [xyz]\"foo"
	     the literal string: [xyz]"foo
     \X      if X is an 'a', 'b', 'f', 'n', 'r', 't', or 'v', then the ANSI-C
	     interpretation of \x.  Otherwise, a literal 'X' (used to escape
	     operators such as '*')
     \123    the character with octal value 123
     \x2a    the character with hexadecimal value 2a
     (r)     match an r; parentheses are used to override precedence (see
	     below)
     rs      the regular expression r followed by the regular expression s;
	     called "concatenation"
     rs      either an r or an s
     r/s     an r but only if it is followed by an s.  The s is not part of
	     the matched text.	This type of pattern is called as "trailing
	     context".
     ^r      an r, but only at the beginning of a line
     r$      an r, but only at the end of a line.  Equivalent to "r/\n".
     <s>r    an r, but only in start condition s (see below for discussion of
	     start conditions)
     <s1,s2,s3>r
	     same, but in any of start conditions s1, s2, or s3
     <<EOF>>
	     an end-of-file
     <s1,s2><<EOF>>
	     an end-of-file when in start condition s1 or s2

     The regular expressions listed above are grouped according to precedence,
     from highest precedence at the top to lowest at the bottom.  Those
     grouped together have equal precedence.

     Some notes on patterns:

     Negated character classes _m_a_t_c_h _n_e_w_l_i_n_e_s unless "\n" (or an equivalent
     escape sequence) is one of the characters explicitly present in the
     negated character class (e.g., " [^A-Z\n] ").

     A rule can have at most one instance of trailing context (the '/' opera-
     tor or the '$' operator).	The start condition, '^', and "<<EOF>>" pat-
     terns can only occur at the beginning of a pattern, and, as well as with
     '/' and '$', cannot be grouped inside parentheses.  The following are all
     illegal:

		       foo/bar$
		       foo(bar$)
		       foo^bar
		       <sc1>foo<sc2>bar

     In addition to arbitrary C code, the following can appear in actions:

     EECCHHOO      Copies _y_y_t_e_x_t to the scanner's output.

     BBEEGGIINN     Followed by the name of a start condition places the scanner in
	       the corresponding start condition.

     RREEJJEECCTT    Directs the scanner to proceed on to the "second best" rule
	       which matched the input (or a prefix of the input).  _y_y_t_e_x_t and
	       _y_y_l_e_n_g are set up appropriately.  Note that RREEJJEECCTT is a partic-
	       ularly expensive feature in terms scanner performance; if it is
	       used in _a_n_y of the scanner's actions it will slow down _a_l_l of
	       the scanner's matching.	Furthermore, RREEJJEECCTT cannot be used
	       with the --ff or --FF options.

	       Note also that unlike the other special actions, RREEJJEECCTT is a
	       _b_r_a_n_c_h; code immediately following it in the action will _n_o_t be
	       executed.

     yyyymmoorree()
	       tells the scanner that the next time it matches a rule, the
	       corresponding token should be _a_p_p_e_n_d_e_d onto the current value
	       of _y_y_t_e_x_t rather than replacing it.

     yyyylleessss(_n)
	       returns all but the first _n characters of the current token
	       back to the input stream, where they will be rescanned when the
	       scanner looks for the next match.  _y_y_t_e_x_t and _y_y_l_e_n_g are ad-
	       justed appropriately (e.g., _y_y_l_e_n_g will now be equal to _n).

     uunnppuutt(_c)
	       puts the character _c back onto the input stream.  It will be
	       the next character scanned.

     iinnppuutt()   reads the next character from the input stream (this routine is
	       called yyyyiinnppuutt() if the scanner is compiled using _C ++).

     yyyytteerrmmiinnaattee()
	       can be used in lieu of a return statement in an action.	It
	       terminates the scanner and returns a 0 to the scanner's caller,
	       indicating "all done".

	       By default, yyyytteerrmmiinnaattee() is also called when an end-of-file is
	       encountered.  It is a macro and may be redefined.

     YYYY__NNEEWW__FFIILLEE
	       is an action available only in <<EOF>> rules.  It means "Okay,
	       I've set up a new input file, continue scanning".

     yyyy__ccrreeaattee__bbuuffffeerr(_f_i_l_e, _s_i_z_e)
	       takes a FFIILLEE pointer and an integer _s_i_z_e.  It returns a
	       YY_BUFFER_STATE handle to a new input buffer large enough to
	       accomodate _s_i_z_e characters and associated with the given file.
	       When in doubt, use _Y_Y__B_U_F__S_I_Z_E for the size.

     yyyy__sswwiittcchh__ttoo__bbuuffffeerr(_n_e_w__b_u_f_f_e_r)
	       switches the scanner's processing to scan for tokens from the
	       given buffer, which must be a YY_BUFFER_STATE.

     yyyy__ddeelleettee__bbuuffffeerr(_b_u_f_f_e_r)
	       deletes the given buffer.

     _c_h_a_r *_y_y_t_e_x_t

     _i_n_t _y_y_l_e_n_g
	       holds the length of the current token.  It may not be modified.

     _F_I_L_E *_y_y_i_n
	       is the file which by default lleexx reads from.  It may be rede-
	       fined but doing so only makes sense before scanning begins.
	       Changing it in the middle of scanning will have unexpected
	       results since lleexx buffers its input.  Once scanning terminates

     _F_I_L_E *_y_y_o_u_t

     _Y_Y__C_U_R_R_E_N_T__B_U_F_F_E_R

     _Y_Y__D_E_C_L   controls how the scanning routine is declared.  By default, it
	       is "int yylex()", or, if prototypes are being used, "int
	       yylex(void)".  This definition may be changed by redefining the
	       "YY_DECL" macro.  Note that if you give arguments to the scan-
	       ning routine using a K&R-style/non-prototyped function declara-
	       tion, you must terminate the definition with a semi-colon (;).

     _Y_Y__I_N_P_U_T
	       The nature of how the scanner gets its input can be controlled
	       by redefining the YY_INPUT macro.  YY_INPUT's calling sequence
	       is "YY_INPUT(buf,result,max_size)".  Its action is to place up
	       to _m_a_x __s_i_z_e characters in the character array _b_u_f and return
	       in the integer variable _r_e_s_u_l_t either the number of characters
	       read or the constant YY_NULL (0 on Unix systems) to indicate
	       EOF.  The default YY_INPUT reads from the global file-pointer
	       "yyin".	A sample redefinition of YY_INPUT (in the definitions
	       section of the input file):

		     %{
		     #undef YY_INPUT
		     #define YY_INPUT(buf,result,max_size) \
			 result = ((buf[0] = getchar()) == EOF) ? YY_NULL : 1;
		     %}

     _Y_Y__I_N_P_U_T
	       When the scanner receives an end-of-file indication from
	       YY_INPUT, it then checks the yyyywwrraapp() function.	If yyyywwrraapp()
	       returns false (zero), then it is assumed that the function has
	       gone ahead and set up _y_y_i_n to point to another input file, and
	       scanning continues.  If it returns true (non-zero), then the
	       scanner terminates, returning 0 to its caller.

     _y_y_w_r_a_p    The default yyyywwrraapp() always returns 1.  Presently, to redefine
	       it you must first "#undef yywrap", as it is currently imple-
	       mented as a macro.  It is likely that yyyywwrraapp() will soon be de-
	       fined to be a function rather than a macro.

     _Y_Y__U_S_E_R__A_C_T_I_O_N
	       can be redefined to provide an action which is always executed
	       prior to the matched rule's action.

     _Y_Y__U_S_E_R__I_N_I_T
	       The macro _Y_Y __U_S_E_R__I_N_I_T may be redefined to provide an action
	       which is always executed before the first scan.

     _Y_Y__B_R_E_A_K
	       In the generated scanner, the actions are all gathered in one
	       large switch statement and separated using _Y_Y __B_R_E_A_K, which may
	       be redefined.  By default, it is simply a "break", to separate
	       each rule's action from the following rule's.

     reject_used_but_not_detected undefined
	       or
     yymore_used_but_not_detected undefined
	       These errors can occur at compile time.	They indicate that the
	       scanner uses RREEJJEECCTT or yyyymmoorree() but that lleexx failed to notice
	       the fact, meaning that lleexx scanned the first two sections look-
	       ing for occurrences of these actions and failed to find any,
	       but somehow you snuck some in  via a #include file, for example
	       .  Make an explicit reference to the action in your lleexx input
	       file.  Note that previously lleexx supported a %used/%unused
	       mechanism for dealing with this problem; this feature is still
	       supported but now deprecated, and will go away soon unless the
	       author hears from people who can argue compellingly that they
	       need it.

     lex scanner jammed
	       a scanner compiled with --ss has encountered an input string
	       which wasn't matched by any of its rules.

     lex input buffer overflowed
	       a scanner rule matched a string long enough to overflow the
	       scanner's internal input buffer	16K bytes - controlled by
	       _Y_Y__B_U_F__M_A_X in _l_e_x._s_k_e_l.

     scanner requires -8 flag
	       Your scanner specification includes recognizing 8-bit charac-
	       ters and you did not specify the -8 flag  and your site has not
	       installed lex with -8 as the default .

     too many %t classes!
	       You managed to put every single character into its own %t
	       class.  LLeexx requires that at least one of the classes share
	       characters.

     Some trailing context patterns cannot be properly matched and generate
     warning messages ("Dangerous trailing context").  These are patterns
     where the ending of the first part of the rule matches the beginning of
     the second part, such as "zx*/xy*", where the 'x*' matches the 'x' at the
     beginning of the trailing context.  (Note that the POSIX draft states
     that the text matched by such patterns is undefined.)

     For some trailing context rules, parts which are actually fixed-length
     are not recognized as such, leading to the abovementioned performance
     loss.  In particular, parts using '|' or {n} (such as "foo{3}") are al-
     ways considered variable-length.

     Combining trailing context with the special '|' action can result in
     _f_i_x_e_d trailing context being turned into the more expensive _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e
     trailing context.	This happens in the following example:

		       %%
		       abc  |
		       xyz/def

     Use of uunnppuutt() invalidates yytext and yyleng.


     Use of uunnppuutt() to push back more text than was matched can result in the
     pushed-back text matching a beginning-of-line ('^') rule even though it
     didn't come at the beginning of the line (though this is rare!).

     Pattern-matching of NUL's is substantially slower than matching other
     characters.

     LLeexx does not generate correct #line directives for code internal to the
     scanner; thus, bugs in _l_e_x._s_k_e_l yield bogus line numbers.

     Due to both buffering of input and read-ahead, you cannot intermix calls
     to <stdio.h> routines, such as, for example, ggeettcchhaarr(), with lleexx rules
     and expect it to work.  Call iinnppuutt() instead.

     The total table entries listed by the --vv flag excludes the number of
     table entries needed to determine what rule has been matched.  The number
     of entries is equal to the number of DFA states if the scanner does not
     use RREEJJEECCTT, and somewhat greater than the number of states if it does.

     RREEJJEECCTT cannot be used with the --ff or --FF options.

     Some of the macros, such as yyyywwrraapp(), may in the future become functions
     which live in the --llffll library.  This will doubtless break a lot of code,
     but may be required for POSIX-compliance.

     The lleexx internal algorithms need documentation.
