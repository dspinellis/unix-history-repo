     UUll reads the named files (or standard input if none are given) and trans-
     lates occurrences of underscores to the sequence which indicates under-
     lining for the terminal in use, as specified by the environment variable
     TERM. The file _/_e_t_c_/_t_e_r_m_c_a_p is read to determine the appropriate se-
     quences for underlining.  If the terminal is incapable of underlining,
     but is capable of a standout mode then that is used instead.  If the ter-
     minal can overstrike, or handles underlining automatically, uull degener-
     ates to cat(1).  If the terminal cannot underline, underlining is ig-
     nored.

     The following options are available:

     --ii      Underlining is indicated by a separate line containing appropri-
             ate dashes `-'; this is useful when you want to look at the un-
             derlining which is present in an nroff output stream on a crt-
             terminal.

     --tt _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l
             Overrides the terminal type specified in the environment with
             _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l.

     The following environment variable is used:

     TERM  The TERM variable is used to relate a tty device with its device
           capability description (see termcap(5)).  TERM is set at login
           time, either by the default terminal type specified in _/_e_t_c_/_t_t_y_s or
           as set during the login process by the user in their _l_o_g_i_n file
           (see setenv(1)).

     Nroff usually outputs a series of backspaces and underlines intermixed
     with the text to indicate underlining.  No attempt is made to optimize
     the backward motion.

     The uull command appeared in 3.0BSD.
