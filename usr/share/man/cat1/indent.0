DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     IInnddeenntt is a _C program formatter.  It reformats the _C program in the
     _i_n_p_u_t-_f_i_l_e according to the switches.  The switches which can be speci-
     fied are described below. They may appear before or after the file names.

     NNOOTTEE: If you only specify an _i_n_p_u_t-_f_i_l_e, the formatting is done `in-
     place', that is, the formatted file is written back into _i_n_p_u_t-_f_i_l_e and a
     backup copy of _i_n_p_u_t-_f_i_l_e is written in the current directory.  If
     _i_n_p_u_t-_f_i_l_e is named `/_b_l_a_h/_b_l_a_h/_f_i_l_e', the backup file is named _f_i_l_e._B_A_K.

     If _o_u_t_p_u_t-_f_i_l_e is specified, iinnddeenntt checks to make sure it is different
     from _i_n_p_u_t-_f_i_l_e.

     The options listed below control the formatting style imposed by iinnddeenntt.

     --bbaadd, --nnbbaadd   If --bbaadd is specified, a blank line is forced after every
		   block of declarations.  Default: --nnbbaadd.

     --bbaapp, --nnbbaapp   If --bbaapp is specified, a blank line is forced after every
		   procedure body.  Default: --nnbbaapp.

     --bbbbbb, --nnbbbbbb   If --bbbbbb is specified, a blank line is forced before every
		   block comment.  Default: --nnbbbbbb.

     --bbcc, --nnbbcc	   If --bbcc is specified, then a newline is forced after each
		   comma in a declaration.  --nnbbcc turns off this option.  The
		   default is --bbcc.

     --bbrr, --bbll	   Specifying --bbll lines up compound statements like this:
			 if (...)
			 {
			   code
			 }
		   Specifying --bbrr (the default) makes them look like this:
			 if (...) {
			   code
			 }

     --cc --nn	   The column in which comments on code start.	The default is
		   33.

     --ccdd --nn	   The column in which comments on declarations start.	The
		   default is for these comments to start in the same column
		   as those on code.

     --ccddbb, --nnccddbb   Enables (disables) the placement of comment delimiters on
		   blank lines.  With this option enabled, comments look like
		   this:
			      /*
			      * this is a comment
			      */
		   Rather than like this:
			      /* this is a comment */
		   This only affects block comments, not comments to the right
		   of code.  The default is --ccddbb.

     --ccee, --nnccee	   Enables (disables) forcing `else's to cuddle up to the im-
		   mediately preceding `}'.  The default is --ccee.

     --ccii_n	   Sets the continuation indent to be _n.  Continuation lines
		   will be indented that far from the beginning of the first
		   line of the statement.  Parenthesized expressions have ex-
		   tra indentation added to indicate the nesting, unless --llpp
		   is in effect.  --ccii defaults to the same value as --ii.

     --ccllii_n	   Causes case labels to be indented _n tab stops to the right
		   of the containing sswwiittcchh statement.	--ccllii00 --..55 causes case
		   labels to be indented half a tab stop.  The default is
		   --ccllii00.

     --dd_n	   Controls the placement of comments which are not to the
		   right of code.  The default --dd11 means that such comments
		   are placed one indentation level to the left of code.
		   Specifying --dd00 lines up these comments with the code.  See
		   the section on comment indentation below.

     --ddii_n	   Specifies the indentation, in character positions, from a
		   declaration keyword to the following identifier.  The
		   default is --ddii1166.

     --ddjj, --nnddjj	   --ddjj left justifies declarations.  --nnddjj indents declarations
		   the same as code.  The default is --nnddjj.

     --eeii, --nneeii	   Enables (disables) special eellssee--iiff processing.  If it's en-
		   abled, an iiff following an eellssee will have the same indenta-
		   tion as the preceding iiff statement.

     --ffcc11, --nnffcc11   Enables (disables) the formatting of comments that start in
		   column 1.  Often, comments whose leading `/' is in column 1
		   have been carefully hand formatted by the programmer.  In
		   such cases, --nnffcc11 should be used.  The default is --ffcc11.

     --ii_n	   The number of spaces for one indentation level.  The
		   default is 4.

     --iipp, --nniipp	   Enables (disables) the indentation of parameter declara-
		   tions from the left margin.	The default is --iipp.

     --ll_n	   Maximum length of an output line.  The default is 75.

     --llpp, --nnllpp	   Lines up code surrounded by parenthesis in continuation
		   lines.  If a line has a left paren which is not closed on
		   that line, then continuation lines will be lined up to
		   start at the character position just after the left paren.
		   For example, here is how a piece of continued code looks
		   with --nnllpp in effect:
			 p1 = first_procedure(second_procedure(p2, p3),
			   third_procedure(p4,p5));
		   With --llpp in effect (the default) the code looks somewhat
		   clearer:
			 p1 = first_procedure(second_procedure(p2, p3),
					      third_procedure(p4,p5));
		   Inserting two more newlines we get:
			 p1 = first_procedure(second_procedure(p2,
							       p3),
					      third_procedure(p4
							      p5));

     --nnpprroo	   Causes the profile files, `./._i_n_d_e_n_t._p_r_o' and
		   `~/._i_n_d_e_n_t._p_r_o', to be ignored.
     --ppccss, --nnppccss   If true (--ppccss) all procedure calls will have a space in-
		   serted between the name and the `('.  The default is --nnppccss.

     --ppssll, --nnppssll   If true (--ppssll) the names of procedures being defined are
		   placed in column 1 - their types, if any, will be left on
		   the previous lines.	The default is --ppssll.

     --sscc, --nnsscc	   Enables (disables) the placement of asterisks (`*'s) at the
		   left edge of all comments.

     --ssoobb, --nnssoobb   If --ssoobb is specified, indent will swallow optional blank
		   lines.  You can use this to get rid of blank lines after
		   declarations.  Default: --nnssoobb.

     --sstt	   Causes iinnddeenntt to take its input from stdin, and put its
		   output to stdout.

     --TT_t_y_p_e_n_a_m_e    Adds _t_y_p_e_n_a_m_e to the list of type keywords.	Names accumu-
		   late: --TT can be specified more than once.  You need to
		   specify all the typenames that appear in your program that
		   are defined by ttyyppeeddeeff - nothing will be harmed if you miss
		   a few, but the program won't be formatted as nicely as it
		   should.  This sounds like a painful thing to have to do,
		   but it's really a symptom of a problem in C: ttyyppeeddeeff causes
		   a syntactic change in the language and iinnddeenntt can't find
		   all instances of ttyyppeeddeeff.

     --ttrrooffff	   Causes iinnddeenntt to format the program for processing by
		   troff.  It will produce a fancy listing in much the same
		   spirit as vgrind(1).  If the output file is not specified,
		   the default is standard output, rather than formatting in
		   place.

     --vv, --nnvv	   --vv turns on `verbose' mode; --nnvv turns it off.  When in ver-
		   bose mode, iinnddeenntt reports when it splits one line of input
		   into two or more lines of output, and gives some size
		   statistics at completion. The default is --nnvv.

     You may set up your own `profile' of defaults to iinnddeenntt by creating a
     file called ._i_n_d_e_n_t._p_r_o in your login directory and/or the current direc-
     tory and including whatever switches you like.  A `.indent.pro' in the
     current directory takes precedence over the one in your login directory.
     If iinnddeenntt is run and a profile file exists, then it is read to set up the
     program's defaults.  Switches on the command line, though, always over-
     ride profile switches.  The switches should be separated by spaces, tabs
     or newlines.

  CCoommmmeennttss
     `_B_o_x' _c_o_m_m_e_n_t_s.  IInnddeenntt assumes that any comment with a dash or star im-
     mediately after the start of comment (that is, `/*-' or `/**') is a com-
     ment surrounded by a box of stars.  Each line of such a comment is left
     unchanged, except that its indentation may be adjusted to account for the
     change in indentation of the first line of the comment.

     _S_t_r_a_i_g_h_t _t_e_x_t.  All other comments are treated as straight text.  IInnddeenntt
     fits as many words (separated by blanks, tabs, or newlines) on a line as
     possible.	Blank lines break paragraphs.

  CCoommmmeenntt iinnddeennttaattiioonn
     If a comment is on a line with code it is started in the `comment
     column', which is set by the --cc_n command line parameter.  Otherwise, the
     comment is started at _n indentation levels less than where code is
     currently being placed, where _n is specified by the --dd_n command line
     parameter.  If the code on a line extends past the comment column, the
     comment starts further to the right, and the right margin may be
     automatically extended in extreme cases.
  PPrreepprroocceessssoorr lliinneess
     In general, iinnddeenntt leaves preprocessor lines alone.  The only reformat-
     ting that it will do is to straighten up trailing comments.  It leaves
     embedded comments alone.  Conditional compilation (##iiffddeeff......##eennddiiff) is
     recognized and iinnddeenntt attempts to correctly compensate for the syntactic
     peculiarities introduced.

  CC ssyynnttaaxx
     IInnddeenntt understands a substantial amount about the syntax of C, but it has
     a `forgiving' parser.  It attempts to cope with the usual sorts of incom-
     plete and misformed syntax.  In particular, the use of macros like:
	   #define forever for(;;)
     is handled properly.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     IInnddeenntt uses the HOME environment variable.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     IInnddeenntt appeared in 4.2 BSD.

BBUUGGSS
     IInnddeenntt has even more switches than ls(1).

     A common mistake that often causes grief is typing:
	   indent *.c
     to the shell in an attempt to indent all the CC programs in a directory.
     This is probably a bug, not a feature.
