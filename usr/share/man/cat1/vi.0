     VVii (visual) is a display oriented text editor based on ex(1).  Ex and vvii
     run the same code; it is possible to get to the command mode of ex from
     within vvii and vice-versa.

     VViieeww is the same as ``vi -R'', e.g. run in read-only mode.

     Available options:

     --RR         Read only. Changes to the file may not be written out.

     --ll         Sets options for editing LISP source (options sshhoowwmmaattcchh and
                lliisspp).

     --rr         In the event of an editor or system crash, the --rr option will
                retrieve the last saved version of the specified file, or if
                no file is specified, a list of saved files is printed.

     --tt _t_a_g     If tags are used (see ctags(1))  the editor is postioned at
                _t_a_g.

     --ww_n        The default window size is set to _n.

     ++_c_o_m_m_a_n_d   Enter the file with _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_. Useful for positioning on a
                string or line number.

     The _V_i _Q_u_i_c_k _R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e card and the _I_n_t_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n _t_o _D_i_s_p_l_a_y _E_d_i_t_i_n_g _w_i_t_h
     _V_i provide full details on using vvii.

     The vvii command uses the following environment variables.

     EXINIT      User specified startup values for ex and vvii. Usually speci-
                 fied in the file _~_/_._e_x_r_c

     HOME        Default directory to search for the file _~_/_._e_x_r_c

     SHELL       Shell used for _e_s_c_a_p_e_d commands (with the ex ::!! command).

     TERM        Terminal type used to lookup terminal capabilities from the
                 file _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_m_i_s_c_/_t_e_r_m_c_a_p.

     TERMCAP     If set, specifies an alternate termcap file.

BBUUGGSS
     Software tabs using ^^TT work only immediately after the aauuttooiinnddeenntt.

     Left and right shifts on intelligent terminals don't make use of insert
     and delete character operations in the terminal.

     The wwrraappmmaarrggiinn option can be fooled since it looks at output columns when
     blanks are typed.  If a long word passes through the margin and onto the
     next line without a break, then the line won't be broken.

     Insert/delete within a line can be slow if tabs are present on intelli-
     gent terminals, since the terminals need help in doing this correctly.

     Saving text on deletes in the named buffers is somewhat inefficient.

     The ssoouurrccee command does not work when executed as ::ssoouurrccee; there is no
     way to use the ::aappppeenndd, ::cchhaannggee, and ::iinnsseerrtt commands, since it is not
     possible to give more than one line of input to a :: escape.  To use these
     on a ::gglloobbaall you must QQ to ex command mode, execute them, and then reen-
     ter the screen editor with vvii or ooppeenn.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     The vvii command appeared in 3.0BSD.
