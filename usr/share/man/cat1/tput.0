     TTppuutt makes terminal-dependent information available to users or shell ap-
     plications.  The options are as follows:

     --TT      The terminal name as specified in the termcap database, for exam-
             ple, ``vt100'' or ``xterm''.  If not specified, ttppuutt retrieves
             the ``TERM'' variable from the environment.

     TTppuutt outputs a string if the _a_t_t_r_i_b_u_t_e is of type string; a number if it
     is of type integer.  Otherwise, ttppuutt exits 0 if the terminal has the ca-
     pability and 1 if it does not, without further action.

     The following special attributes are available:

     _c_l_e_a_r         Clear the screen (the termcap ``cl'' sequence).

     _i_n_i_t          Initialize the terminal (the termcap ``is'' sequence).

     _l_o_n_g_n_a_m_e      Print the descriptive name of the user's terminal type.

     _r_e_s_e_t         Reset the terminal (the termcap ``rs'' sequence).

     The exit value of ttppuutt is based on the last attribute specified.  If the
     attribute is of type string or of type integer, ttppuutt exits 0 if the at-
     tribute is defined for this terminal type and 1 if it is not.  If the at-
     tribute is of type boolean, ttppuutt exits 0 if the terminal has this at-
     tribute, and 1 if it does not.  TTppuutt exits 2 if any error occurred.

     TTppuutt can't really distinguish between different types of attributes.
     This is due to the limited interface in the current version of
     termcap(3),  and will be fixed in the near future.
