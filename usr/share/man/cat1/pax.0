DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     PPaaxx will read, write, and list the members of an archive file, and will
     copy directory hierarchies.  PPaaxx supports a wide variety of different
     archive formats.  These archive formats are described in more detail un-
     der the --xx option.

     The operand _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y specifies a destination directory pathname.  PPaaxx
     will exit with a non-zero exit status if the _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y operand does not
     exist, or it is not writable by the user, or it is not of type directory.

     The operand _p_a_t_t_e_r_n is used to select one or more pathnames of archive
     members using the pattern matching notation described by fnmatch(3).
     When no _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s are specified, all members of the archive will be se-
     lected.  When a _p_a_t_t_e_r_n matches a directory, the entire file hierarchy
     rooted at that directory will be selected.  If at the completion of oper-
     ation a _p_a_t_t_e_r_n operand did not select at least one archive member, ppaaxx
     will write these _p_a_t_t_e_r_n operands in a diagnostic message to standard
     error and then exit with a non-zero exit status.

     The operand _f_i_l_e specifies the pathname of a file to be copied or
     archived.  If at the completion of operation a _f_i_l_e operand did not se-
     lect at least one archived file, ppaaxx will write these _f_i_l_e operand path-
     names in a diagnostic message to standard error and then exit with a non-
     zero exit status.

     PPaaxx operates in one of four operational modes based on the presence of
     the --rr and the --ww options.  These operational modes are: _l_i_s_t, _r_e_a_d,
     _w_r_i_t_e, and _c_o_p_y_.

     <none>  _L_i_s_t. PPaaxx will write to standard output a table of contents of
             the members of the archive file read from standard input, whose
             pathnames match the specified _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s_. The table of contents is
             written with one filename per line and is not buffered more than
             a single line at a time.

     --rr      _R_e_a_d. PPaaxx extracts the members of the archive file read from the
             standard input, with pathnames matching the specified _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s_.
             The format and the blocking of the archive is automatically de-
             termined on input.  When an extracted file is a directory, the
             entire file hierarchy rooted at that directory is extracted.  All
             extracted files are created relative to the current file hierar-
             chy.  The ownership, access and modification times, and file mode
             of the extracted files are discussed in more detail under the --pp

             option.

     --ww      _W_r_i_t_e. PPaaxx writes an archive containing the _f_i_l_e operands to
             standard output using the specified archive format.  When no _f_i_l_e
             operands are specified, a list of files to copy, one per line, is
             read from standard input. A _f_i_l_e operand that is also a directory
             will include the entire file hierarchy rooted at that directory.

     --rr --ww   _C_o_p_y. PPaaxx copies the _f_i_l_e operands to the destination _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y.
             When no _f_i_l_e operands are specified, a list of files to copy, one
             per line, is read from the standard input. A _f_i_l_e operand that is
             also a directory will include the entire file hierarchy rooted at
             that directory.  The effect of the _c_o_p_y is as if the copied files
             were written to an archive file and then subsequently extracted,
             except that there may be hard links between the original and the
             copied files (see the --ll option below).

             _W_a_r_n_i_n_g: The destination _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y must not be one of the _f_i_l_e
             operands or a member of a file hierarchy rooted at one of the
             _f_i_l_e operands.  The result of a _c_o_p_y under these conditions is
             unpredictable.

     While processing a damaged archive during a _r_e_a_d or _l_i_s_t operation, ppaaxx
     will attempt to recover from media defects and will search through the
     archive to locate and process the largest number of archive members pos-
     sible (see the --EE option for more details on error handling).

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     The following options are supported:

     --rr    Read an archive file from standard input and extract the specified
           _f_i_l_e_s. If any intermediate directories are needed in order to ex-
           tract an archive member, these directories will be created as if
           mkdir(2) was called with the bitwise inclusive OR of S_IRWXU,
           S_IRWXG, and S_IRWXO as the mode argument.  When the selected
           archive format supports the specification of linked files and these
           files cannot be linked while the archive is being extracted, ppaaxx
           will write a diagnostic message to standard error and exit with a
           non-zero exit status at the completion of operation.

     --ww    Write files to the standard output in the specified archive format.
           When no _f_i_l_e operands are specified, standard input is read for a
           list of pathnames, one per line, without any leading or trailing
           <blanks>.

     --aa    Append _f_i_l_e_s to the end of an archive that was previously written.
           If an archive format is not specified with a --xx option, the format
           currently being used in the archive will be selected.  Any attempt
           to append to an archive in a format different from the format al-
           ready used in the archive will cause ppaaxx to exit immediately with a
           non-zero exit status.  The blocking size used in the archive volume
           where writing starts will continue to be used for the remainder of
           that archive volume.

           _W_a_r_n_i_n_g: Many storage devices are not able to support the opera-
           tions necessary to perform an append operation.  Any attempt to ap-
           pend to an archive stored on such a device may damage the archive
           or have other unpredictable results.  Tape drives in particular are
           more likely to not support an append operation.  An archive stored
           in a regular file system file or on a disk device will usually sup-
           port an append operation.

     --bb _b_l_o_c_k_s_i_z_e
           When _w_r_i_t_i_n_g an archive, block the output at a positive decimal in-
           teger number of bytes per write to the archive file.  The _b_l_o_c_k_s_i_z_e
           must be a multiple of 512 bytes with a maximum of 32256 bytes.  A
           _b_l_o_c_k_s_i_z_e can end with k or b to specify multiplication by 1024
           (1K) or 512, respectively.  A pair of _b_l_o_c_k_s_i_z_e_s can be separated
           by x to indicate a product.  A specific archive device may impose
           additional restrictions on the size of blocking it will support.
           When blocking is not specified, the default _b_l_o_c_k_s_i_z_e is dependent
           on the specific archive format being used (see the --xx option).

     --cc    Match all file or archive members _e_x_c_e_p_t those specified by the
           _p_a_t_t_e_r_n and _f_i_l_e operands.

     --dd    Cause files of type directory being copied or archived, or archive
           members of type directory being extracted, to match only the direc-
           tory file or archive member and not the file hierarchy rooted at
           the directory.

     --ff _a_r_c_h_i_v_e
           Specify _a_r_c_h_i_v_e as the pathname of the input or output archive,
           overriding the default standard input (for _l_i_s_t and _r_e_a_d) or
           standard output (for _w_r_i_t_e). A single archive may span multiple
           files and different archive devices.  When required, ppaaxx will
           prompt for the pathname of the file or device of the next volume in
           the archive.

     --ii    Interactively rename files or archive members.  For each archive
           member matching a _p_a_t_t_e_r_n operand or each file matching a _f_i_l_e
           operand, ppaaxx will prompt to _/_d_e_v_/_t_t_y giving the name of the file,
           its file mode and its modification time.  PPaaxx will then read a line
           from _/_d_e_v_/_t_t_y. If this line is blank, the file or archive member is
           skipped.  If this line consists of a single period, the file or
           archive member is processed with no modification to its name.  Oth-
           erwise, its name is replaced with the contents of the line.  PPaaxx
           will immediately exit with a non-zero exit status if <EOF> is en-
           countered when reading a response or if _/_d_e_v_/_t_t_y cannot be opened
           for reading and writing.

     --kk    Do not overwrite existing files.

     --ll    Link files. (The letter ell).  In the _c_o_p_y mode ( --rr --ww), hard
           links are made between the source and destination file hierarchies
           whenever possible.

     --nn    Select the first archive member that matches each _p_a_t_t_e_r_n operand.
           No more than one archive member is matched for each _p_a_t_t_e_r_n. When
           members of type directory are matched, the file hierarchy rooted at
           that directory is also matched (unless --dd is also specified).

     --oo _o_p_t_i_o_n_s
           Information to modify the algorithm for extracting or writing
           archive files which is specific to the archive format specified by
           --xx. In general, _o_p_t_i_o_n_s take the form: nnaammee==vvaalluuee

     --pp _s_t_r_i_n_g
           Specify one or more file characteristic options (privileges).  The
           _s_t_r_i_n_g option-argument is a string specifying file characteristics
           to be retained or discarded on extraction.  The string consists of
           the specification characters aa, ee, mm, oo, and pp. Multiple character-
           istics can be concatenated within the same string and multiple --pp
           options can be specified.  The meaning of the specification charac-
           ters are as follows:

           aa   Do not preserve file access times.  By default, file access
               times are preserved whenever possible.

           ee   `Preserve everything', the user ID, group ID, file mode bits,
               file access time, and file modification time.  This is intended
               to be used by _r_o_o_t, someone with all the appropriate privi-
               leges, in order to preserve all aspects of the files as they
               are recorded in the archive.  The ee flag is the sum of the oo
               and pp flags.

           mm   Do not preserve file modification times.  By default, file mod-
               ification times are preserved whenever possible.

           oo   Preserve the user ID and group ID.

           pp   `Preserve' the file mode bits.  This intended to be used by a
               _u_s_e_r with regular privileges who wants to preserve all aspects
               of the file other than the ownership.  The file times are pre-
               served by default, but two other flags are offered to disable
               this and use the time of extraction instead.

           In the preceding list, `preserve' indicates that an attribute
           stored in the archive is given to the extracted file, subject to
           the permissions of the invoking process.  Otherwise the attribute
           of the extracted file is determined as part of the normal file cre-
           ation action.  If neither the ee nor the oo specification character
           is specified, or the user ID and group ID are not preserved for any
           reason, ppaaxx will not set the S_ISUID (_s_e_t_u_i_d) and S_ISGID (_s_e_t_g_i_d)
           bits of the file mode.  If the preservation of any of these items
           fails for any reason, ppaaxx will write a diagnostic message to
           standard error. Failure to preserve these items will affect the fi-
           nal exit status, but will not cause the extracted file to be delet-
           ed.  If the file characteristic letters in any of the string op-
           tion-arguments are duplicated or conflict with each other, the
           one(s) given last will take precedence.  For example, if
                 --pp _e_m_e
           is specified, file modification times are still preserved.

     --ss _r_e_p_l_s_t_r
           Modify the file or archive member names specified by the _p_a_t_t_e_r_n or
           _f_i_l_e operands according to the substitution expression _r_e_p_l_s_t_r, us-
           ing the syntax of the ed(1) utility regular expressions.  The for-
           mat of these regular expressions are:
                 /old/new/[gp]
           As in ed(1),  oolldd is a basic regular expression and nneeww can contain
           an ampersand (&), \n (where n is a digit) back-references, or
           subexpression matching.  The oolldd string may also contain <newline>
           characters.  Any non-null character can be used as a delimiter (/
           is shown here).  Multiple --ss expressions can be specified.  The ex-
           pressions are applied in the order they are specified on the com-
           mand line, terminating with the first successful substitution.  The
           optional trailing gg continues to apply the substitution expression
           to the pathname substring which starts with the first character
           following the end of the last successful substitution. The first
           unsuccessful substitution stops the operation of the gg option.  The
           optional trailing pp will cause the final result of a successful
           substitution to be written to standard error in the following for-
           mat:
                 <original pathname> >> <new pathname>
           File or archive member names that substitute to the empty string
           are not selected and will be skipped.

     --tt    Reset the access times of any file or directory read or accessed by
           ppaaxx to be the same as they were before being read or accessed by
           ppaaxx.

     --uu    Ignore files that are older (having a less recent file modification
           time) than a pre-existing file or archive member with the same
           name.  During _r_e_a_d, an archive member with the same name as a file
           in the file system will be extracted if the archive member is newer
           than the file.  During _w_r_i_t_e, a file system member with the same
           name as an archive member will be written to the archive if it is
           newer than the archive member.  During _c_o_p_y, the file in the desti-
           nation hierarchy is replaced by the file in the source hierarchy or
           by a link to the file in the source hierarchy if the file in the
           source hierarchy is newer.

     --vv    During a _l_i_s_t operation, produce a verbose table of contents using
           the format of the ls(1) utility with the --ll option.  For pathnames
           representing a hard link to a previous member of the archive, the
           output has the format:
                 <ls -l listing> == <link name>
           For pathnames representing a symbolic link, the output has the for-
           mat:
                 <ls -l listing> => <link name>
           Where <ls -l listing> is the output format specified by the ls(1)
           utility when used with the --ll option.  Otherwise for all the other
           operational modes ( _r_e_a_d, _w_r_i_t_e, and _c_o_p_y), pathnames are written
           and flushed to standard error without a trailing <newline> as soon
           as processing begins on that file or archive member.  The trailing
           <newline>, is not buffered, and is written only after the file has
           been read or written.

     --xx _f_o_r_m_a_t
           Specify the output archive format, with the default format being
           _u_s_t_a_r. PPaaxx currently supports the following formats:

           _c_p_i_o     The extended cpio interchange format specified in the IEEE
                    Std1003.2 (``POSIX'') standard.  The default blocksize for
                    this format is 5120 bytes.  Inode and device information
                    about a file (used for detecting file hard links by this
                    format) which may be truncated by this format is detected
                    by ppaaxx and is repaired.

           _b_c_p_i_o    The old binary cpio format.  The default blocksize for
                    this format is 5120 bytes.  This format is not very
                    portable and should not be used when other formats are
                    available.  Inode and device information about a file
                    (used for detecting file hard links by this format) which
                    may be truncated by this format is detected by ppaaxx and is
                    repaired.

           _s_v_4_c_p_i_o  The System V release 4 cpio.  The default blocksize for
                    this format is 5120 bytes.  Inode and device information
                    about a file (used for detecting file hard links by this
                    format) which may be truncated by this format is detected
                    by ppaaxx and is repaired.

           _s_v_4_c_r_c   The System V release 4 cpio with file crc checksums.  The
                    default blocksize for this format is 5120 bytes.  Inode
                    and device information about a file (used for detecting
                    file hard links by this format) which may be truncated by
                    this format is detected by ppaaxx and is repaired.

           _t_a_r      The old BSD tar format as found in BSD4.3.  The default
                    blocksize for this format is 10240 bytes.  Pathnames
                    stored by this format must be 100 characters or less in
                    length.  Only _r_e_g_u_l_a_r files, _h_a_r_d _l_i_n_k_s, _s_o_f_t _l_i_n_k_s, and
                    _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_i_e_s will be archived (other file system types are
                    not supported).  For backwards compatability with even
                    older tar formats, a --oo option can be used when writing an
                    archive to omit the storage of directories.  This option
                    takes the form:
                          --oo wwrriittee__oopptt==nnooddiirr

           _u_s_t_a_r    The extended tar interchange format specified in the IEEE
                    Std1003.2 (``POSIX'') standard.  The default blocksize for
                    this format is 10240 bytes.  Pathnames stored by this for-
                    mat must be 250 characters or less in length.

           PPaaxx will detect and report any file that it is unable to store or
           extract as the result of any specific archive format restrictions.
           The individual archive formats may impose additional restrictions
           on use.  Typical archive format restrictions include (but are not
           limited to): file pathname length, file size, link pathname length
           and the type of the file.

     --BB _b_y_t_e_s
           Limit the number of bytes written to a single archive volume to
           _b_y_t_e_s. The _b_y_t_e_s limit can end with m, k, or b to specify multipli-
           cation by 1048576 (1M), 1024 (1K) or 512, respectively.  A pair of
           _b_y_t_e_s limits can be separated by x to indicate a product.

           _W_a_r_n_i_n_g: Only use this option when writing a archive to a device
           which supports an end of file read condition based on last (or
           largest) write offset (such as a regular file or a tape drive).
           The use of this option with a floppy or hard disk is not recommend-
           ed.

     --DD    This option is the same as the --uu option, except that the file in-
           ode change time is checked instead of the file modification time.
           The file inode change time can be used to select files whose inode
           information (e.g. uid, gid, etc.) is newer than a copy of the file
           in the destination _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y.

     --EE _l_i_m_i_t
           Limit the number of consecutive read faults while trying to read a
           flawed archives to _l_i_m_i_t. With a positive _l_i_m_i_t, ppaaxx will attempt
           to recover from an archive read error and will continue processing
           starting with the next file stored in the archive.  A _l_i_m_i_t of 0
           will cause ppaaxx to stop operation after the first read error is de-
           tected on an archive volume.  A _l_i_m_i_t of NONE will cause ppaaxx to at-
           tempt to recover from read errors forever.  The default _l_i_m_i_t is a
           small positive number of retries.

           _W_a_r_n_i_n_g_: Using this option with NONE should be used with extreme
           caution as ppaaxx may get stuck in an infinite loop on a very badly
           flawed archive.

     --GG _g_r_o_u_p
           Select a file based on its _g_r_o_u_p name, or when starting with a ##, a
           numeric gid.  A '\' can be used to escape the ##. Multiple --GG op-
           tions may be supplied and checking stops with the first match.

     --HH    Follow only command line symbolic links while performing a physical
           file system traversal.

     --LL    Follow all symbolic links to perform a logical file system traver-
           sal.

     --TT _[_f_r_o_m___d_a_t_e_]_[_,_t_o___d_a_t_e_]_[_/_[_c_]_[_m_]_]
           Allow files to be selected based on a file modification or inode
           change time falling within a specified time range of _f_r_o_m___d_a_t_e to
           _t_o___d_a_t_e (the dates are inclusive).  If only a _f_r_o_m___d_a_t_e is sup-
           plied, all files with a modification or inode change time equal to
           or younger are selected.  If only a _t_o___d_a_t_e is supplied, all files
           with a modification or inode change time equal to or older will be
           selected.  When the _f_r_o_m___d_a_t_e is equal to the _t_o___d_a_t_e, only files
           with a modification or inode change time of exactly that time will
           be selected.

           When ppaaxx is in the _w_r_i_t_e or _c_o_p_y mode, the optional trailing field
           _[_c_]_[_m_] can be used to determine which file time (inode change, file
           modification or both) are used in the comparison.  If neither is
           specified, the default is to use file modification time only.  The
           _m specifies the comparison of file modification time (the time when
           the file was last written).  The _c specifies the comparison of in-
           ode change time (the time when the file inode was last changed;
           e.g. a change of owner, group, mode, etc).  When _c and _m are both
           specified, then the modification and inode change times are both
           compared.  The inode change time comparison is useful in selecting
           files whose attributes were recently changed or selecting files
           which were recently created and had their modification time reset
           to an older time (as what happens when a file is extracted from an
           archive and the modification time is preserved).  Time comparisons
           using both file times is useful when ppaaxx is used to create a time
           based incremental archive (only files that were changed during a
           specified time range will be archived).

           A time range is made up of six different fields and each field must
           contain two digits.  The format is:
                 [yy[mm[dd[hh]]]]mm[.ss]
           Where yyyy is the last two digits of the year, the first mmmm is the
           month (from 01 to 12), dddd is the day of the month (from 01 to 31),
           hhhh is the hour of the day (from 00 to 23), the second mmmm is the
           minute (from 00 to 59), and ssss is the seconds (from 00 to 59).  The
           minute field mmmm is required, while the other fields are optional
           and must be added in the following order:
                 hhhh, dddd, mmmm, yyyy.
           The ssss field may be added independently of the other fields.  Time
           ranges are relative to the current time, so
                 --TT _1_2_3_4_/_c_m
           would select all files with a modification or inode change time of
           12:34 PM today or later.  Multiple --TT time range can be supplied
           and checking stops with the first match.

     --UU _u_s_e_r
           Select a file based on its _u_s_e_r name, or when starting with a ##, a
           numeric uid.  A '\' can be used to escape the ##. Multiple --UU op-
           tions may be supplied and checking stops with the first match.

     --XX    When traversing the file hierarchy specified by a pathname, do not
           descend into directories that have a different device ID.  See the
           st_dev field as described in stat(2) for more information about de-
           vice ID's.

     --YY    This option is the same as the --DD option, except that the inode
           change time is checked using the pathname created after all the
           file name modifications have completed.

     --ZZ    This option is the same as the --uu option, except that the modifica-
           tion time is checked using the pathname created after all the file
           name modifications have completed.

     The options that operate on the names of files or archive members ( --cc,
     --ii, --nn, --ss, --uu, --vv, --DD, --GG, --TT, --UU, --YY, and --ZZ) interact as follows.

     When extracting files during a _r_e_a_d operation, archive members are
     `selected', based only on the user specified pattern operands as modified
     by the --cc, --nn, --uu, --DD, --GG, --TT, --UU options.  Then any --ss and --ii options
     will modify in that order, the names of these selected files.  Then the
     --YY and --ZZ options will be applied based on the final pathname.  Finally
     the --vv option will write the names resulting from these modifications.

     When archiving files during a _w_r_i_t_e operation, or copying files during a
     _c_o_p_y operation, archive members are `selected', based only on the user
     specified pathnames as modified by the --nn, --uu, --DD, --GG, --TT, and --UU options
     (the --DD option only applies during a copy operation).  Then any --ss and --ii
     options will modify in that order, the names of these selected files.
     Then during a _c_o_p_y operation the --YY and the --ZZ options will be applied
     based on the final pathname.  Finally the --vv option will write the names
     resulting from these modifications.

     When one or both of the --uu or --DD options are specified along with the --nn
     option, a file is not considered selected unless it is newer than the
     file to which it is compared.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
     The command:
           pax -w -f /dev/rst0 .
     copies the contents of the current directory to the device _/_d_e_v_/_r_s_t_0.

     The command:
           pax -r -v -f filename
     gives the verbose table of contents for an archive stored in _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.

     The following commands:
           mkdir newdir
           cd olddir
           pax -rw . newdir
     will copy the entire _o_l_d_d_i_r directory hierarchy to _n_e_w_d_i_r.

     The command:
           pax -r -s ',^//*usr//*,,' -f a.pax
     reads the archive _a_._p_a_x, with all files rooted in ``/usr'' into the
     archive extracted relative to the current directory.

     The command:
           pax -rw -i . dest_dir
     can be used to interactively select the files to copy from the current
     directory to _d_e_s_t___d_i_r.

     The command:
           pax -r -pe -U root -G bin -f a.pax
     will extract all files from the archive _a_._p_a_x which are owned by _r_o_o_t
     with group _b_i_n and will preserve all file permissions.

     The command:
           pax -r -w -v -Y -Z home /backup
     will update (and list) only those files in the destination directory
     _/_b_a_c_k_u_p which are older (less recent inode change or file modification
     times) than files with the same name found in the source file tree _h_o_m_e.

SSTTAANNDDAARRDDSS
     The ppaaxx utility is a superset of the IEEE Std1003.2 (``POSIX'') standard.
     The options --BB, --DD, --EE, --GG, --HH, --TT, --UU, --YY, --ZZ, the archive formats
     _b_c_p_i_o, _s_v_4_c_p_i_o, _s_v_4_c_r_c, _t_a_r, and the flawed archive handling during _l_i_s_t
     and _r_e_a_d operations are extensions to the POSIX standard.

     ppaaxx will exit with one of the following values:

     0   All files were processed successfully.

     1   An error occurred.

     Whenever ppaaxx cannot create a file or a link when reading an archive or
     cannot find a file when writing an archive, or cannot preserve the user
     ID, group ID, or file mode when the --pp option is specified, a diagnostic
     message is written to standard error and a non-zero exit status will be
     returned, but processing will continue.  In the case where pax cannot
     create a link to a file, ppaaxx will not create a second copy of the file.


     If the extraction of a file from an archive is prematurely terminated by
     a signal or error, ppaaxx may have only partially extracted a file the user
     wanted.  Additionally, the file modes of extracted files and directories
     may have incorrect file bits, and the modification and access times may
     be wrong.

     If the creation of an archive is prematurely terminated by a signal or
     error, ppaaxx may have only partially created the archive which may violate
     the specific archive format specification.

     If while doing a _c_o_p_y, ppaaxx detects a file is about to overwrite itself,
     the file is not copied, a diagnostic message is written to standard error
     and when ppaaxx completes it will exit with a non-zero exit status.
