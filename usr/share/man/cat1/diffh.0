     The ddiiffff utility compares the contents of _f_i_l_e_1 and _f_i_l_e_2 and writes to
     the standard output the list of changes necessary to convert one file
     into the other.  No output is produced if the files are identical.

     Output options (mutually exclusive):

     --cc        produces a diff with lines of context.  The default is to
	       present 3 lines of context and may be changed, e.g to 10, by
	       --cc1100.  With --cc the output format is modified slightly: the out-
	       put beginning with identification of the files involved and
	       their creation dates and then each change is separated by a
	       line with a dozen *'s.  The lines removed from _f_i_l_e_1 are marked
	       with `- '; those added to _f_i_l_e_2 are marked `+ '.  Lines which
	       are changed from one file to the other are marked in both files
	       with with `! '.	Changes which lie within <context> lines of
	       each other are grouped together on output.  (This is a change
	       from the previous ``diff -c'' but the resulting output is usu-
	       ally much easier to interpret.)

     --ee        produces output in a form suitable as input for the editor
	       utility, ed(1), which can then be used to convert file1 into
	       file2.

	       Extra commands are added to the output when comparing direc-
	       tories with --ee, so that the result is a sh(1) script for con-
	       verting text files which are common to the two directories from
	       their state in _d_i_r_1 to their state in _d_i_r_2.

     --ff        identical output of the --ee flag, but in reverse order.  It can-
	       not be digested by ed(1).

     --hh        Invokes an alternate algorithm which can handle files of very
	       long lengths.  There is a trade off. The algorithm can only
	       deal with changes which are clearly delimited and brief. Long
	       sections of changes and overlaps will confuse it.

     --nn        produces a script similar to that of --ee, but in the opposite
	       order and with a count of changed lines on each insert or
	       delete command.	This is the form used by rcsdiff(1).

     --DD_s_t_r_i_n_g
	       creates a merged version of _f_i_l_e_1 and _f_i_l_e_2 on the standard
	       output, with C preprocessor controls included so that a compi-
	       lation of the result without defining _s_t_r_i_n_g is equivalent to
	       compiling _f_i_l_e_1, while defining _s_t_r_i_n_g will yield _f_i_l_e_2.

     Comparison options:

     --bb        causes trailing blanks (spaces and tabs) to be ignored, and
	       other strings of blanks to compare equal.

     --ii        ignores the case of letters.  E.g., ``A'' will compare equal to
	       ``a''.

     --tt        will expand tabs in output lines.  Normal or --cc output adds
	       character(s) to the front of each line which may screw up the
	       indentation of the original source lines and make the output
	       listing difficult to interpret.	This option will preserve the
	       original source's indentation.

     --ww        is similar to --bb but causes whitespace (blanks and tabs) to be
	       totally ignored.  E.g., ``if ( a == b )'' will compare equal to
	       ``if(a==b)''.

     Directory comparison options:

     --ll        long output format; each text file ddiiffff'd is piped through
	       pr(1) to paginate it, other differences are remembered and
	       summarized after all text file differences are reported.

     --rr        causes application of ddiiffff recursively to common subdirectories
	       encountered.

     --ss        causes ddiiffff to report files which are the same, which are oth-
	       erwise not mentioned.

     --SS_n_a_m_e    re-starts a directory ddiiffff in the middle beginning with file
	       _n_a_m_e.

     If both arguments are directories, ddiiffff sorts the contents of the direc-
     tories by name, and then runs the regular file ddiiffff algorithm, producing
     a change list, on text files which are different.	Binary files which
     differ, common subdirectories, and files which appear in only one direc-
     tory are described as such.

     If only one of _f_i_l_e_1 and _f_i_l_e_2 is a directory, ddiiffff is applied to the
     non-directory file and the file contained in the directory file with a
     filename that is the same as the last component of the non-directory
     file.

     If either the _f_i_l_e_1 or _f_i_l_e_2 is the standard input is used in its place.

  OOuuttppuutt SSttyyllee
     The default (without --ee, --cc, or --nn options) output contains lines of
     these forms, where _X_X, _Y_Y, _Z_Z, _Q_Q are line numbers respective of file
     order.

	   XXaaYY	       At (the end of) line _X_X of _f_i_l_e_1, append the
			       contents of line _Y_Y of _f_i_l_e_2 to make them
			       equal.
	   XXaaYY,ZZ	       Same as above, but append the range of lines,
			       _Y_Y through _Z_Z of _f_i_l_e_2 to line _X_X of file1.
	   XXddYY	       At line _X_X delete the line. The value _Y_Y tells
			       to which line the change would bring _f_i_l_e_1 in
			       line with _f_i_l_e_1.
	   XX,YYddZZ	       Delete the range of lines _X_X through _Y_Y in
			       _f_i_l_e_1.
	   XXccYY	       Change the line _X_X in _f_i_l_e_1 to the line _Y_Y in
			       _f_i_l_e_2.
	   XX,YYccZZ	       Replace the range of specified lines with the
			       line _Z_Z.
	   XX,YYccZZ,QQ	       Replace the range _X_X,_Y_Y from _f_i_l_e_1 with the
			       range _Z_Z,_Q_Q from _f_i_l_e_2.


     These lines resemble ed(1) subcommands to convert _f_i_l_e_1 into _f_i_l_e_2.  The
     line numbers before the action letters pertain to _f_i_l_e_1; those after per-
     tain to _f_i_l_e_2.  Thus, by exchanging aa for dd and reading the line in re-
     verse order, one can also determine how to convert _f_i_l_e_2 into _f_i_l_e_1.  As
     in ed(1), identical pairs (where num1 = num2) are abbreviated as a single
     number.

     TMPDIR    If the environment variable TMPDIR exists, DDiiffff will use the
	       name specified by TMPDIR as an alternate temporary directory.

     DDiiffff appeared in Version 6 AT&T Unix.

     The ddiiffff utility exits with one of the following values:

	   0	 No differences were found.
	   1	 Differences were found.
	   >1	 An error occurred.


BBUUGGSS
     The --ff and --ee options do not provide special handling for lines on which
     the first and only character is ``.''.  This can cause problems for
     ed(1).

     When comparing directories with the --bb, --ww or --ii options specified, ddiiffff
     first compares the files ala _c_m_p, and then decides to run the ddiiffff algo-
     rithm if they are not equal.  This may cause a small amount of spurious
     output if the files then turn out to be identical because the only
     differences are insignificant white space or case differences.
