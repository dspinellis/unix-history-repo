     The llooggiinn utility logs users (and pseudo-users) into the computer system.

     If no user is specified, or if a user is specified and authentication of
     the user fails, llooggiinn prompts for a user name.  Authentication of users
     is done via passwords.

     The options are as follows:

     --ff      The --ff option is used when a user name is specified to indicate
             that proper authentication has already been done and that no
             password need be requested.  This option may only be used by the
             super-user or when an already logged in user is logging in as
             themselves.

     --hh      The --hh option specifies the host from which the connection was
             received.  It is used by various daemons such as telnetd(8).
             This option may only be used by the super-user.

     --pp      By default, llooggiinn discards any previous environment.  The --pp op-
             tion disables this behavior.

     If the file _/_e_t_c_/_n_o_l_o_g_i_n exists, llooggiinn dislays its contents to the user
     and exits.  This is used by shutdown(8) to prevent users from logging in
     when the system is about to go down.

     Immediately after logging a user in, llooggiinn displays the system copyright
     notice, the date and time the user last logged in, the message of the day
     as well as other information.  If the file ``_._h_u_s_h_l_o_g_i_n'' exists in the
     user's home directory, all of these messages are suppressed.  This is to
     simplify logins for non-human users, such as uucp(1).  LLooggiinn then records
     an entry in the wtmp(5) and utmp(5) files and executes the user's command
     interpretor.

     Login enters information into the environment (see environ(7))  specify-
     ing the user's home directory (HOME), command interpreter (SHELL), search
     path (PATH), terminal type (TERM) and user name (both LOGNAME and USER).

     The standard shells, csh(1) and sh(1),  do not fork before executing the
     llooggiinn utility.
