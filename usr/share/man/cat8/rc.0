     RRcc is the command script which controls the automatic reboot and rrcc..llooccaall
     is the script holding commands which are pertinent only to a specific
     site.

     When an automatic reboot is in progress, rrcc is invoked with the argument
     _a_u_t_o_b_o_o_t. The first portion of rrcc runs an fsck(8) with option --pp to
     ``preen'' all the disks of minor inconsistencies resulting from the last
     system shutdown and to check for serious inconsistencies caused by hard-
     ware or software failure.  If this auto-check and repair succeeds, then
     the second part of rrcc is run.

     The second part of rrcc, which is run after a auto-reboot succeeds and also
     if rrcc is invoked when a single user shell terminates (see init(8)),
     starts all the daemons on the system, preserves editor files and clears
     the scratch directory _/_t_m_p.

     RRcc..llooccaall is executed immediately before any other commands after a suc-
     cessful fsck.  Normally, the first commands placed in the rrcc..llooccaall file
     define the machine's name, using hostname(1),  and save any possible core
     image that might have been generated as a result of a system crash, with
     savecore(8).  The latter command is included in the rrcc..llooccaall file because
     the directory in which core dumps are saved is usually site specific.

     Following tradition, the startup files rrcc and rrcc..llooccaall reside in _/_e_t_c.
