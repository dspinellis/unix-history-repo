     mmaakkeemmaapp creates the database maps used by the keyed map lookups in
     sendmail(8).  It reads input from the standard input and outputs them to
     the indicated _m_a_p_n_a_m_e.

     Depending on how it is compiled, mmaakkeemmaapp handles up to three different
     database formats, selected using the _m_a_p_t_y_p_e parameter.  They may be

     dbm         DBM format maps.  This requires the ndbm(3) library.

     btree       B-Tree format maps.  This requires the new Berkeley db(3) li-
                 brary.

     hash        Hash format maps.  This also requires the db(3) library.

     In all cases, mmaakkeemmaapp reads lines from the standard input consisting of
     two words separated by white space.  The first is the database key, the
     second is the value.  The value may contain ``%_n'' strings to indicated
     parameter substitution.  Literal parentheses should be doubled (``%%'').
     Blank lines and lines beginning with ``#'' are ignored.

     --NN          Include the null byte that terminates strings in the map.
                 This must match the -N flag in the sendmail.cf ``K'' line.

     --ff          Fold all upper case letters in the key to lower case; this is
                 intended to mesh with the -f flag in the KK line in send-
                 mail.cf.  The value is not case folded.

     --oo          Append to an old file.  This allows you to augment an exist-
                 ing file.

     --rr          Allow replacement of existing keys.  Normally mmaakkeemmaapp com-
                 plains if you repeat a key, and does not do the insert.

     --vv          Verbosely print what it is doing.
