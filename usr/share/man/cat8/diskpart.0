     DDiisskkppaarrtt is used to calculate the disk partition sizes based on the de-
     fault rules used at Berkeley.

     Available options and operands:

     --pp          Tables suitable for inclusion in a device driver are pro-
                 duced.

     --dd          An entry suitable for inclusion in the disk description file
                 _/_e_t_c_/_d_i_s_k_t_a_b is generated; for example, disktab(5).

     --ss _s_i_z_e     The size of the disk may be limited to _s_i_z_e with the --ss op-
                 tion.

     On disks that use bad144(8) type of bad-sector forwarding, space is nor-
     mally left in the last partition on the disk for a bad sector forwarding
     table, although this space is not reflected in the tables produced.  The
     space reserved is one track for the replicated copies of the table and
     sufficient tracks to hold a pool of 126 sectors to which bad sectors are
     mapped.  For more information, see bad144(8).  The --ss option is intended
     for other controllers which reserve some space at the end of the disk for
     bad-sector replacements or other control areas, even if not a multiple of
     cylinders.

     The disk partition sizes are based on the total amount of space on the
     disk as given in the table below (all values are supplied in units of
     sectors).  The `c' partition is, by convention, used to access the entire
     physical disk.  The device driver tables include the space reserved for
     the bad sector forwarding table in the `c' partition; those used in the
     disktab and default formats exclude reserved tracks.  In normal opera-
     tion, either the `g' partition is used, or the `d', `e', and `f' parti-
     tions are used.  The `g' and `f' partitions are variable-sized, occupying
     whatever space remains after allocation of the fixed sized partitions.
     If the disk is smaller than 20 Megabytes, then ddiisskkppaarrtt aborts with the
     message ``disk too small, calculate by hand''.

     Partition   20-60 MB   61-205 MB   206-355 MB   356+ MB
     a           15884      15884       15884        15884
     b           10032      33440       33440        66880
     d           15884      15884       15884        15884
     e           unused     55936       55936        307200
     h           unused     unused      291346       291346

     If an unknown disk type is specified, ddiisskkppaarrtt will prompt for the re-
     quired disk geometry information.

BBUUGGSS
     Most default partition sizes are based on historical artifacts (like the
     RP06), and may result in unsatisfactory layouts.

     When using the --dd flag, alternate disk names are not included in the out-
     put.

     The ddiisskkppaarrtt command appeared in 4.2BSD.
