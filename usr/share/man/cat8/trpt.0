     TTrrpptt interrogates the buffer of TCP trace records created when a socket
     is marked for ``debugging'' (see setsockopt(2)),  and prints a readable
     description of these records.  When no options are supplied, ttrrpptt prints
     all the trace records found in the system grouped according to TCP con-
     nection protocol control block (PCB). The following options may be used
     to alter this behavior.

     --aa      In addition to the normal output, print the values of the source
             and destination addresses for each packet recorded.

     --ff      Follow the trace as it occurs, waiting a short time for addition-
             al records each time the end of the log is reached.

     --jj      Just give a list of the protocol control block addresses for
             which there are trace records.

     --pp      Show only trace records associated with the protocol control
             block at the given address _h_e_x_-_a_d_d_r_e_s_s.

     --ss      In addition to the normal output, print a detailed description of
             the packet sequencing information.

     --tt      in addition to the normal output, print the values for all timers
             at each point in the trace.

     The recommended use of ttrrpptt is as follows.  Isolate the problem and en-
     able debugging on the socket(s) involved in the connection.  Find the ad-
     dress of the protocol control blocks associated with the sockets using
     the --AA option to netstat(1).  Then run ttrrpptt with the --pp option, supplying
     the associated protocol control block addresses.  The --ff option can be
     used to follow the trace log once the trace is located.  If there are
     many sockets using the debugging option, the --jj option may be useful in
     checking to see if any trace records are present for the socket in ques-
     tion.  The

     If debugging is being performed on a system or core file other than the
     default, the last two arguments may be used to supplant the defaults.
