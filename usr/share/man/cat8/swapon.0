     SSwwaappoonn is used to specify additional devices on which paging and swapping
     are to take place.  The system begins by swapping and paging on only a
     single device so that only one disk is required at bootstrap time.  Calls
     to sswwaappoonn normally occur in the system multi-user initialization file
     _/_e_t_c_/_r_c making all swap devices available, so that the paging and swap-
     ping activity is interleaved across several devices.

     Normally, the first form is used:

     --aa      All devices marked as ``sw'' swap devices in _/_e_t_c_/_f_s_t_a_b are made
             available.

     The second form gives individual block devices as given in the system
     swap configuration table.  The call makes only this space available to
     the system for swap allocation.

BBUUGGSS
     There is no way to stop paging and swapping on a device.  It is therefore
     not possible to make use of devices which may be dismounted during system
     operation.
