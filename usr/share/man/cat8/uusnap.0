     _U_u_s_n_a_p displays in tabular format a synopsis of the current
     UUCP situation.  The format of each line is as follows:

	       site   N Cmds   N Data	N Xqts	 Message

     Where "site" is the name of the site with work, "N" is a
     count of each of the three possible types of work (command,
     data, or remote execute), and "Message" is the current
     status message for that site as found in the STST file.

     Included in "Message" may be the time left before UUCP can
     re-try the call, and the count of the number of times that
     UUCP has tried (unsuccessfully) to reach the site.
