       _N_a_m_e_d is the Internet domain name server.  See RFC's 1033,
       1034,  and 1035 for more information on the Internet name-
       domain system.  Without any arguments, _n_a_m_e_d will read the
       default  boot  file _/_e_t_c_/_n_a_m_e_d_._b_o_o_t, read any initial data
       and listen for queries.

       Options are:

       --dd     Print debugging information.  A  number  after  the
              ``d'' determines the level of messages printed.

       --pp     Use  a  different  port number.  The default is the
              standard port  number  as  returned  by  getservby­
              name(3) for service ``domain''.

       --bb     Use  an  alternate boot file.  This is optional and
              allows you to specify a file with a leading dash.

       --qq     Trace all incoming queries if _n_a_m_e_d has  been  com­
              piled with _Q_R_Y_L_O_G defined.

       Any  additional  argument is taken as the name of the boot
       file.  If multiple boot files are specified, only the last
       is used.

       The  boot  file  contains information about where the name
       server is to get its initial data.  Lines in the boot file
       cannot be continued on subsequent lines.  The following is
       a small example:

         ;
         ;    boot file for name server
         ;
         directory /usr/local/adm/named

         ; type     domain                source host/file          backup file

         ; slave

       The ``directory'' line causes the  server  to  change  its
       working directory to the directory specified.  This can be
       important for the correct processing of $INCLUDE files  in
       primary zone files.

       The  ``cache''  line specifies that data in ``root.cache''
       is to be placed in the backup cache.  Its main use  is  to
       specify  data  such  as  locations of root domain servers.
       This cache is not used during  normal  operation,  but  is
       used  as  ``hints'' to find the current root servers.  The
       file ``root.cache'' is in  the  same  format  as  ``berke­
       ley.edu.zone''.  There can be more than one ``cache'' file
       specified.  The ``root.cache'' file  should  be  retrieved
       periodically  from FTP.RS.INTERNIC.NET since it contains a
       list of root servers, and this list changes  periodically.

       The  first  example  ``primary'' line states that the file
       ``berkeley.edu.zone'' contains authoritative data for  the
       ``Berkeley.EDU''  zone.   The  file  ``berkeley.edu.zone''
       contains data in  the  master  file  format  described  in
       RFC883.   All  domain names are relative to the origin, in
       this case, ``Berkeley.EDU'' (see below for a more detailed
       description).  The second ``primary'' line states that the
       file ``ucbhosts.rev'' contains authoritative data for  the
       domain ``32.128.IN-ADDR.ARPA,'' which is used to translate
       addresses in network 128.32  to  hostnames.   Each  master
       file  should  begin  with  an SOA record for the zone (see
       below).

       The first example ``secondary'' line  specifies  that  all
       authoritative  data  under  ``CC.Berkeley.EDU''  is  to be
       transferred from the name server at 128.32.137.8.  If  the
       transfer  fails it will try 128.32.137.3 and continue try­
       ing the addresses, up to 10, listed  on  this  line.   The
       secondary  copy  is  also  authoritative for the specified
       domain.  The first non-dotted-quad address  on  this  line
       will  be taken as a filename in which to backup the trans­
       fered zone.  The name server will load the zone from  this
       backup  file  if it exists when it boots, providing a com­
       plete copy even if the  master  servers  are  unreachable.
       Whenever a new copy of the domain is received by automatic
       zone transfer from one of the master  servers,  this  file
       will  be  updated.   If no file name is given, a temporary
       file will be used, and will be deleted after each success­
       ful  zone transfer.  This is not recommended since it is a
       needless waste of bandwidth.  The  second  example  ``sec­
       ondary''  line states that the address-to-hostname mapping
       for the subnet 128.32.136 should be obtained from the same

       list of master servers as the previous zone.

       The   ``forwarders''   line  specifies  the  addresses  of
       sitewide servers that will accept recursive  queries  from
       other  servers.   If  the  boot file specifies one or more
       forwarders, then the server will send all queries for data
       not  in the cache to the forwarders first.  Each forwarder
       will be asked in turn until an answer is returned  or  the
       list  is  exhausted.   If  no answer is forthcoming from a
       forwarder, the server will continue as it would have with­
       out  the  forwarders  line unless it is in ``slave'' mode.
       The  forwarding  facility  is  useful  to  cause  a  large
       sitewide  cache to be generated on a master, and to reduce
       traffic over links to outside servers.   It  can  also  be
       used  to  allow  servers  to  run  that do not have access
       directly to the Internet, but wish to act as  though  they
       do.

       The  ``slave''  line  (shown commented out) is used to put
       the server in slave mode.  In this mode, the  server  will
       only  make queries to forwarders.  This option is normally
       used on machine that wish to run a server but for physical
       or  administrative  reasons  cannot be given access to the
       Internet, but have access to a host that does have access.

       The  ``sortlist''  line  can  be used to indicate networks
       that are to be preferred over other networks  Queries  for
       host  addresses  from  hosts  on  the  same network as the
       server will receive responses with local network addresses
       listed  first, then addresses on the sort list, then other
       addresses.

       The ``xfrnets'' directive  (not  shown)  can  be  used  to
       implement  primative access control.  If this directive is
       given, then your name server will only answer zone  trans­
       fer  requests  from  hosts which are on networks listed in
       your ``xfrnets'' directives.  This directive may  also  be
       given  as ``tcplist'' for compatibility with older, inter­
       rim servers.

       The ``include'' directive (not shown) can be used to  pro­
       cess  the  contents  of  some  other  file  as though they
       appeared in place of the ``include'' directive.   This  is
       useful  if  you have a lot of zones or if you have logical
       groupings of zones which are maintained by different  peo­
       ple.   The  ``include'' directive takes one argument, that
       being the name of  the  file  whose  contents  are  to  be
       included.   No quotes are neccessary around the file name.

       The ``bogusns'' directive (not shown) tells BIND  that  no
       queries  are  to  be  sent  to  the  specified name server

       addresses (which are specified as  dotted  quads,  not  as
       domain  names).   This  is  useful when you know that some
       popular server has bad data in a zone or  cache,  and  you
       want  to  avoid  contamination  while the problem is being
       fixed.

       The master file consists of control information and a list
       of resource records for objects in the zone of the forms:

              $INCLUDE <filename> <opt_domain>
              $ORIGIN <domain>
              <domain> <opt_ttl> <opt_class> <type> <resource_record_data>

       where  _d_o_m_a_i_n is "." for root, "@" for the current origin,
       or a standard domain name. If _d_o_m_a_i_n is a standard  domain
       name  that  does not end with ``.'', the current origin is
       appended to the domain. Domain names ending with ``.'' are
       unmodified.   The  _o_p_t___d_o_m_a_i_n  field  is used to define an
       origin for the data in an included file.  It is equivalent
       to  placing  a  $ORIGIN statement before the first line of
       the included file.  The field is  optional.   Neither  the
       _o_p_t___d_o_m_a_i_n  field  nor  $ORIGIN statements in the included
       file modify the current origin for this file.  The _o_p_t___t_t_l
       field  is  an optional integer number for the time-to-live
       field.  It defaults to zero,  meaning  the  minimum  value
       specified  in  the SOA record for the zone.  The _o_p_t___c_l_a_s_s
       field is the object address type; currently only one  type
       is  supported,  IINN,  for  objects  connected  to the DARPA
       Internet.  The _t_y_p_e field contains one  of  the  following
       tokens;  the  data  expected  in  the _r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e___r_e_c_o_r_d___d_a_t_a
       field is in parentheses.

       A        a host address (dotted quad)

       NS       an authoritative name server (domain)

       MX       a mail exchanger (domain), preceded by a  prefer­
                ence  value (0..32767), with lower numeric values
                representing higher logical preferences.

       CNAME    the canonical name for an alias (domain)

       SOA      marks the start of a zone of authority (domain of
                originating host, domain address of maintainer, a
                serial number and  the  following  parameters  in
                seconds:  refresh,  retry, expire and minimum TTL
                (see RFC883)).

       NULL     a null resource record (no format or data)

       RP       a  Responsible  Person  for  some   domain   name

                (mailbox, TXT-referral)

       PTR      a domain name pointer (domain)

       HINFO    host information (cpu_type OS_type)

       Resource  records  normally  end at the end of a line, but
       may be continued across lines between opening and  closing
       parentheses.   Comments  are  introduced by semicolons and
       continue to the end of the line.

       Note that there are other resource record types, not shown
       here.   You  should  consult  the  BIND  Operations  Guide
       (``BOG'') for the complete  list.   Some  resource  record
       types  may  have  been standardized in newer RFC's but not
       yet implemented in this version of BIND.

       Each master zone file should begin with an SOA record  for
       the zone.  An example SOA record is as follows:

       @    IN   SOA  ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU. rwh.ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU. (
                           1989020501     ; serial
                           10800     ; refresh
                           3600 ; retry
                           3600000   ; expire
                           86400 )   ; minimum

       The SOA specifies a serial number, which should be changed
       each time the master  file  is  changed.   Note  that  the
       serial number can be given as a dotted number, but this is
       a _v_e_r_y unwise thing to do since the translation to  normal
       integers  is  via concatenation rather than multiplication
       and addition.  You can spell out the year, month,  day  of
       month,  and  0..99 version number and still fit inside the
       unsigned 32-bit size of this field.   It's  true  that  we
       will  have  to  rethink  this  strategy  in  the year 4294
       (Greg.) but we're not worried about it.  Secondary servers
       check  the  serial  number  at  intervals specified by the
       refresh time in seconds; if the serial number  changes,  a
       zone  transfer  will  be  done to load the new data.  If a
       master server cannot be contacted when a refresh  is  due,
       the  retry  time specifies the interval at which refreshes
       should be attempted.  If a master server  cannot  be  con­
       tacted  within  the interval given by the expire time, all
       data from the zone is discarded by secondary servers.  The
       minimum  value  is  the  time-to-live  (``TTL'')  used  by
       records in the file with no explicit time-to-live value.

       implementation of suffixing for partially qualified domain
       names.   The prior mechanisms could fail under a number of
       situations, especially when then local nameserver did  not
       have complete information.

       The  following signals have the specified effect when sent
       to the server process using the _k_i_l_l(1) command.

       SIGHUP Causes  server  to  read  named.boot   and   reload
              database.    If   the  server  is  built  with  the
              FORCED_RELOAD compile-time option, then SIGHUP will
              also cause the server to check the serial number on
              all secondary zones.  Normally the  serial  numbers
              are only checked at the SOA-specified intervals.

       SIGINT Dumps    current    data    base   and   cache   to
              /var/tmp/named_dump.db

       SIGIOT Dumps statistics data into /var/tmp/named.stats  if
              the server is compiled -DSTATS.  Statistics data is
              appended to the file.

       SIGSYS Dumps the profiling data in /var/tmp if the  server
              is  compiled  with  profiling (server forks, chdirs
              and exits).

       SIGTERM
              Dumps the primary  and  secondary  database  files.
              Used  to  save  modified  data  on  shutdown if the
              server is compiled with dynamic updating enabled.

       SIGUSR1
              Turns on debugging; each SIGUSR1  increments  debug
              level.  (SIGEMT on older systems without SIGUSR1)

       SIGUSR2
              Turns  off  debugging completely.  (SIGFPE on older
              systems without SIGUSR2)

       SIGWINCH
              Toggles logging of all incoming  queries  via  sys­
              log(8) (requires server to have been built with the
              QRYLOG option).
