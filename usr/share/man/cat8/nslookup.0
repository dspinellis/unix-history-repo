     nslookup - query Internet name servers interactively

     _N_s_l_o_o_k_u_p is a program to query Internet domain name servers.
     Nslookup has two modes: interactive and non-interactive.
     Interactive mode allows the user to query name servers for
     information about various hosts and domains or to print a
     list of hosts in a domain. Non-interactive mode is used to
     print just the name and requested information for a host or
     domain.


AARRGGUUMMEENNTTSS
     Interactive mode is entered in the following cases:

     a)  when no arguments are given (the default name server
	 will be used),

     b)  when the first argument is a hyphen (-) and the second
	 argument is the host name or Internet address of a name
	 server.

     Non-interactive mode is used when the name or Internet
     address of the host to be looked up is given as the first
     argument. The optional second argument specifies the host
     name or address of a name server.

     The options listed under the ``set'' command below can be
     specified in the .nslookuprc file in the user's home direc-
     tory if they are listed one per line. Options can also be
     specified on the command line if they precede the arguments
     and are prefixed with a hyphen. For example, to change the
     default query type to host information, and the initial
     timeout to 10 seconds, type:
	  nslookup -query=hinfo  -timeout=10

     Commands may be interrupted at any time by typing a
     control-C.  To exit, type a control-D (EOF) or type exit.
     The command line length must be less than 256 characters.
     To treat a built-in command as a host name, precede it with
     an escape character (\). NN..BB.. an unrecognized command will
     be interpreted as a host name.

     _h_o_s_t [_s_e_r_v_e_r]
	  Look up information for _h_o_s_t using the current default
	  server or using _s_e_r_v_e_r if specified.	If _h_o_s_t is an
	  Internet address and the query type is A or PTR, the

	  name of the host is returned.  If _h_o_s_t is a name and
	  does not have a trailing period, the default domain
	  name is appended to the name. (This behavior depends on
	  the state of the sseett options ddoommaaiinn, ssrrcchhlliisstt, ddeeffnnaammee,
	  and sseeaarrcchh).	To look up a host not in the current
	  domain, append a period to the name.


     sseerrvveerr _d_o_m_a_i_n
     llsseerrvveerr _d_o_m_a_i_n
	  Change the default server to _d_o_m_a_i_n. LLsseerrvveerr uses the
	  initial server to look up information about _d_o_m_a_i_n
	  while sseerrvveerr uses the current default server. If an
	  authoritative answer can't be found, the names of
	  servers that might have the answer are returned.


     rroooott Changes the default server to the server for the root
	  of the domain name space.  Currently, the host
	  ns.nic.ddn.mil is used.  (This command is a synonym for
	  llsseerrvveerr nnss..nniicc..ddddnn..mmiill..) The name of the root server
	  can be changed with the sseett rroooott command.

     ffiinnggeerr [_n_a_m_e] [>>>> _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e]
	  Connects with the finger server on the current host.
	  The current host is defined when a previous lookup for
	  a host was successful and returned address information
	  (see the sseett qquueerryyttyyppee==AA command).  _N_a_m_e is optional. >>
	  and >>>> can be used to redirect output in the usual
	  manner.


     llss [_o_p_t_i_o_n] _d_o_m_a_i_n [>> _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e]

	  List the information available for _d_o_m_a_i_n, optionally
	  creating or appending to _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.  The default output
	  contains host names and their Internet addresses.
	  _O_p_t_i_o_n can be one of the following:

	  --tt _q_u_e_r_y_t_y_p_e
	      lists all records of the specified type (see
	      _q_u_e_r_y_t_y_p_e below).

     sseett _k_e_y_w_o_r_d[=_v_a_l_u_e]
	  This command is used to change state information that
	  affects the lookups.	Valid keywords are:

	  aallll  Prints the current values of the frequently-used
	       options to sseett.	Information about the  current
	       default server and host is also printed.

	  ccllaassss==_v_a_l_u_e
	       Change the query class to one of:

	       IN	 the Internet class.

	       CHAOS	 the Chaos class.

	       HESIOD	 the MIT Athena Hesiod class.

	       ANY	 wildcard (any of the above).

	       The class specifies the protocol group of the
	       information.

	       Turn debugging mode on. A lot more information is
	       printed about the packet sent to the server and
	       the resulting answer.

	       Turn exhaustive debugging mode on.  Essentially
	       all fields of every packet are printed.
	       (Default = nod2)

	  ddoommaaiinn==_n_a_m_e
	       Change the default domain name to _n_a_m_e. The
	       default domain name is appended to a lookup
	       request depending on the state of the ddeeffnnaammee and
	       sseeaarrcchh options.	The domain search list contains
	       the parents of the default domain if it has at
	       least two components in its name. For example, if
	       the default domain is CC.Berkeley.EDU, the search
	       list is CC.Berkeley.EDU and Berkeley.EDU.  Use the
	       sseett ssrrcchhlliisstt command to specify a different list.
	       Use the sseett aallll command to display the list.
	       (Default = value from hostname, /etc/resolv.conf
	       or LOCALDOMAIN, abbreviation = do)

	  ssrrcchhlliisstt==_n_a_m_e_1/_n_a_m_e_2/...
	       Change the default domain name to _n_a_m_e_1 and the
	       domain search list to _n_a_m_e_1, _n_a_m_e_2, etc. A maximum
	       of 6 names separated by slashes (/) can be speci-
	       fied.  For example,
		   set srchlist=lcs.MIT.EDU/ai.MIT.EDU/MIT.EDU
	       sets the domain to lcs.MIT.EDU and the search list
	       to the three names.  This command overrides the
	       default domain name and search list of the sseett
	       ddoommaaiinn command.	Use the sseett aallll command to
	       display the list.
	       (Default = value based on hostname,
	       /etc/resolv.conf or LOCALDOMAIN, abbreviation =
	       srchl)

	  [[nnoo]]ddeeffnnaammee
	       If set, append the default domain name to a
	       single-component lookup request (i.e., one that
	       does not contain a period).
	       (Default = defname, abbreviation = [no]def)

	  [[nnoo]]sseeaarrcchh
	       If the lookup request contains at least one period
	       but doesn't end with a trailing period, append the
	       domain names in the domain search list to the
	       request until an answer is received.
	       (Default = search, abbreviation = [no]sea)

	  ppoorrtt==_v_a_l_u_e
	       Change the default TCP/UDP name server port to
	       _v_a_l_u_e.

	  ttyyppee==_v_a_l_u_e

	  No name server is running on the server machine.

	  The server does not have resource records of the
