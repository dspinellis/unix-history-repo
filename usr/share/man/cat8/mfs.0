     NNeewwffss replaces the more obtuse mkfs(8) program.  Before running nneewwffss or
     mmoouunntt__mmffss, the disk must be labeled using disklabel(8).  NNeewwffss builds a
     file system on the specified special device basing its defaults on the
     information in the disk label.  Typically the defaults are reasonable,
     however nneewwffss has numerous options to allow the defaults to be selective-
     ly overridden.

     MMoouunntt__mmffss is used to build a file system in virtual memory and then mount
     it on a specified node.  MMoouunntt__mmffss exits and the contents of the file
     system are lost when the file system is unmounted.  If mmoouunntt__mmffss is sent
     a signal while running, for example during system shutdown, it will at-
     tempt to unmount its corresponding file system.  The parameters to
     mmoouunntt__mmffss are the same as those to nneewwffss. The special file is only used
     to read the disk label which provides a set of configuration parameters
     for the memory based file system.  The special file is typically that of
     the primary swap area, since that is where the file system will be backed
     up when free memory gets low and the memory supporting the file system
     has to be paged.

     The following options define the general layout policies.

     --NN          Causes the file system parameters to be printed out without
                 really creating the file system.

     --OO          Creates an 4.3BSD format filesystem.  This options is primar-
                 ily used to build root filesystems that can be understood by
                 older boot ROMs.

     --bb _b_l_o_c_k_-_s_i_z_e
                 The block size of the file system in bytes.

     --ff _f_r_a_g_-_s_i_z_e
                 The fragment size of the file system in bytes.

     --mm _f_r_e_e _s_p_a_c_e _%
                 The percentage of space reserved from normal users; the mini-
                 mum free space threshold.  The default value used is 10%.
                 See tunefs(8) for more details on how to set this option.

     --oo _o_p_t_i_m_i_z_a_t_i_o_n _p_r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e
                 (``space'' or ``time'') The file system can either be in-
                 structed to try to minimize the time spent allocating blocks,
                 or to try to minimize the space fragmentation on the disk.
                 If the value of minfree (see above) is less than 10%, the de-
                 fault is to optimize for space; if the value of minfree
                 greater than or equal to 10%, the default is to optimize for
                 time.  See tunefs(8) for more details on how to set this op-
                 tion.

     --aa _m_a_x_c_o_n_t_i_g
                 This specifies the maximum number of contiguous blocks that
                 will be laid out before forcing a rotational delay (see --dd
                 below).  The default value is one.  See tunefs(8) for more


                 details on how to set this option.

     --dd _r_o_t_d_e_l_a_y
                 This specifies the expected time (in milliseconds) to service
                 a transfer completion interrupt and initiate a new transfer
                 on the same disk.  The default is 4 milliseconds.  See
                 tunefs(8) for more details on how to set this option.

     --ee _m_a_x_b_p_g   This indicates the maximum number of blocks any single file
                 can allocate out of a cylinder group before it is forced to
                 begin allocating blocks from another cylinder group.  The de-
                 fault is about one quarter of the total blocks in a cylinder
                 group.  See tunefs(8) for more details on how to set this op-
                 tion.

     --ii _n_u_m_b_e_r _o_f _b_y_t_e_s _p_e_r _i_n_o_d_e
                 This specifies the density of inodes in the file system.  The
                 default is to create an inode for each 2048 bytes of data
                 space.  If fewer inodes are desired, a larger number should
                 be used; to create more inodes a smaller number should be
                 given.

     --cc _#_c_y_l_i_n_d_e_r_s_/_g_r_o_u_p
                 The number of cylinders per cylinder group in a file system.
                 The default value used is 16.

     --ss _s_i_z_e     The size of the file system in sectors.

                 The following options override the standard sizes for the
                 disk geometry.  Their default values are taken from the disk
                 label.  Changing these defaults is useful only when using
                 nneewwffss to build a file system whose raw image will eventually
                 be used on a different type of disk than the one on which it
                 is initially created (for example on a write-once disk).
                 Note that changing any of these values from their defaults
                 will make it impossible for fsck to find the alternate su-
                 perblocks if the standard super block is lost.

     --rr _r_e_v_o_l_u_t_i_o_n_s_/_m_i_n_u_t_e
                 The speed of the disk in revolutions per minute.

     --SS _s_e_c_t_o_r_-_s_i_z_e
                 The size of a sector in bytes (almost never anything but
                 512).

     --uu _s_e_c_t_o_r_s_/_t_r_a_c_k
                 The number of sectors per track available for data allocation
                 by the file system.  This does not include sectors reserved
                 at the end of each track for bad block replacement (see --pp
                 below).

     --tt _#_t_r_a_c_k_s_/_c_y_l_i_n_d_e_r
                 The number of tracks/cylinder available for data allocation
                 by the file system.

     --pp _s_p_a_r_e _s_e_c_t_o_r_s _p_e_r _t_r_a_c_k
                 Spare sectors (bad sector replacements) are physical sectors
                 that occupy space at the end of each track.  They are not
                 counted as part of the sectors/track (--uu) since they are not
                 available to the file system for data allocation.

     --xx _s_p_a_r_e _s_e_c_t_o_r_s _p_e_r _c_y_l_i_n_d_e_r
                 Spare sectors (bad sector replacements) are physical sectors
                 that occupy space at the end of the last track in the cylin-
                 der.  They are deducted from the sectors/track (--uu) of the
                 last track of each cylinder since they are not available to

                 the file system for data allocation.

     --ll _h_a_r_d_w_a_r_e _s_e_c_t_o_r _i_n_t_e_r_l_e_a_v_e
                 Used to describe perturbations in the media format to compen-
                 sate for a slow controller.  Interleave is physical sector
                 interleave on each track, specified as the denominator of the
                 ratio:
                       sectors read/sectors passed over
                 Thus an interleave of 1/1 implies contiguous layout, while
                 1/2 implies logical sector 0 is separated by one sector from
                 logical sector 1.

     --kk _s_e_c_t_o_r _0 _s_k_e_w, _p_e_r _t_r_a_c_k
                 Used to describe perturbations in the media format to compen-
                 sate for a slow controller.  Track skew is the offset of sec-
                 tor 0 on track N relative to sector 0 on track N-1 on the
                 same cylinder.

     The following option applies only to mmoouunntt__mmffss.

     --FF _m_o_u_n_t _f_l_a_g_s
                 Used to pass in a decimal numeric value to be passed as mount
                 flags when running as a memory based file system.  This op-
                 tion is primarily intended for use when mmoouunntt__mmffss is started
                 by the mount(8) command.
