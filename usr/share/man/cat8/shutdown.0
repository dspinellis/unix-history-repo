     SShhuuttddoowwnn provides an automated shutdown procedure for super-users to
     nicely notify users when the system is shutting down, saving them from
     system administrators, hackers, and gurus, who would otherwise not bother
     with such niceties.

     Available friendlinesses:

     --ff    SShhuuttddoowwnn arranges, in the manner of fastboot(8),  for the file sys-
           tems _n_o_t _t_o _b_e checked on reboot.

     --hh    The system is halted at the specified _t_i_m_e when sshhuuttddoowwnn execs
           halt(8).

     --kk    Kick every body off.  The --kk option does not actually halt the sys-
           tem, but leaves the system multi-user with logins disabled (for all
           but super-user).

     --nn    Prevent the normal sync(2) before stopping.

     --rr    SShhuuttddoowwnn execs reboot(8) at the specified _t_i_m_e.

     _t_i_m_e  _T_i_m_e is the time at which sshhuuttddoowwnn will bring the system down and
           may be the word _n_o_w (indicating an immediate shutdown) or specify a
           future time in one of two formats: _+_n_u_m_b_e_r, or _y_y_m_m_d_d_h_h_m_m, where
           the year, month, and day may be defaulted to the current system
           values.  The first form brings the system down in _n_u_m_b_e_r minutes
           and the second at the absolute time specified.

     _w_a_r_n_i_n_g_-_m_e_s_s_a_g_e
           Any other arguments comprise the warning message that is broadcast
           to users currently logged into the system.

     --     If `--' is supplied as an option, the warning message is read from
           the standard input.

     At intervals, becoming more frequent as apocalypse approaches and start-
     ing at ten hours before shutdown, warning messages are displayed on the
     terminals of all users logged in.  Five minutes before shutdown, or imme-
     diately if shutdown is in less than 5 minutes, logins are disabled by
     creating _/_e_t_c_/_n_o_l_o_g_i_n and copying the warning message there.  If this
     file exists when a user attempts to log in, login(1) prints its contents
     and exits.  The file is removed just before sshhuuttddoowwnn exits.

     At shutdown time a message is written in the system log, containing the
     time of shutdown, who initiated the shutdown and the reason.  A terminate
     signal is then sent to init to bring the system down to single-user state
     (depending on above options).  The time of the shutdown and the warning
     message are placed in _/_e_t_c_/_n_o_l_o_g_i_n and should be used to inform the users
     about when the system will be back up and why it is going down (or any-
     thing else).
