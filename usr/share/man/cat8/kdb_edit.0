     _k_d_b__e_d_i_t is used to create or change principals stored in
     the Kerberos key distribution center (KDC) database.

     When executed, _k_d_b__e_d_i_t prompts for the master key string
     and verifies that it matches the master key stored in the
     database.	If the --nn option is specified, the master key is
     instead fetched from the master key cache file.

     Once the master key has been verified, _k_d_b__e_d_i_t begins a
     prompt loop.  The user is prompted for the principal and
     instance to be modified.  If the entry is not found the user
     may create it.  Once an entry is found or created, the user
     may set the password, expiration date, maximum ticket life-
     time, and attributes.  Default expiration dates, maximum
     ticket lifetimes, and attributes are presented in brackets;
     if the user presses return the default is selected.  There
     is no default password.  The password RANDOM is interpreted
     specially, and if entered the user may have the program
     select a random DES key for the principal.

     Upon successfully creating or changing the entry, ``Edit
     O.K.'' is printed.
