     power-up or after crashes.  An automatic consistency check of the file
     systems will be performed, and unless this fails, the system will resume
     multi-user operations.

     CCoolldd ssttaarrttss.. These are processor-type dependent.  On the CCI Power 6/32
     and related processors, the system will do a standard autoboot from drive
     0 upon power-up or reset.  This automatic boot may be cancelled by typing
     a `#' in the first few seconds after reset.  This enters console mode;
     the console prompt is `>' or `#'. The boot flags can be set to any hex-
     adecimal value --nn with the command

           #> p23 _n.

     The default device may be examined or set; see the Diagnostics and Debug-
     ging manual for the processor for details on device naming and syntax.
     After setting the boot flags and/or device, a bootstrap sequence can be
     initiated with

           #> fb

     A specific device or bootstrap file may be used; for example,

           #> fb xfd(1,0)

     would boot from the `a' partition on XFD drive 1.

     The file specifications used for the boostrap when loaded with the
     ``askme'' flag (register 23 set to 1 or 3) are of the form:

           device(adaptor,controller,unit,minor)

     where _d_e_v_i_c_e is the type of the device to be searched, _a_d_a_p_t_o_r is number
     of the VERSAbus (or VMEbus) to which the device is attached, _c_o_n_t_r_o_l_l_e_r
     is the unit number of the controller on that buss, _u_n_i_t is the unit num-
     ber of the disk or tape, and _m_i_n_o_r is the disk partition or tape file
     number.  Leading adaptor or controller numbers default to 0.  Normal line
     editing characters can be used when typing the file specification.  The
     following list of supported devices may vary from installation to instal-
     lation:

           dk   SMD or ESDI disks on VDDC or SMD-E
           cy   tape on Ciprico Tapemaster controller

     For example, to boot from a file system which starts at cylinder 0 of
     unit 0 of an SMD-E disk, type `dk(0,0)vmunix' to the boot prompt;
     `dk(2,1,0)vmunix' would specify drive 1 on SMD-E controller 2.

     In an emergency, the bootstrap methods described in the paper _I_n_s_t_a_l_l_i_n_g
     _a_n_d _O_p_e_r_a_t_i_n_g _4_._3 _B_S_D_-_t_a_h_o_e _U_N_I_X _o_n _t_h_e _T_a_h_o_e can be used to boot from a
     distribution tape.

     The disklabel format used by some versions of the console processor is
     different than the format used by UNIX and the bootstrap.
