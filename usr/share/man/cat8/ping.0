     _P_i_n_g uses the ICMP protocol's mandatory ECHO_REQUEST
     datagram to elicit an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host or
     gateway.  ECHO_REQUEST datagrams (``pings'') have an IP and
     ICMP header, followed by a _s_t_r_u_c_t _t_i_m_e_v_a_l and then an arbi-
     trary number of ``pad'' bytes used to fill out the packet.
     The options are as follows: Other options are:

     -_c _c_o_u_n_t
	  Stop after sending (and receiving) _c_o_u_n_t ECHO_RESPONSE
	  packets.

     -_d   Set the SO_DEBUG option on the socket being used.

     -_f   Flood ping.  Outputs packets as fast as they come back
	  or one hundred times per second, whichever is more.
	  For every ECHO_REQUEST sent a period ``.'' is printed,
	  while for ever ECHO_REPLY received a backspace is
	  printed.  This provides a rapid display of how many
	  packets are being dropped.  Only the super-user may use
	  this option.	_T_h_i_s _c_a_n _b_e _v_e_r_y _h_a_r_d _o_n _a _n_e_t_w_o_r_k _a_n_d

	  default is to wait for one second between each packet.
	  This option is incompatible with the -_f option.

     -_l _p_r_e_l_o_a_d
	  If _p_r_e_l_o_a_d is specified, _p_i_n_g sends that many packets
	  as fast as possible before falling into its normal mode
	  of behavior.

     -_n   Numeric output only.	No attempt will be made to lookup
	  symbolic names for host addresses.

     -_p _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
	  You may specify up to 16 ``pad'' bytes to fill out the
	  packet you send.  This is useful for diagnosing data-
	  dependent problems in a network.  For example, ``-p
	  ff'' will cause the sent packet to be filled with all
	  ones.

     -_q   Quiet output.  Nothing is displayed except the summary
	  lines at startup time and when finished.

     --RR   Record route.  Includes the RECORD_ROUTE option in the
	  ECHO_REQUEST packet and displays the route buffer on
	  returned packets.  Note that the IP header is only
	  large enough for nine such routes.  Many hosts ignore
	  or discard this option.

     -_r   Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a
	  host on an attached network.	If the host is not on a
	  directly-attached network, an error is returned.  This
	  option can be used to ping a local host through an
	  interface that has no route through it (e.g., after the
	  interface was dropped by _r_o_u_t_e_d(8)).

     -_s _p_a_c_k_e_t_s_i_z_e
	  Specifies the number of data bytes to be sent. The
	  default is 56, which translates into 64 ICMP data bytes
	  when combined with the 8 bytes of ICMP header data.

     -_v   Verbose output.  ICMP packets other than ECHO_RESPONSE
	  that are received are listed.

     When using _p_i_n_g for fault isolation, it should first be run
     on the local host, to verify that the local network inter-
     face is up and running.  Then, hosts and gateways further
     and further away should be ``pinged''.  Round-trip times and
     packet loss statistics are computed.  If duplicate packets
     are received, they are not included in the packet loss cal-
     culation, although the round trip time of these packets is
     used in calculating the minimum/average/maximum round-trip
     time numbers.  When the specified number of packets have
     been sent (and received) or if the program is terminated
     with a SIGINT, a brief summary is displayed.

     This program is intended for use in network testing, meas-
     urement and management.  Because of the load it can impose
     on the network, it is unwise to use _p_i_n_g during normal
     operations or from automated scripts.

     An IP header without options is 20 bytes.	An ICMP
     ECHO_REQUEST packet contains an additional 8 bytes worth of
     ICMP header followed by an arbitrary amount of data.  When a
     _p_a_c_k_e_t_s_i_z_e is given, this indicated the size of this extra
     piece of data (the default is 56).  Thus the amount of data
     received inside of an IP packet of type ICMP ECHO_REPLY will
     always be 8 bytes more than the requested data space (the
     ICMP header).

     If the data space is at least eight bytes large, _p_i_n_g uses
     the first eight bytes of this space to include a timestamp
     which it uses in the computation of round trip times.  If
     less than eight bytes of pad are specified, no round trip

     _P_i_n_g will report duplicate and damaged packets.  Duplicate
     packets should never occur, and seem to be caused by inap-
     propriate link-level retransmissions.  Duplicates may occur
     in many situations and are rarely (if ever) a good sign,
     although the presence of low levels of duplicates may not
     always be cause for alarm.

     Damaged packets are obviously serious cause for alarm and
     often indicate broken hardware somewhere in the _p_i_n_g
     packet's path (in the network or in the hosts).

     The (inter)network layer should never treat packets dif-
     ferently depending on the data contained in the data por-
     tion.  Unfortunately, data-dependent problems have been
     known to sneak into networks and remain undetected for long
     periods of time.  In many cases the particular pattern that
     will have problems is something that doesn't have sufficient
     ``transitions'', such as all ones or all zeros, or a pattern
     right at the edge, such as almost all zeros.  It isn't
     necessarily enough to specify a data pattern of all zeros
     (for example) on the command line because the pattern that
     is of interest is at the data link level, and the relation-
     ship between what you type and what the controllers transmit
     can be complicated.

     This means that if you have a data-dependent problem you
     will probably have to do a lot of testing to find it.  If
     you are lucky, you may manage to find a file that either
     can't be sent across your network or that takes much longer
     to transfer than other similar length files.  You can then
     examine this file for repeated patterns that you can test
     using the -_p option of _p_i_n_g.

TTTTLL DDEETTAAIILLSS
     The TTL value of an IP packet represents the maximum number
     of IP routers that the packet can go through before being
     thrown away.  In current practice you can expect each router
     in the Internet to decrement the TTL field by exactly one.

     The TCP/IP specification states that the TTL field for TCP
     packets should be set to 60, but many systems use smaller
     values (4.3 BSD uses 30, 4.2 used 15).

     The maximum possible value of this field is 255, and most
     Unix systems set the TTL field of ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets
     to 255.  This is why you will find you can ``ping'' some
     hosts, but not reach them with _t_e_l_n_e_t or _f_t_p.

     In normal operation ping prints the ttl value from the
     packet it receives.  When a remote system receives a ping
     packet, it can do one of three things with the TTL field in
     its response:

     --   Not change it; this is what Berkeley Unix systems did
	  before the 4.3BSD-tahoe release.  In this case the TTL
	  value in the received packet will be 255 minus the
	  number of routers in the round-trip path.

     --   Set it to 255; this is what current Berkeley Unix sys-
	  tems do.  In this case the TTL value in the received
	  packet will be 255 minus the number of routers in the
	  path _f_r_o_m the remote system _t_o the _p_i_n_ging host.

     --   Set it to some other value.  Some machines use the same
	  value for ICMP packets that they use for TCP packets,
	  for example either 30 or 60.	Others may use completely
	  wild values.

BBUUGGSS
     Many Hosts and Gateways ignore the RECORD_ROUTE option.

     The maximum IP header length is too small for options like
     RECORD_ROUTE to be completely useful.  There's not much that
     that can be done about this, however.

     Flood pinging is not recommended in general, and flood ping-
     ing the broadcast address should only be done under very
     controlled conditions.
