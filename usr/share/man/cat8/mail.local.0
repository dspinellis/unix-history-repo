     MMaaiill..llooccaall reads the standard input up to an end-of-file and appends it
     to each _u_s_e_r _'_s _m_a_i_l file.  The _u_s_e_r must be a valid user name.

     The options are as follows:

     --ff _f_r_o_m  Specify the sender's name.

     Individual mail messages in the mailbox are delimited by an empty line
     followed by a line beginning with the string ``From ''.  A line contain-
     ing the string ``From '', the sender's name and a time stamp is prepended
     to each delivered mail message.  A blank line is appended to each mes-
     sage.  A greater-than character (``>'') is prepended to any line in the
     message which could be mistaken for a ``From '' delimiter line.

     The mail files are exclusively locked with flock(2) while mail is append-
     ed.

     If the ``biff'' service is returned by getservbyname(3),  the biff server
     is notified of delivered mail.

     The mmaaiill..llooccaall utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
