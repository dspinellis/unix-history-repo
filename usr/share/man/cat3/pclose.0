DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The ppooppeenn() function ``opens'' a process by creating an IPC connection,
     forking, and invoking the shell.  Historically, ppooppeenn was implemented
     with a unidirectional pipe; hence many implementations of ppooppeenn only al-
     low the _t_y_p_e argument to specify reading or writing, not both.  Since
     ppooppeenn is now implemented using sockets, the _t_y_p_e may request a bidirec-
     tional data flow.  The _t_y_p_e argument is a pointer to a null-terminated
     string which must be `r' for reading, `w' for writing, or `r+' for read-
     ing and writing.

     The _c_o_m_m_a_n_d argument is a pointer to a null-terminated string containing
     a shell command line.  This command is passed to _/_b_i_n_/_s_h using the --cc
     flag; interpretation, if any, is performed by the shell.

     The return value from ppooppeenn() is a normal standard I/O stream in all re-
     spects save that it must be closed with ppcclloossee() rather than ffcclloossee().
     Writing to such a stream writes to the standard input of the command; the
     command's standard output is the same as that of the process that called
     ppooppeenn(), unless this is altered by the command itself.  Conversely, read-
     ing from a ``popened'' stream reads the command's standard output, and
     the command's standard input is the same as that of the process that
     called ppooppeenn().

     Note that output ppooppeenn() streams are fully buffered by default.

     The ppcclloossee() function waits for the associated process to terminate and
     returns the exit status of the command as returned by wwaaiitt44().

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEE
     The ppooppeenn() function returns NULL if the fork(2),  pipe(2),  or socket-
     pair(2) calls fail, or if it cannot allocate memory.

     The ppcclloossee() function returns -1 if _s_t_r_e_a_m is not associated with a
     ``popened'' command, if _s_t_r_e_a_m already ``pclosed'', or if wait4 returns
     an error.

EERRRROORRSS
     The ppooppeenn() function does not reliably set _e_r_r_n_o.

     fork(2),  sh(1),  pipe(2),  socketpair(2),  wait4(2),  fflush(3),
     fclose(3),  fopen(3),  stdio(3),  system(3)

BBUUGGSS
     Since the standard input of a command opened for reading shares its seek
     offset with the process that called ppooppeenn(), if the original process has
     done a buffered read, the command's input position may not be as expect-
     ed.  Similarly, the output from a command opened for writing may become
     intermingled with that of the original process.  The latter can be avoid-
     ed by calling fflush(3) before ppooppeenn().


     Failure to execute the shell is indistinguishable from the shell's fail-
     ure to execute command, or an immediate exit of the command.  The only
     hint is an exit status of 127.

     The ppooppeenn() argument always calls sh,  never calls csh.

     A ppooppeenn() and a ppcclloossee() function appeared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX.
