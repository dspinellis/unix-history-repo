     _R_e_g_c_o_m_p, _r_e_g_e_x_e_c, _r_e_g_s_u_b, and _r_e_g_e_r_r_o_r implement _e_g_r_e_p(1)-
     style regular expressions and supporting facilities.

     _R_e_g_c_o_m_p compiles a regular expression into a structure of
     type _r_e_g_e_x_p, and returns a pointer to it.	The space has
     been allocated using _m_a_l_l_o_c(3) and may be released by _f_r_e_e.

     _R_e_g_e_x_e_c matches a NUL-terminated _s_t_r_i_n_g against the compiled
     regular expression in _p_r_o_g.  It returns 1 for success and 0
     for failure, and adjusts the contents of _p_r_o_g's _s_t_a_r_t_p and
     _e_n_d_p (see below) accordingly.

     The members of a _r_e_g_e_x_p structure include at least the fol-
     lowing (not necessarily in order):

	  char *startp[NSUBEXP];
	  char *endp[NSUBEXP];

     where _N_S_U_B_E_X_P is defined (as 10) in the header file.  Once a
     successful _r_e_g_e_x_e_c has been done using the _r_e_g_e_x_p, each
     _s_t_a_r_t_p-_e_n_d_p pair describes one substring within the _s_t_r_i_n_g,
     with the _s_t_a_r_t_p pointing to the first character of the sub-
     string and the _e_n_d_p pointing to the first character follow-
     ing the substring.  The 0th substring is the substring of
     _s_t_r_i_n_g that matched the whole regular expression.	The oth-
     ers are those substrings that matched parenthesized expres-
     sions within the regular expression, with parenthesized
     expressions numbered in left-to-right order of their opening
     parentheses.

     _R_e_g_s_u_b copies _s_o_u_r_c_e to _d_e_s_t, making substitutions according
     to the most recent _r_e_g_e_x_e_c performed using _p_r_o_g.  Each
     instance of `&' in _s_o_u_r_c_e is replaced by the substring indi-
     cated by _s_t_a_r_t_p[_0] and _e_n_d_p[_0].  Each instance of `\_n',
     where _n is a digit, is replaced by the substring indicated
     by _s_t_a_r_t_p[_n] and _e_n_d_p[_n].	To get a literal `&' or `\_n' into
     _d_e_s_t, prefix it with `\'; to get a literal `\' preceding `&'
     or `\_n', prefix it with another `\'.

     _R_e_g_e_r_r_o_r is called whenever an error is detected in _r_e_g_c_o_m_p,
     _r_e_g_e_x_e_c, or _r_e_g_s_u_b.  The default _r_e_g_e_r_r_o_r writes the string
     _m_s_g, with a suitable indicator of origin, on the standard
     error output and invokes _e_x_i_t(2).	_R_e_g_e_r_r_o_r can be replaced
     by the user if other actions are desirable.

     A regular expression is zero or more _b_r_a_n_c_h_e_s, separated by
     `|'.  It matches anything that matches one of the branches.

     A branch is zero or more _p_i_e_c_e_s, concatenated.  It matches a
     match for the first, followed by a match for the second,
     etc.

     A piece is an _a_t_o_m possibly followed by `*', `+', or `?'.
     An atom followed by `*' matches a sequence of 0 or more
     matches of the atom.  An atom followed by `+' matches a
     sequence of 1 or more matches of the atom.  An atom followed
     by `?' matches a match of the atom, or the null string.

     An atom is a regular expression in parentheses (matching a
     match for the regular expression), a _r_a_n_g_e (see below), `.'
     (matching any single character), `^' (matching the null
     string at the beginning of the input string), `$' (matching
     the null string at the end of the input string), a `\' fol-
     lowed by a single character (matching that character), or a
     single character with no other significance (matching that
     character).

     A _r_a_n_g_e is a sequence of characters enclosed in `[]'.  It
     normally matches any single character from the sequence.  If
     the sequence begins with `^', it matches any single charac-
     ter _n_o_t from the rest of the sequence.  If two characters in
     the sequence are separated by `-', this is shorthand for the
     full list of ASCII characters between them (e.g. `[0-9]'
     matches any decimal digit).  To include a literal `]' in the
     sequence, make it the first character (following a possible
     `^').  To include a literal `-', make it the first or last
     character.

     If a regular expression could match two different parts of
     the input string, it will match the one which begins

     earliest.	If both begin in the same place but match dif-
     ferent lengths, or match the same length in different ways,
     life gets messier, as follows.

     In general, the possibilities in a list of branches are con-
     sidered in left-to-right order, the possibilities for `*',
     `+', and `?' are considered longest-first, nested constructs
     are considered from the outermost in, and concatenated con-
     structs are considered leftmost-first.  The match that will
     be chosen is the one that uses the earliest possibility in
     the first choice that has to be made.  If there is more than
     one choice, the next will be made in the same manner (earli-
     est possibility) subject to the decision on the first
     choice.  And so forth.

     For example, `(ab|a)b*c' could match `abc' in one of two
     ways.  The first choice is between `ab' and `a'; since `ab'
     is earlier, and does lead to a successful overall match, it
     is chosen.  Since the `b' is already spoken for, the `b*'
     must match its last possibility-the empty string-since it
     must respect the earlier choice.

     In the particular case where no `|'s are present and there
     is only one `*', `+', or `?', the net effect is that the
     longest possible match will be chosen.  So `ab*', presented
     with `xabbbby', will match `abbbb'.  Note that if `ab*' is
     tried against `xabyabbbz', it will match `ab' just after
     `x', due to the begins-earliest rule.  (In effect, the deci-
     sion on where to start the match is the first choice to be
     made, hence subsequent choices must respect it even if this
     leads them to less-preferred alternatives.)

     _R_e_g_c_o_m_p returns NULL for a failure (_r_e_g_e_r_r_o_r permitting),
     where failures are syntax errors, exceeding implementation
     limits, or applying `+' or `*' to a possibly-null operand.

     Both code and manual page for _r_e_g_c_o_m_p, _r_e_g_e_x_e_c, _r_e_g_s_u_b, and
     _r_e_g_e_r_r_o_r were written at the University of Toronto.  They
     are intended to be compatible with the Bell V8 _r_e_g_e_x_p(3),
     but are not derived from Bell code.

BBUUGGSS
     Empty branches and empty regular expressions are not port-
     able to V8.

     The restriction against applying `*' or `+' to a possibly-
     null operand is an artifact of the simplistic implementa-
     tion.

     Does not support _e_g_r_e_p's newline-separated branches; neither
     does the V8 _r_e_g_e_x_p(3), though.

     Due to emphasis on compactness and simplicity, it's not
     strikingly fast.  It does give special attention to handling
     simple cases quickly.
