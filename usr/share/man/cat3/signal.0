     _S_i_g_n_a_l is a simplified interface to the more general _s_i_g_a_c_-
     _t_i_o_n(2) facility.

     A signal is generated by some abnormal event, initiated by a
     user at a terminal (quit, interrupt, stop), by a program
     error (bus error, etc.), by request of another program
     (kill), or when a process is stopped because it wishes to
     access its control terminal while in the background (see
     _t_t_y(4)).  Signals are optionally generated when a process
     resumes after being stopped, when the status of child
     processes changes, or when input is ready at the control
     terminal.	Most signals cause termination of the receiving
     process if no action is taken; some signals instead cause
     the process receiving them to be stopped, or are simply dis-
     carded if the process has not requested otherwise.  Except
     for the SIGKILL and SIGSTOP signals, the _s_i_g_n_a_l call allows
     signals either to be ignored or to cause an interrupt to a
     specified location.  The following is a list of all signals
     with names as in the include file <_s_i_g_n_a_l._h>:

     SIGHUP    1    hangup
     SIGINT    2    interrupt
     SIGQUIT   3*   quit
     SIGILL    4*   illegal instruction
     SIGTRAP   5*   trace trap
     SIGABRT   6*   _a_b_o_r_t() call (formerly SIGIOT)
     SIGEMT    7*   EMT instruction
     SIGFPE    8*   floating point exception
     SIGKILL   9    kill (cannot be caught or ignored)
     SIGBUS    10*  bus error
     SIGSEGV   11*  segmentation violation
     SIGSYS    12*  bad argument to system call
     SIGPIPE   13   write on a pipe with no one to read it
     SIGALRM   14   alarm clock
     SIGTERM   15   software termination signal
     SIGURG    16@  urgent condition present on socket
     SIGSTOP   17'|+'stop (cannot be caught or ignored)
     SIGTSTP   18'|+'stop signal generated from keyboard
     SIGCONT   19@  continue after stop
     SIGCHLD   20@  child status has changed
     SIGTTIN   21'|+'background read attempted from control terminal
     SIGTTOU   22'|+'background write attempted to control terminal

     SIGINFO   29@  status request from keyboard
     SIGUSR1   30   User defined signal 1
     SIGUSR2   31   User defined signal 2

     The starred signals in the list above cause a core image if
     not caught or ignored.

     If _f_u_n_c is SIG_DFL, the default action for signal _s_i_g is
     reinstated; this default is termination (with a core image
     for starred signals) except for signals marked with @ or
     '|+'.  Signals marked with @ are discarded if the action is
     SIG_DFL; signals marked with '|+' cause the process to stop.
     If _f_u_n_c is SIG_IGN the signal is subsequently ignored and
     pending instances of the signal are discarded.  Otherwise,
     when the signal occurs further occurrences of the signal are
     automatically blocked and _f_u_n_c is called.

     A return from the function unblocks the handled signal and
     continues the process at the point it was interrupted.

     If a caught signal occurs during certain system calls, caus-
     ing the call to terminate prematurely, the call is automati-
     cally restarted (the handler is installed using the
     SA_RESTART flag with _s_i_g_a_c_t_i_o_n(2)).  The affected system
     calls include _r_e_a_d(2), _w_r_i_t_e(2), _s_e_n_d_t_o(2), _r_e_c_v_f_r_o_m(2),
     _s_e_n_d_m_s_g(2) and _r_e_c_v_m_s_g(2) on a communications channel or a
     slow device (such as a terminal, but not a regular file) and
     during a _w_a_i_t(2) or _i_o_c_t_l(2).  However, calls that have
     already committed are not restarted, but instead return a
     partial success (for example, a short read count).

     The value of _s_i_g_n_a_l is the previous (or initial) value of
     _f_u_n_c for the particular signal.

     After a _f_o_r_k(2) or _v_f_o_r_k(2) the child inherits all signals.
     _E_x_e_c_v_e(2) resets all caught signals to the default action;
     ignored signals remain ignored.

     The previous action is returned on a successful call.  Oth-
     erwise, -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the
     error.

     _S_i_g_n_a_l will fail and no action will take place if one of the
     following occur:

     [EINVAL]	    _S_i_g is not a valid signal number.

     [EINVAL]	    An attempt is made to ignore or supply a
		    handler for SIGKILL or SIGSTOP.

     The handler routine can be declared:

	 void handler(sig, code, scp)

     Here _s_i_g is the signal number, into which the hardware
     faults and traps are mapped as defined below.  Code is a
     parameter which is either a constant as given below or, for
     compatibility mode faults, the code provided by the
     hardware. _S_c_p is a pointer to the _s_t_r_u_c_t _s_i_g_c_o_n_t_e_x_t used by
     the system to restore the process context from before the
     signal.  Compatibility mode faults are distinguished from
     the other SIGILL traps by having PSL_CM set in the psl.

     The following defines the mapping of hardware traps to sig-
     nals and codes.  All of these symbols are defined in
     <_s_i_g_n_a_l._h>:
