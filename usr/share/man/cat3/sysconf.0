     This interface is defined by IEEE Std1003.1-1988 (``POSIX''). A far more
     complete interface is available using sysctl(3).

     The ssyyssccoonnff() function provides a method for applications to determine
     the current value of a configurable system limit or option variable.  The
     _n_a_m_e argument specifies the system variable to be queried.  Symbolic con-
     stants for each name value are found in the include file <unistd.h>.

     The available values are as follows:

     _SC_ARG_MAX
             The maximum bytes of argument to exec(2).

     _SC_CHILD_MAX
             The maximum number of simultaneous processes per user id.

     _SC_CLK_TCK
             Number of micro-seconds per hz tick.

     _SC_NGROUPS_MAX
             The maximum number of supplemental groups.

     _SC_OPEN_MAX
             The maximum number of open files per user id.

     _SC_STREAM_MAX
             The minimum maximum number of streams that a process may have
             open at any one time.

     _SC_TZNAME_MAX
             The minimum maximum number of types supported for the name of a
             timezone.

     _SC_JOB_CONTROL
             Return 1 if job control is available on this system, otherwise
             -1.

     _SC_SAVED_IDS
             Returns 1 if saved set-group and saved set-user ID is available,
             otherwise -1.

     _SC_VERSION
             The version of ISO/IEC 9945 (POSIX 1003.1) with which the system
             attempts to comply.

     _SC_BC_BASE_MAX
             The maximum ibase/obase values in the bc(1) utility.

     _SC_BC_DIM_MAX
             The maximum array size in the bc(1) utility.

     _SC_BC_SCALE_MAX

             The maximum scale value in the bc(1) utility.

     _SC_BC_STRING_MAX
             The maximum string length in the bc(1) utility.

     _SC_COLL_WEIGHTS_MAX
             The maximum number of weights that can be assigned to any entry
             of the LC_COLLATE order keyword in the locale definition file.

     _SC_EXPR_NEST_MAX
             The maximum number of expressions that can be nested within
             parenthesis by the expr(1) utility.

     _SC_LINE_MAX
             The maximum length in bytes of a text-processing utility's input
             line.

     _SC_RE_DUP_MAX
             The maximum number of repeated occurrences of a regular expres-
             sion permitted when using interval notation.

     _SC_2_VERSION
             The version of POSIX 1003.2 with which the system attempts to
             comply.

     _SC_2_C_BIND
             Return 1 if the system's C-language development facilities sup-
             port the C-Language Bindings Option, otherwise -1.

     _SC_2_C_DEV
             Return 1 if the system supports the C-Language Development Utili-
             ties Option, otherwise -1.

     _SC_2_CHAR_TERM
             Return 1 if the system supports at least one terminal type capa-
             ble of all operations described in POSIX 1003.2, otherwise -1.

     _SC_2_FORT_DEV
             Return 1 if the system supports the FORTRAN Development Utilities
             Option, otherwise -1.

     _SC_2_FORT_RUN
             Return 1 if the system supports the FORTRAN Runtime Utilities Op-
             tion, otherwise -1.

     _SC_2_LOCALEDEF
             Return 1 if the system supports the creation of locales, other-
             wise -1.

     _SC_2_SW_DEV
             Return 1 if the system supports the Software Development Utili-
             ties Option, otherwise -1.

     _SC_2_UPE
             Return 1 if the system supports the User Portability Utilities
             Option, otherwise -1.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEESS
     If the call to ssyyssccoonnff is not successful, -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set
     appropriately.  Otherwise, if the variable is associated with funtionali-
     ty that is not supported, -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is not modified.  Oth-
     erwise, the current variable value is returned.

EERRRROORRSS
     The ssyyssccoonnff() function may fail and set _e_r_r_n_o for any of the errors spec-
     ified for the library functions sysctl(3).  In addition, the following

     errors may be reported:

     [EINVAL]      The value of the _n_a_m_e argument is invalid.

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
     sysctl(3)

BBUUGGSS
     The value for _SC_STREAM_MAX is a minimum maximum, and required to be the
     same as ANSI C's FOPEN_MAX, so the returned value is a ridiculously small
     and misleading number.

SSTTAANNDDAARRDDSS
     The ssyyssccoonnff() function conforms to IEEE Std1003.1-1988 (``POSIX'').

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     The ssyyssccoonnff function first appeared in 4.4BSD.
