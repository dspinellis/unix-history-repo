     The ffggeettss() function reads at most one less than the number of characters
     specified by size from the given _s_t_r_e_a_m and stores them in the string
     _s_t_r. Reading stops when a newline character is found, at end-of-file or
     error.  The newline, if any, is retained.  In any case a `\0' character
     is appended to end the string.

     The ggeettss() function is equivalent to ffggeettss() with an infinite size and a
     _s_t_r_e_a_m of _s_t_d_i_n, except that the newline character (if any) is not stored
     in the string.  It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the in-
     put line, if any, is sufficiently short to fit in the string.

     Upon successful completion, ffggeettss() and ggeettss() return a pointer to the
     string.  If end-of-file or an error occurs before any characters are
     read, they return NULL. The ffggeettss() and functions ggeettss() do not distin-
     guish between end-of-file and error, and callers must use feof(3) and
     ferror(3) to determine which occurred.

EERRRROORRSS
     [EBADF]  The given _s_t_r_e_a_m is not a readable stream.

     The function ffggeettss() may also fail and set _e_r_r_n_o for any of the errors
     specified for the routines fflush(3),  fstat(2),  read(2),  or malloc(3).


     The function ggeettss() may also fail and set _e_r_r_n_o for any of the errors
     specified for the routine getchar(3).

     The functions ffggeettss() and ggeettss() conform to ANSI C X3.159-1989 (``ANSI C
     '').

BBUUGGSS
     Since it is usually impossible to ensure that the next input line is less
     than some arbitrary length, and because overflowing the input buffer is
     almost invariably a security violation, programs should _N_E_V_E_R use ggeettss().
     The ggeettss() function exists purely to conform to ANSI C X3.159-1989
     (``ANSI C '').
