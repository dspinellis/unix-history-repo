     _M_a_l_l_o_c and _f_r_e_e provide a general-purpose memory allocation
     package.  _M_a_l_l_o_c returns a pointer to a block of at least
     _s_i_z_e bytes beginning on a word boundary.

     The argument to _f_r_e_e is a pointer to a block previously
     allocated by _m_a_l_l_o_c; this space is made available for
     further allocation, but its contents are left undisturbed.

     Needless to say, grave disorder will result if the space
     assigned by _m_a_l_l_o_c is overrun or if some random number is
     handed to _f_r_e_e.

     _M_a_l_l_o_c maintains multiple lists of free blocks according to
     size, allocating space from the appropriate list.	It calls
     _s_b_r_k (see _b_r_k(2)) to get more memory from the system when
     there is no suitable space already free.

     _R_e_a_l_l_o_c changes the size of the block pointed to by _p_t_r to
     _s_i_z_e bytes and returns a pointer to the (possibly moved)
     block.  The contents will be unchanged up to the lesser of
     the new and old sizes.  If _p_t_r is null, _r_e_a_l_l_o_c simply
     returns the value of _m_a_l_l_o_c called with an argument of _s_i_z_e.

     In order to be compatible with older versions, _r_e_a_l_l_o_c also
     works if _p_t_r points to a block freed since the last call of
     _m_a_l_l_o_c, _r_e_a_l_l_o_c or _c_a_l_l_o_c; sequences of _f_r_e_e, _m_a_l_l_o_c and
     _r_e_a_l_l_o_c were previously used to attempt storage compaction.
     This procedure is no longer recommended.

     _C_a_l_l_o_c allocates space for an array of _n_e_l_e_m elements of
     size _e_l_s_i_z_e. The space is initialized to zeros.

     _A_l_l_o_c_a allocates _s_i_z_e bytes of space in the stack frame of
     the caller.  This temporary space is automatically freed on
     return.

     Each of the allocation routines returns a pointer to space
     suitably aligned (after possible pointer coercion) for
     storage of any type of object.  If the space is of _p_a_g_e_s_i_z_e
     or larger, the memory returned will be page-aligned.

     _M_a_l_l_o_c, _r_e_a_l_l_o_c and _c_a_l_l_o_c return a null pointer (0) if
     there is no available memory or if the arena has been
     detectably corrupted by storing outside the bounds of a
     block.  _M_a_l_l_o_c may be recompiled to check the arena very
     stringently on every transaction; those sites with a source
     code license may check the source code to see how this can
     be done.

BBUUGGSS
     When _r_e_a_l_l_o_c returns 0, the block pointed to by _p_t_r may be
     destroyed.

     The current implementation of _m_a_l_l_o_c does not always fail
     gracefully when system memory limits are approached.  It may
     fail to allocate memory when larger free blocks could be
     broken up, or when limits are exceeded because the size is
     rounded up.  It is optimized for sizes that are powers of
     two.

     _A_l_l_o_c_a is machine dependent; its use is discouraged.
