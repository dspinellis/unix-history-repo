     The routine nnss__aaddddrr() interprets character strings representing XNS ad-
     dresses, returning binary information suitable for use in system calls.
     The routine nnss__nnttooaa() takes XNS addresses and returns ASCII strings rep-
     resenting the address in a notation in common use in the Xerox Develop-
     ment Environment:

           <network number>.<host number>.<port number>

     Trailing zero fields are suppressed, and each number is printed in hex-
     adecimal, in a format suitable for input to nnss__aaddddrr().  Any fields lack-
     ing super-decimal digits will have a trailing `H' appended.

     Unfortunately, no universal standard exists for representing XNS address-
     es.  An effort has been made to insure that nnss__aaddddrr() be compatible with
     most formats in common use.  It will first separate an address into 1 to
     3 fields using a single delimiter chosen from period `.', colon `:' or
     pound-sign `#'. Each field is then examined for byte separators (colon or
     period).  If there are byte separators, each subfield separated is taken
     to be a small hexadecimal number, and the entirety is taken as a network-
     byte-ordered quantity to be zero extended in the high-network-order
     bytes.  Next, the field is inspected for hyphens, in which case the field
     is assumed to be a number in decimal notation with hyphens separating the
     millenia.  Next, the field is assumed to be a number: It is interpreted
     as hexadecimal if there is a leading `0x' (as in C), a trailing `H' (as
     in Mesa), or there are any super-decimal digits present.  It is inter-
     preted as octal is there is a leading `0' and there are no super-octal
     digits.  Otherwise, it is converted as a decimal number.

     The nnss__aaddddrr() and nnss__ttooaa() functions appeared in 4.3BSD.

BBUUGGSS
     The string returned by nnss__nnttooaa() resides in a static memory area.  The
     function nnss__aaddddrr() should diagnose improperly formed input, and there
     should be an unambiguous way to recognize this.
