     The ssyyssccttll function retrieves system information and allows processes
     with appropriate privileges to set system information.  The information
     available from ssyyssccttll consists of integers, strings, and tables.  Infor-
     mation may be retrieved and set from the command interface using the
     sysctl(1) utility.

     Unless explicitly noted below, ssyyssccttll returns a consistent snapshot of
     the data requested.  Consistency is obtained by locking the destination
     buffer into memory so that the data may be copied out without blocking.
     Calls to ssyyssccttll are serialized to avoid deadlock.

     The state is described using a ``Management Information Base'' (MIB)
     style name, listed in _n_a_m_e, which is a _n_a_m_e_l_e_n length array of integers.

     The information is copied into the buffer specified by _o_l_d_p. The size of
     the buffer is given by the location specified by _o_l_d_l_e_n_p before the call,
     and that location gives the amount of data copied after a successful
     call.  If the amount of data available is greater than the size of the
     buffer supplied, the call supplies as much data as fits in the buffer
     provided and returns with the error code ENOMEM.  If the old value is not
     desired, _o_l_d_p and _o_l_d_l_e_n_p should be set to NULL.

     The size of the available data can be determined by calling ssyyssccttll with a
     NULL parameter for _o_l_d_p. The size of the available data will be returned
     in the location pointed to by _o_l_d_l_e_n_p. For some operations, the amount of
     space may change often.  For these operations, the system attempts to
     round up so that the returned size is large enough for a call to return
     the data shortly thereafter.

     To set a new value, _n_e_w_p is set to point to a buffer of length _n_e_w_l_e_n
     from which the requested value is to be taken.  If a new value is not to
     be set, _n_e_w_p should be set to NULL and _n_e_w_l_e_n set to 0.

     The top level names are defined with a CTL_ prefix in _<_s_y_s_/_s_y_s_c_t_l_._h_>, and
     are as follows.  The next and subsequent levels down are found in the in-
     clude files listed here, and described in separate sections below.

           CTL_VM            vm/vm_param.h             Virtual memory

     For example, the following retrieves the maximum number of processes al-
     lowed in the system:
           int mib[2], maxproc;
           size_t len;

           mib[0] = CTL_KERN;
           mib[1] = KERN_MAXPROC;
           len = sizeof(maxproc);
           sysctl(mib, 2, &maxproc, &len, NULL, 0);

     To retrieve the standard search path for the system utilities:
           int mib[2];
           size_t len;
           char *p;

           mib[0] = CTL_USER;
           mib[1] = USER_CS_PATH;
           sysctl(mib, 2, NULL, &len, NULL, 0);
           p = malloc(len);
           sysctl(mib, 2, p, &len, NULL, 0);

CCTTLL__DDEEBBUUGG
     The debugging variables vary from system to system.  A debugging variable
     may be added or deleted without need to recompile ssyyssccttll to know about
     it.  Each time it runs, ssyyssccttll gets the list of debugging variables from
     the kernel and displays their current values.  The system defines twenty
     (_s_t_r_u_c_t _c_t_l_d_e_b_u_g) variables named ddeebbuugg00 through ddeebbuugg1199. They are de-
     clared as separate variables so that they can be individually initialized
     at the location of their associated variable.  The loader prevents multi-
     ple use of the same variable by issuing errors if a variable is initial-
     ized in more than one place.  For example, to export the variable
     ddoossppeecciiaallcchheecckk as a debugging variable, the following declaration would
     be used:
           int dospecialcheck = 1;
           struct ctldebug debug5 = { "dospecialcheck", &dospecialcheck };

             names for the string and integer profiling information is de-
             tailed below.  The changeable column shows whether a process with
             appropriate privilege may change the value.

             GPROF_STATE
                     Returns GMON_PROF_ON or GMON_PROF_OFF to show that pro-
                     filing is running or stopped.

             GPROF_GMONPARAM
                     Structure giving the sizes of the above arrays.

     KERN_SAVED_IDS
             Returns 1 if saved set-group and saved set-user ID is available.

     KERN_SECURELVL
             The system security level.  This level may be raised by processes
             with appropriate privilege.  It may only be lowered by process 1.

     KERN_VDISABLE
             Returns the terminal character disabling value.

     KERN_VERSION
             The system version string.

     KERN_VNODE
             Return the entire vnode table.  Note, the vnode table is not nec-
             essarily a consistent snapshot of the system.  The returned data
             consists of an array whose size depends on the current number of
             such objects in the system.  Each element of the array contains
             the kernel address of a vnode _s_t_r_u_c_t _v_n_o_d_e _* followed by the vn-
             ode itself _s_t_r_u_c_t _v_n_o_d_e.

           PF_INET                    internet values        yes

     PF_ROUTE
             Return the entire routing table or a subset of it.  The data is
             returned as a sequence of routing messages (see route(4) for the
             header file, format and meaning).  The length of each message is
             contained in the message header.

             The third level name is a protocol number, which is currently al-
             ways 0.  The fourth level name is an address family, which may be
             set to 0 to select all address families.  The fifth and sixth
             level names are as follows:

     PF_INET
             Get or set various global information about the internet proto-
             cols.  The third level name is the protocol.  The fourth level
             name is the variable name.  The currently defined protocols and
             names are:

                   udp                    checksum            integer       yes

             The variables are as follows:

             ip.forwarding
                     Returns 1 when IP forwarding is enabled for the host,
                     meaning that the host is acting as a router.

             ip.redirect
                     Returns 1 when ICMP redirects may be sent by the host.
                     This option is ignored unless the host is routing IP
                     packets, and should normally be enabled on all systems.

             ip.ttl  The maximum time-to-live (hop count) value for an IP
                     packet sourced by the system.  This value applies to nor-
                     mal transport protocols, not to ICMP.

             icmp.maskrepl
                     Returns 1 if ICMP network mask requests are to be an-
                     swered.

             udp.checksum
                     Returns 1 when UDP checksums are being computed and
                     checked.  Disabling UDP checksums is strongly discour-
                     aged.
