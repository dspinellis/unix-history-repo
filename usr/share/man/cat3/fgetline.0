     The ffggeettlliinnee() function returns a pointer to the next line from the
     stream referenced by _s_t_r_e_a_m. This line is _n_o_t a C string as it does not
     end with a terminating NUL character.  The length of the line, including
     the final newline, is stored in the memory location to which _l_e_n points.
     (Note, however, that if the line is the last in a file that does not end
     in a newline, the returned text will not contain a newline.)

     Upon successful completion a pointer is returned; this pointer becomes
     invalid after the next I/O operation on _s_t_r_e_a_m (whether successful or
     not) or as soon as the stream is closed.  Otherwise, NULL is returned.
     The ffggeettlliinnee() function does not distinguish between end-of-file and er-
     ror; the routines feof(3) and ferror(3) must be used to determine which
     occurred.  If an error occurrs, the global variable _e_r_r_n_o is set to indi-
     cate the error.  The end-of-file condition is remembered, even on a ter-
     minal, and all subsequent attempts to read will return NULL until the
     condition is cleared with clearerr(3).

     The text to which the returned pointer points may be modified, provided
     that no changes are made beyond the returned size.  These changes are
     lost as soon as the pointer becomes invalid.

EERRRROORRSS
     [EBADF]  The argument _s_t_r_e_a_m is not a stream open for reading.

     The ffggeettlliinnee() function may also fail and set _e_r_r_n_o for any of the errors
     specified for the routines fflush(3),  malloc(3),  read(2),  stat(2),  or
     realloc(3).

     The ffggeettlliinnee() function first appeared in 4.4BSD.

4.4BSD                           June 9, 1993                                1
