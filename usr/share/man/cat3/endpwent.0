     _G_e_t_p_w_e_n_t, _g_e_t_p_w_u_i_d, and _g_e_t_p_w_n_a_m each return a pointer to a
     structure containing the broken-out fields of a line in the
     password file.  This structure is defined by the include
     file <pwd.h>, and contains the following fields:

	  struct passwd {
	       char *pw_name;		/* user name */
	       char *pw_passwd;         /* encrypted password */
	       uid_t	 pw_uid;	/* user uid */
	       gid_t	 pw_gid;	/* user gid */
	       time_t	 pw_change;	/* password change time */
	       char *pw_class;		/* user access class */
	       char *pw_gecos;		/* Honeywell login info */
	       char *pw_dir;		/* home directory */
	       char *pw_shell;		/* default shell */
	       time_t	 pw_expire;	/* account expiration */
	  };

     These fields are more completely described in _p_a_s_s_w_d(5).

     _G_e_t_p_w_n_a_m and _g_e_t_p_w_u_i_d search the password database for a
     matching user name or user uid, respectively, returning the
     first one encountered.  Identical user names or user uids
     may result in undefined behavior.

     _G_e_t_p_w_e_n_t sequentially reads the password database and is
     intended for programs that wish to step through the complete
     list of users.

     All three routines will open the password file for reading,
     if necessary.

     _S_e_t_p_w_f_i_l_e changes the default password file to _f_i_l_e, thus
     allowing the use of alternate password files.

     _S_e_t_p_a_s_s_e_n_t opens the file or rewinds it if it is already
     open.  If _s_t_a_y_o_p_e_n is non-zero, file descriptors are left
     open, significantly speeding up subsequent calls.	This
     functionality is unnecessary for _g_e_t_p_w_e_n_t as it doesn't
     close its file descriptors by default.  It should also be
     noted that it is dangerous for long-running programs to use
     this functionality as the password file may be updated by
     _c_h_p_a_s_s(1), _p_a_s_s_w_d(1), or _v_i_p_w(8).

     _S_e_t_p_w_e_n_t is identical to _s_e_t_p_a_s_s_e_n_t with an argument of
     zero.

     _E_n_d_p_w_e_n_t closes any open files.

     These routines have been written to ``shadow'' the password
     file, e.g.  allow only certain programs to have access to
     the encrypted password.  This is done by using the
     _m_k_p_a_s_s_w_d(8) program, which creates _n_d_b_m(3) databases that
     correspond to the password file, with the single exception
     that, rather than storing the encrypted password in the
     database, it stores the offset in the password file where
     the encrypted password may be found.  _G_e_t_p_w_e_n_t, _g_e_t_p_w_n_a_m,
     and _g_e_t_p_w_u_i_d will use the _n_d_b_m files in preference to the
     ``real'' password files, only reading the password file
     itself, to obtain the encrypted password, if the process is
     running with an effective user id equivalent to super-user.
     If the password file itself is protected, and the _n_d_b_m files
     are not, this makes the password available only to programs
     running with super-user privileges.

     The routines _g_e_t_p_w_e_n_t, _g_e_t_p_w_n_a_m, and _g_e_t_p_w_u_i_d, return a null
     pointer on EOF or error.  _S_e_t_p_a_s_s_e_n_t and _s_e_t_p_w_e_n_t return 0
     on failure and 1 on success.  _E_n_d_p_w_e_n_t and _s_e_t_p_w_f_i_l_e have no
     return value.

     All information is contained in a static buffer which is
     overwritten by each new call.  It must be copied elsewhere
     to be retained.

     Intermixing calls to _g_e_t_p_w_e_n_t with calls to _g_e_t_p_w_n_a_m or
     _g_e_t_p_w_u_i_d, or intermixing calls to _g_e_t_p_w_n_a_m and _g_e_t_p_w_u_i_d,
     after using _s_e_t_p_a_s_s_e_n_t to require that file descriptors be
     left open, may result in undefined behavior.

     The routines _g_e_t_p_w_e_n_t, _e_n_d_p_w_e_n_t, _s_e_t_p_a_s_s_e_n_t, and _s_e_t_p_w_e_n_t
     are fairly useless in a networked environment and should be
     avoided, if possible.
