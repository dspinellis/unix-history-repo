     SSttrrttoouull converts the string in _n_p_t_r to an uunnssiiggnneedd lloonngg
     value according to the given _b_a_s_e, which must be between 2
     and 36 inclusive, or be the special value 0.

     The string may begin with an arbitrary amount of white space
     (as determined by iissssppaaccee; see _c_t_y_p_e(3)), followed by a sin-
     gle optional `+' or `-' sign.  If _b_a_s_e is zero or 16, the
     string may then include a `0x' prefix, and the number will
     be read in base 16; otherwise, a zero _b_a_s_e is taken as 10
     (decimal) unless the next character is `0', in which case it
     is taken as 8 (octal).

     The remainder of the string is converted to an uunnssiiggnneedd lloonngg
     value in the obvious manner, stopping at the end of the
     string or at the first character that does not produce a
     valid digit in the given base.  (In bases above 10, the
     letter `A' in either upper or lower case represents 10, `B'
     represents 11, and so forth, with `Z' representing 35.)

     If _e_n_d_p_t_r is non nil, ssttrrttoouull stores the address of the
     first invalid character in *_e_n_d_p_t_r.  If there were no digits
     at all, however, ssttrrttoouull stores the original value of _n_p_t_r
     in *_e_n_d_p_t_r.  (Thus, if *_n_p_t_r is not '\0' but **_e_n_d_p_t_r is
     '\0' on return, the entire string was valid.)

     SSttrrttoouull returns either the result of the conversion or, if
     there was a leading minus sign, the negation of the result
     of the conversion, unless the original (non-negated) value
     would overflow; in the latter case, ssttrrttoouull returns
     UULLOONNGG__MMAAXX and sets eerrrrnnoo to EERRAANNGGEE.

	  The given string was out of range; the value converted
	  has been clamped.
