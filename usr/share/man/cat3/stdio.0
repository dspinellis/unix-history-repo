     The standard I/O library provides a simple and efficient buffered stream
     I/O interface.  Input and ouput is mapped into logical data streams and
     the physical I/O characteristics are concealed. The functions and macros
     are listed below; more information is available from the individual man
     pages.

     A stream is associated with an external file (which may be a physical de-
     vice) by _o_p_e_n_i_n_g a file, which may involve creating a new file. Creating
     an existing file causes its former contents to be discarded.  If a file
     can support positioning requests (such as a disk file, as opposed to a
     terminal) then a _f_i_l_e _p_o_s_i_t_i_o_n _i_n_d_i_c_a_t_o_r associated with the stream is
     positioned at the start of the file (byte zero), unless the file is
     opened with appened mode. If append mode is used, the position indicator
     will be placed the end-of-file.  The position indicator is maintained by
     subsequent reads, writes and positioning requests. All input occurs as if
     the characters were read by successive calls to the fgetc(3) function;
     all ouput takes place as if all characters were read by successive calls
     to the fputc(3) function.

     A file is disassociated from a stream by _c_l_o_s_i_n_g the file.  Ouput streams
     are flushed (any unwritten buffer contents are transfered to the host en-
     vironment) before the stream is disassociated from the file.  The value
     of a pointer to a FILE object is indeterminate after a file is closed
     (garbage).

     A file may be subsequently reopened, by the same or another program exe-
     cution, and its contents reclaimed or modified (if it can be repositioned
     at the start).  If the main function returns to its original caller, or
     the exit(3) function is called, all open files are closed (hence all out-
     put streams are flushed) before program termination.  Other methods of
     program termination, such as abort(3) do not bother about closing files
     properly.

     At program startup, three text streams are predefined and need not be
     opened explicitly -- _s_t_a_n_d_a_r_d _i_n_p_u_t (for reading converntional input), --
     _s_t_a_n_d_a_r_d _o_u_t_p_u_t (for writing converntional input), and _s_t_a_n_d_a_r_d _e_r_r_o_r
     (for writing diagnostic output).  These streams are abbreviated _s_t_d_i_n,
     _s_t_d_o_u_t and _s_t_d_e_r_r. When opened, the standard error stream is not fully
     buffered; the standard input and output streams are fully buffered if and
     only if the streams do not to refer to an interactive device.

     Output streams that refer to terminal devices are always line buffered by
     default; pending output to such streams is written automatically whenever
     an input stream that refers to a terminal device is read.  In cases where
     a large amount of computation is done after printing part of a line on an
     output terminal, it is necessary to fflush(3) the standard output before
     going off and computing so that the output will appear.

     The ssttddiioo library is a part of the library libc and routines are automat-
     ically loaded as needed by the compilers cc(1) and pc(1).  The SYNOPSIS
     sections of the following manual pages indicate which include files are
     to be used, what the compiler declaration for the function looks like and
     which external variables are of interest.

     The following are defined as macros; these names may not be re-used with-
     out first removing their current definitions with #undef: BUFSIZ, EOF,
     FILENAME_MAX, L_cuserid, L_ctermid, L_tmpnam, NULL, SEEK_END, SEEK_SET,
     SEE_CUR, TMP_MAX, clearerr, feof, ferror, fileno, fropen, fwopen, getc,
     getchar, putc, putchar, stderr, stdin, stdout. Function versions of the
     macro functions feof,  ferror,  clearerr,  fileno,  getc,  getchar,
     putc,  and putchar exist and will be used if the macros definitions are
     explicitly removed.

     The standard buffered functions do not interact well with certain other
     library and system functions, especially vfork and abort.
