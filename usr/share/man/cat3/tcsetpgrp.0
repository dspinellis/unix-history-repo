     If the process has a controlling terminal, the ttccsseettppggrrpp function sets
     the foreground process group ID associated with the terminal device to
     _p_g_r_p___i_d. The terminal device associated with _f_d must be the controlling
     terminal of the calling process and the controlling terminal must be cur-
     rently associated with the session of the calling process.  The value of
     _p_g_r_p___i_d must be the same as the process group ID of a process in the same
     session as the calling process.

     Upon successful completion, ttccsseettppggrrpp returns a value of zero.

     If an error occurs, ttccggeettppggrrpp returns -1 and the global variable _e_r_r_n_o is
     set to indicate the error, as follows:

     [EBADF]       The _f_d argument is not a valid file descriptor.

     [EINVAL]      An invalid value of _p_g_r_p___i_d was specified.

     [ENOTTY]      The calling process does not have a controlling terminal,
                   or the file represented by _f_d is not the controlling termi-
                   nal, or the controlling terminal is no longer associated
                   with the session of the calling process.

     [EPERM]       The _p_g_r_p___i_d argument does not match the process group ID of
                   a process in the same session as the calling process.
