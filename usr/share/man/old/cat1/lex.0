     lex - generator of lexical analysis programs

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     _L_e_x generates programs to be used in simple lexical analyis
     of text.  The input _f_i_l_e_s (standard input default) contain
     regular expressions to be searched for, and actions written
     in C to be executed when expressions are found.

     A C source program, 'lex.yy.c' is generated, to be compiled
     thus:

	  cc lex.yy.c -ll

     This program, when run, copies unrecognized portions of the
     input to the output, and executes the associated C action
     for each regular expression that is recognized.

     The options have the following meanings.

     --tt   Place the result on the standard output instead of in
	  file "lex.yy.c".

     --vv   Print a one-line summary of statistics of the generated
	  analyzer.

     --nn   Opposite of --vv; --nn is default.

     --ff   "Faster" compilation: don't bother to pack the result-
	  ing tables; limited to small programs.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEE
	  lex lexcommands

     would draw _l_e_x instructions from the file _l_e_x_c_o_m_m_a_n_d_s, and
     place the output in _l_e_x._y_y._c


	  %%
	  [A-Z] putchar(yytext[0]+'a'-'A');
	  [ ]+$ ;
	  [ ]+	putchar(' ');

     is an example of a _l_e_x program that would be put into a _l_e_x
     command file.  This program converts upper case to lower,
     removes blanks at the end of lines, and replaces multiple
     blanks by single blanks.
