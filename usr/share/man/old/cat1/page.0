       _M_o_r_e is a filter which allows examination of a  continuous
       text  one screenful at a time on a soft-copy terminal.  It
       normally pauses after each screenful, printing --More-- at
       the  bottom  of the screen.  If the user then types a car-
       riage return, one more line is  displayed.   If  the  user
       hits  a space, another screenful is displayed.  Other pos-
       sibilities are enumerated later.

       The command line options are:

       _-_n     An integer which is the size (in lines) of the win-
              dow which _m_o_r_e will use instead of the default.

       --cc     _M_o_r_e will draw each page by beginning at the top of
              the screen and erasing each  line  just  before  it
              draws  on  it.   This  avoids scrolling the screen,
              making it easier to read  while  _m_o_r_e  is  writing.
              This  option  will  be ignored if the terminal does
              not have the ability to clear to the end of a line.

       --dd     _M_o_r_e  will  prompt the user with the message "Press
              space to continue, 'q' to quit." at the end of each
              screenful,  and  will respond to subsequent illegal
              user input by  printing  "Press  'h'  for  instruc-
              tions."  instead of ringing the bell.  This is use-
              ful if _m_o_r_e is being used as a filter in some  set-
              ting,  such  as  a  class,  where many users may be
              unsophisticated.

       --ff     This causes _m_o_r_e  to  count  logical,  rather  than
              screen  lines.  That is, long lines are not folded.
              This option is recommended if _n_r_o_f_f output is being
              piped  through  _u_l_,  since  the latter may generate
              escape sequences.  These escape  sequences  contain
              characters  which  would  ordinarily  occupy screen
              positions, but which do not  print  when  they  are
              sent to the terminal as part of an escape sequence.
              Thus _m_o_r_e may think that lines are longer than they
              actually are, and fold lines erroneously.

       --ll     Do  not  treat  ^L  (form feed) specially.  If this

              option is not given, _m_o_r_e will pause after any line
              that  contains  a  ^L, as if the end of a screenful
              had been reached.  Also, if a file  begins  with  a
              form  feed,  the  screen will be cleared before the
              file is printed.

       --ss     Squeeze multiple blank lines from the output,  pro-
              ducing  only  one  blank  line.  Especially helpful
              when viewing _n_r_o_f_f output,  this  option  maximizes
              the useful information present on the screen.

       --uu     Normally, _m_o_r_e will handle underlining such as pro-
              duced by _n_r_o_f_f in a manner appropriate to the  par-
              ticular  terminal:   if  the  terminal  can perform
              underlining or has a stand-out mode, _m_o_r_e will out-
              put  appropriate  escape sequences to enable under-
              lining or stand-out mode for underlined information
              in  the source file.  The _-_u option suppresses this
              processing.

       ++_l_i_n_e_n_u_m_b_e_r
              Start up at _l_i_n_e_n_u_m_b_e_r.

       ++//_p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              Start up two lines before the line  containing  the
              regular expression _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.

       If  the  program  is  invoked  as _p_a_g_e_, then the screen is
       cleared before each screenful is printed (but  only  if  a
       full  screenful is being printed), and _k - 1 rather than _k
       - 2 lines are printed in each screenful, where  _k  is  the
       number of lines the terminal can display.

       _M_o_r_e  looks in the file _/_e_t_c_/_t_e_r_m_c_a_p to determine terminal
       characteristics, and to determine the default window size.
       On  a terminal capable of displaying 24 lines, the default
       window size is 22 lines.

       _M_o_r_e looks in the environment variable _M_O_R_E to pre-set any
       flags  desired.   For example, if you prefer to view files
       using the _-_c mode of operation,  the  _c_s_h  command  _s_e_t_e_n_v
       _M_O_R_E _-_c or the _s_h command sequence _M_O_R_E_=_'_-_c_' _; _e_x_p_o_r_t _M_O_R_E
       would cause all invocations of _m_o_r_e  _,  including  invoca-
       tions by programs such as _m_a_n and _m_s_g_s _, to use this mode.
       Normally, the user will place the command  sequence  which
       sets  up  the  _M_O_R_E  environment variable in the _._c_s_h_r_c or
       _._p_r_o_f_i_l_e file.

       If _m_o_r_e is reading from a file, rather than a pipe, then a
       percentage  is  displayed  along with the --More-- prompt.
       This gives the fraction of the file  (in  characters,  not

       Other  sequences  which may be typed when _m_o_r_e pauses, and
       their effects, are as follows (_i is  an  optional  integer
       argument, defaulting to 1) :


       _i<space>
              display  _i  more lines, (or another screenful if no
              argument is given)


       ^D     display 11 more lines  (a  ``scroll'').   If  _i  is
              given, then the scroll size is set to _i.

       _iz     same  as  typing a space except that _i, if present,
              becomes the new window size.

              (rather than a pipe), then the position in the file
              remains unchanged.  Otherwise, a screenful is  dis-
              played,  starting  two lines before the place where
              the expression was found.   The  user's  erase  and
              kill  characters  may  be  used to edit the regular
              expression.  Erasing back  past  the  first  column
              cancels the search command.


       _in     search  for the _i-th occurrence of the last regular
              expression entered.


       '      (single quote) Go to the point from which the  last
              search started.  If no search has been performed in
              the current file, this command  goes  back  to  the
              beginning of the file.


       !command
              invoke  a  shell  with _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.  The characters `%'
              and `!' in "command" are replaced with the  current
              file  name  and  the previous shell command respec-
              tively.  If there is no current file name,  `%'  is
              not  expanded.   The  sequences  "\%"  and "\!" are
              replaced by "%" and "!" respectively.


       _i:n    skip to the _i-th next file  given  in  the  command
              line (skips to last file if n doesn't make sense)


       _i:p    skip to the _i-th previous file given in the command
              line.  If this command is given in  the  middle  of
              printing  out  a  file,  then _m_o_r_e goes back to the
              beginning of the file. If  _i  doesn't  make  sense,
              _m_o_r_e  skips back to the first file.  If _m_o_r_e is not
              reading from a file, the bell is rung  and  nothing
              else happens.


       :f     display the current file name and line number.


       :q or :Q
              exit from _m_o_r_e (same as q or Q).

       The commands take effect immediately, i.e., it is not nec-
       essary to type a carriage return.  Up to the time when the
       command  character  itself  is given, the user may hit the
       line kill character to cancel the numerical argument being
       formed.  In addition, the user may hit the erase character
       to redisplay the --More--(xx%) message.

       At any time when output is being sent to the terminal, the
       user can hit the quit key (normally control-\).  _M_o_r_e will
       stop sending output, and will display the  usual  --More--
       prompt.  The user may then enter one of the above commands
       in the normal manner.  Unfortunately, some output is  lost
       when  this  is  done,  due to the fact that any characters
       waiting in the terminal's output queue  are  flushed  when
       the quit signal occurs.

       The terminal is set to _n_o_e_c_h_o mode by this program so that
       the output can be continuous.  What you type will thus not
       show on your terminal, except for the / and !  commands.

       If  the  standard output is not a teletype, then _m_o_r_e acts
       just like _c_a_t_, except that a header is printed before each
       file (if there is more than one).

       A sample usage of _m_o_r_e in previewing _n_r_o_f_f output would be
