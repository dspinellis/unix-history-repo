DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     A tutorial sampler for writing BSD manual pages with the --mmddoocc macro
     package, a _c_o_n_t_e_n_t-based and _d_o_m_a_i_n-based formatting package for
     troff(1).  Its predecessor, the -man(7) package, addressed page layout
     leaving the manipulation of fonts and other typesetting details to the
     individual author.  In --mmddoocc, page layout macros make up the _p_a_g_e
     _s_t_r_u_c_t_u_r_e _d_o_m_a_i_n which consists of macros for titles, section headers,
     displays and lists. Essentially items which affect the physical position
     of text on a formatted page.  In addition to the page structure domain,
     there are two more domains, the manual domain and the general text do-
     main.  The general text domain is defined as macros which perform tasks
     such as quoting or emphasizing pieces of text.  The manual domain is de-
     fined as macros that are a subset of the day to day informal language
     used to describe commands, routines and related BSD files.  Macros in the
     manual domain handle command names, command line arguments and options,
     function names, function parameters, pathnames, variables, cross refer-
     ences to other manual pages, and so on.  These domain items have value
     for both the author and the future user of the manual page.  It is hoped
     the consistency gained across the manual set will provide easier transla-
     tion to future documentation tools.

     Through out the UNIX manual pages, a manual entry is simply referred to
     as a man page, regardless of actual length and without sexist intention.

     The --mmddoocc package attempts to simplify the process of writing a man page.
     Theoretically, one should not have to learn the dirty details of troff(1)
     to use --mmddoocc; however, there are a few limitations which are unavoidable
     and best gotten out of the way.  And, too, be forewarned, this package is
     _n_o_t fast.

     As in troff(1),  a macro is called by placing a `.' (dot character) at
     the beginning of a line followed by the two character name for the macro.
     Arguments may follow the macro separated by spaces.  It is the dot char-
     acter at the beginning of the line which causes troff(1) to interpret the
     next two characters as a macro name.  To place a `.' (dot character) at
     the beginning of a line in some context other than a macro invocation,
     precede the `.' (dot) with the `\&' escape sequence.  The `\&' translates
     literally to a zero width space, and is never displayed in the output.

     In general, troff(1) macros accept up to nine arguments, any extra argu-
     ments are ignored.  Most macros in --mmddoocc accept nine arguments and, in
     limited cases, arguments may be continued or extended on the next line
     (See _E_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n_s). A few macros handle quoted arguments (see _P_a_s_s_i_n_g _S_p_a_c_e
     _C_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s _i_n _a_n _A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t below).

     Most of the --mmddoocc general text domain and manual domain macros are spe-
     cial in that their argument lists are _p_a_r_s_e_d for callable macro names.
     This means an argument on the argument list which matches a general text
     or manual domain macro name and is determined to be callable will be exe-
     cuted or called when it is processed.  In this case the argument, al-
     though the name of a macro, is not preceded by a `.' (dot).  It is in
     this manner that many macros are nested; for example the option macro,
     `.Op', may _c_a_l_l the flag and argument macros, `Fl' and `Ar', to specify
     an optional flag with an argument:

           [--ss _b_y_t_e_s]         is produced by .Op Fl s Ar bytes

     To prevent a two character string from being interpreted as a macro name,
     precede the string with the escape sequence `\&':

           [Fl s Ar bytes]    is produced by .Op \&Fl s \&Ar bytes

     Here the strings `Fl' and `Ar' are not interpreted as macros.  Macros
     whose argument lists are parsed for callable arguments are referred to as
     parsed and macros which may be called from an argument list are referred
     to as callable through out this document and in the companion quick ref-
     erence manual mdoc(7).  This is a technical _f_a_u_x _p_a_s as almost all of the
     macros in --mmddoocc are parsed, but as it was cumbersome to constantly refer
     to macros as being callable and being able to call other macros, the term
     parsed has been used.

     Sometimes it is desirable to give as one argument a string containing one
     or more blank space characters.  This may be necessary to defeat the nine
     argument limit or to specify arguments to macros which expect particular
     arrangement of items in the argument list.  For example, the function
     macro `.Fn' expects the first argument to be the name of a function and
     any remaining arguments to be function parameters.  As ANSI C stipulates
     the declaration of function parameters in the parenthesized parameter
     list, each parameter is guaranteed to be at minimum a two word string.
     For example, _i_n_t _f_o_o.

     There are two possible ways to pass an argument which contains an embed-
     ded space.  _I_m_p_l_e_m_e_n_t_a_t_i_o_n _n_o_t_e: Unfortunately, the most convenient way
     of passing spaces in between quotes by reassigning individual arguments
     before parsing was fairly expensive speed wise and space wise to imple-
     ment in all the macros for AT&T troff.  It is not expensive for groff but
     for the sake of portability, has been limited to the following macros
     which need it the most:

           Cd    Configuration declaration (section 4 _S_Y_N_O_P_S_I_S)
           Bl    Begin list (for the width specifier).
           Em    Emphasized text.
           Fn    Functions (sections two and four).
           It    List items.
           Li    Literal text.
           Sy    Symbolic text.
           %B    Book titles.
           %J    Journal names.
           %O    Optional notes for a reference.
           %R    Report title (in a reference).
           %T    Title of article in a book or journal.

     One way of passing a string containing blank spaces is to use the hard or
     unpaddable space character `\ ', that is, a blank space preceded by the
     escape character `\'. This method may be used with any macro but has the
     side effect of interfering with the adjustment of text over the length of
     a line.  Troff sees the hard space as if it were any other printable
     character and cannot split the string into blank or newline separated
     pieces as one would expect.  The method is useful for strings which are
     not expected to overlap a line boundary.  For example:

           ffeettcchh(_c_h_a_r _*_s_t_r)  is created by `.Fn fetch char\ *str'

           ffeettcchh(_c_h_a_r _*_s_t_r)  can also be created by `.Fn fetch "*char *str"'

     If the `\' or quotes were omitted, `.Fn' would see three arguments and
     the result would be:

           ffeettcchh(_c_h_a_r, _*_s_t_r)

     For an example of what happens when the parameter list overlaps a newline
     boundary, see the _B_U_G_S section.

     Troff can be confused by blank space characters at the end of a line.  It
     is a wise preventive measure to globally remove all blank spaces from
     <blank-space><end-of-line> character sequences.  Should the need arise to
     force a blank character at the end of a line, it may be forced with an
     unpaddable space and the `\&' escape character.  For example,
     `string\ \&'.

     Special characters like the newline character `\n', are handled by re-
     placing the `\' with `\e' (e.g.  `\en') to preserve the backslash.

     The body of a man page is easily constructed from a basic template found
     in the file:

     The first items in the template are the macros (.Dd, .Os, .Dt); the docu-
     ment date, the operating system the man page or subject source is devel-
     oped or modified for, and the man page title (_i_n _u_p_p_e_r _c_a_s_e) along with
     the section of the manual the page belongs in.  These macros identify the
     page, and are discussed below in _T_I_T_L_E _M_A_C_R_O_S.

     The remaining items in the template are section headers (.Sh); of which
     _N_A_M_E, _S_Y_N_O_P_S_I_S and _D_E_S_C_R_I_P_T_I_O_N are mandatory.  The headers are discussed
     in _P_A_G_E _S_T_R_U_C_T_U_R_E _D_O_M_A_I_N, after presentation of _M_A_N_U_A_L _D_O_M_A_I_N. Several
     content macros are used to demonstrate page layout macros; reading about
     content macros before page layout macros is recommended.

TTIITTLLEE MMAACCRROOSS
     The title macros are the first portion of the page structure domain, but
     are presented first and separate for someone who wishes to start writing
     a man page yesterday.  Three header macros designate the document title
     or manual page title, the operating system, and the date of authorship.
     These macros are one called once at the very beginning of the document
     and are used to construct the headers and footers only.

     .Dt DOCUMENT_TITLE section# [volume]
             The document title is the subject of the man page and must be in
             CAPITALS due to troff limitations.  The section number may be
             1, ..., 8, and if it is specified, the volume title may be omit-
             ted.  A volume title may be arbitrary or one of the following:

                   AMD    UNIX Ancestral Manual Documents
                   SMM    UNIX System Manager's Manual
                   URM    UNIX Reference Manual
                   PRM    UNIX Programmer's Manual

             The default volume labeling is URM for sections 1, 6, and 7; SMM
             for section 8; PRM for sections 2, 3, 4, and 5.

     .Os operating_system release#
             The name of the operating system should be the common acronym,
             e.g.  BSD or ATT. The release should be the standard release
             nomenclature for the system specified, e.g. 4.3, 4.3+Tahoe, V.3,
             V.4.  Unrecognized arguments are displayed as given in the page
             footer.  For instance, a typical footer might be:

                   .Os BSD 4.3

             or for a locally produced set

                   .Os CS Department

             The Berkeley default, `.Os' without an argument, has been defined
             as BSD Experimental in the site specific file
             _/_u_s_r_/_s_r_c_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_t_m_a_c_/_d_o_c_-_c_o_m_m_o_n. It really should default to
             LOCAL. Note, if the `.Os' macro is not present, the bottom left
             corner of the page will be ugly.

     .Dd month day, year
             The date should be written formally:

                   January 25, 1989

MMAANNUUAALL DDOOMMAAIINN
   WWhhaatt''ss iinn aa nnaammee......
     The manual domain macro names are derived from the day to day informal
     language used to describe commands, subroutines and related files.
     Slightly different variations of this language are used to describe the
     three different aspects of writing a man page.  First, there is the de-
     scription of --mmddoocc macro request usage.  Second is the description of a
     UNIX command _w_i_t_h --mmddoocc macros and third, the description a command to a
     user in the verbal sense; that is, discussion of a command in the text of
     a man page.

     In the first case, troff(1) macros are themselves a type of command; the
     general syntax for a troff command is:

           .Va argument1 argument2 ... argument9

     The `.Va' is a macro command or request, and anything following it is an
     argument to be processed.  In the second case, the description of a UNIX
     command using the content macros is a bit more involved; a typical
     _S_Y_N_O_P_S_I_S command line might be displayed as:

           ffiilltteerr [--ffllaagg] _i_n_f_i_l_e _o_u_t_f_i_l_e

     Here, ffiilltteerr is the command name and the bracketed string --ffllaagg is a _f_l_a_g
     argument designated as optional by the option brackets.  In --mmddoocc terms,
     _i_n_f_i_l_e and _o_u_t_f_i_l_e are called _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s. The macros which formatted the
     above example:

           .Nm filter
           .Op Fl flag
           .Ar infile outfile

     In the third case, discussion of commands and command syntax includes
     both examples above, but may add more detail.  The arguments _i_n_f_i_l_e and
     _o_u_t_f_i_l_e from the example above might be referred to as _o_p_e_r_a_n_d_s or _f_i_l_e
     _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s. Some command line argument lists are quite long:

           mmaakkee  [--eeiikknnqqrrssttvv] [--DD _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e] [--dd _f_l_a_g_s] [--ff _m_a_k_e_f_i_l_e]

     Here one might talk about the command mmaakkee and qualify the argument
     _m_a_k_e_f_i_l_e, as an argument to the flag, --ff, or discuss the optional file
     operand _t_a_r_g_e_t. In the verbal context, such detail can prevent confusion,
     however the --mmddoocc package does not have a macro for an argument _t_o a
     flag.  Instead the `Ar' argument macro is used for an operand or file ar-
     gument like _t_a_r_g_e_t as well as an argument to a flag like _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e. The
     make command line was produced from:

           .Nm make
           .Op Fl eiknqrstv

     The `.Bk' and `.Ek' macros are explained in _K_e_e_p_s.

   GGeenneerraall SSyynnttaaxx
     The manual domain and general text domain macros share a similar syntax
     with a few minor deviations: `.Ar', `.Fl', `.Nm', and `.Pa' differ only
     when called without arguments; `.Fn' and `.Xr' impose an order on their
     argument lists and the `.Op' and `.Fn' macros have nesting limitations.
     All content macros are capable of recognizing and properly handling punc-
     tuation, provided each punctuation character is separated by a leading
     space.  If an request is given:

           .Li sptr, ptr),

     The result is:

           sptr, ptr),

     The punctuation is not recognized and all is output in the literal font.
     If the punctuation is separated by a leading white space:

           .Li sptr , ptr ) ,

     The result is:

           sptr, ptr),

     The punctuation is now recognized and is output in the default font dis-
     tinguishing it from the strings in literal font.

     To remove the special meaning from a punctuation character escape it with
     `\&'. Troff is limited as a macro language, and has difficulty when pre-
     sented with a string containing a member of the mathematical, logical or
     quotation set:

                 {+,-,/,*,%,<,>,<=,>=,=,==,&,`,',"}

     The problem is that troff may assume it is supposed to actually perform
     the operation or evaluation suggested by the characters.  To prevent the
     accidental evaluation of these characters, escape them with `\&'. Typical
     syntax is shown in the first content macro displayed below, `.Ad'.

   AAddddrreessss MMaaccrroo
     The address macro identifies an address construct of the form ad-
     dr1[,addr2[,addr3]].

     It is an error to call .Ad without arguments.  .Ad is callable by other

   AArrgguummeenntt MMaaccrroo
     The .Ar argument macro may be used whenever a command line argument is

     If .Ar is called without arguments `_f_i_l_e _._._.' is assumed.  The .Ar macro
     is parsed and is callable.

     The `.Cd' macro is used to demonstrate a config(8) declaration for a de-
     vice interface in a section four manual.  This macro accepts quoted argu-
     ments (double quotes only).

     The command modifier is identical to the `.Fl' (flag) command with the
     exception the `.Cm' macro does not assert a dash in front of every argu-
     ment.  Traditionally flags are marked by the preceding dash, some com-
     mands or subsets of commands do not use them.  Command modifiers may also
     be specified in conjunction with interactive commands such as editor com-
     mands.  See _F_l_a_g_s.

     The `.Er' errno macro specifies the error return value for section two
     library routines.  The second example below shows `.Er' used with the
     `.Bq' general text domain macro, as it would be used in a section two
     manual page.

           Usage: .Er ERRNOTYPE ... { . , ; : ( ) [ ]}

     The `.Fa' macro is used to refer to function arguments (parameters) out-
     side of the _S_Y_N_O_P_S_I_S section of the manual or inside the _S_Y_N_O_P_S_I_S section
     should a parameter list be too long for the `.Fn' macro and the enclosure
     macros `.Fo' and `.Fc' must be used.  `.Fa' may also be used to refer to
     structure members.

           Usage: .Fa function_argument ... { . , ; : ( ) [ ]}
                   .Fa d_namlen ) ) ,  _d___n_a_m_l_e_n)),
                   .Fa iov_len         _i_o_v___l_e_n

     It is an error to call `.Fa' without arguments.  `.Fa' is parsed and is
     callable.

   FFuunnccttiioonn DDeeccllaarraattiioonn
     The `.Fd' macro is used in the _S_Y_N_O_P_S_I_S section with section two or three
     functions.  The `.Fd' macro does not call other macros and is not
     callable by other macros.

           Usage: .Fd include_file (or defined variable)

     In the _S_Y_N_O_P_S_I_S section a `.Fd' request causes a line break if a function
     has already been presented and a break has not occurred.  This leaves a
     nice vertical space in between the previous function call and the decla-
     ration for the next function.

   FFllaaggss
     The `.Fl' macro handles command line flags.  It prepends a dash, `-', to
     the flag.  For interactive command flags, which are not prepended with a
     dash, the `.Cm' (command modifier) macro is identical, but with out the
     dash.

           Usage: .Fl argument ... { . , ; : ( ) [ ]}
                   .Fl           --
                   .Fl cfv       --ccffvv
                   .Fl cfv .     --ccffvv.

                   .Fl xyz ) ,   --xxyyzz),

     The `.Fl' macro without any arguments results in a dash representing
     stdin/stdout.  Note that giving `.Fl' a single dash, will result in two
     dashes.  The `.Fl' macro is parsed and is callable.

     The .Fn macro is modeled on ANSI C conventions.

     Usage: .Fn [type] function [[type] parameters ... { . , ; : ( ) [ ]}]
     .Fn getchar                             ggeettcchhaarr()
     .Fn strlen ) ,                          ssttrrlleenn()),

     It is an error to call `.Fn' without any arguments.  The `.Fn' macro is
     parsed and is callable, note that any call to another macro signals the
     end of the `.Fn' call (it will close-parenthesis at that point).

     For functions that have more than eight parameters (and this is rare),
     the macros `.Fo' (function open) and `.Fc' (function close) may be used
     with `.Fa' (function argument) to get around the limitation. For example:

           .Fo "int res_mkquery"
           .Fa "int op"
           .Fa "char *dname"
           .Fa "int class"
           .Fa "int type"
           .Fa "char *data"
           .Fa "int datalen"
           .Fa "struct rrec *newrr"
           .Fa "char *buf"
           .Fa "int buflen"
           .Fc

     The `.Fo' and `.Fc' macros are parsed and are callable.  In the _S_Y_N_O_P_S_I_S
     section, the function will always begin at the beginning of line.  If
     there is more than one function presented in the _S_Y_N_O_P_S_I_S section and a
     function type has not been given, a line break will occur, leaving a nice
     vertical space between the current function name and the one prior.  At
     the moment, `.Fn' does not check its word boundaries against troff line
     lengths and may split across a newline ungracefully.  This will be fixed
     in the near future.

   FFuunnccttiioonn TTyyppee
     This macro is intended for the _S_Y_N_O_P_S_I_S section.  It may be used anywhere
     else in the man page without problems, but its main purpose is to present
     the function type in kernel normal form for the _S_Y_N_O_P_S_I_S of sections two
     and three (it causes a page break allowing the function name to appear on
     the next line).

     The `.Li' macro is parsed and is callable.

   NNaammee MMaaccrroo
     The `.Nm' macro is used for the document title or subject name.  It has
     the peculiarity of remembering the first argument it was called with,
     which should always be the subject name of the page.  When called without
     arguments, `.Nm' regurgitates this initial name for the sole purpose of
     making less work for the author.  Note: a section two or three document
     function name is addressed with the `.Nm' in the _N_A_M_E section, and with
     `.Fn' in the _S_Y_N_O_P_S_I_S and remaining sections.  For interactive commands,
     such as the `while' command keyword in csh(1),  the `.Ic' macro should be
     used.  While the `.Ic' is nearly identical to `.Nm', it can not recall
     the first argument it was invoked with.

     The `.Op' macro places option brackets around the any remaining arguments

     The concept of enclosure is similar to quoting.  The object being to en-
     close one or more strings between a pair of characters like quotes or
     parentheses.  The terms quoting and enclosure are used interchangeably
     throughout this document.  Most of the one line enclosure macros end end
     in small letter `q' to give a hint of quoting, but there are a few irreg-
     ularities.  For each enclosure macro there is also a pair of open and
     close macros which end in small letters `o' and `c' respectively.  These
     can be used across one or more lines of text and while they have nesting
     limitations, the one line quote macros can be used inside of them.

           .Sq      .Sc      .So     Single Quote              `string'

     Except for the irregular macros noted below, all of the quoting macros
     are parsed and callable.  All handle punctuation properly, as long as it
     is presented one character at a time and separated by spaces.  The quot-
     ing macros examine opening and closing punctuation to determine whether
     it comes before or after the enclosing string. This makes some nesting
     possible.

     .Ec, .Eo  These macros expect the first argument to be the opening and
               closing strings respectively.

     .Ql       The quoted literal macro behaves differently for troff than
               nroff.  If formatted with nroff,  a quoted literal is always
               quoted. If formatted with troff, an item is only quoted if the
               width of the item is less than three constant width characters.
               This is to make short strings more visible where the font
               change to literal (constant width) is less noticeable.

     .Pf       The prefix macro is not callable, but it is parsed:

                     .Pf ( Fa name2
                              becomes (_n_a_m_e_2.

               The `.Ns' (no space) macro performs the analogous suffix func-
               tion.

     Examples of quoting:
           .Aq                         <>
           .Aq Ar ctype.h ) ,          <_c_t_y_p_e_._h>),
           .Bq                         []
           .Bq Em Greek , French .     [_G_r_e_e_k, _F_r_e_n_c_h].


           .Dq                         ``''
           .Dq string abc .            ``string abc''.
           .Dq '^[A-Z]'                ``'^[A-Z]'''
           .Ql man mdoc                `man mdoc'
           .Qq                         ""
           .Qq string ) ,              "string"),
           .Qq string Ns ),            "string),"
           .Sq                         `'
           .Sq string                  `string'

     For a good example of nested enclosure macros, see the `.Op' option
     macro.  It was created from the same underlying enclosure macros as those
     presented in the list above.  The `.Xo' and `.Xc' extended argument list
     macros were also built from the same underlying routines and are a good
     example of --mmddoocc macro usage at its worst.

   NNoo--OOpp oorr NNoorrmmaall TTeexxtt MMaaccrroo
     The macro .No is a hack for words in a macro command line which should
     _n_o_t be formatted and follows the conventional syntax for content macros.

   NNoo SSppaaccee MMaaccrroo
     The `.Ns' macro eliminates unwanted spaces in between macro requests.  It
     is useful for old style argument lists where there is no space between
     the flag and argument:

           .Op Fl I Ns Ar directory    produces [--II_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y]

     Note: the `.Ns' macro always invokes the `.No' macro after eliminating
     the space unless another macro name follows it.  The macro `.Ns' is
     parsed and is callable.

   SSeeccttiioonn CCrroossss RReeffeerreenncceess
     The `.Sx' macro designates a reference to a section header within the

     The following macros make a modest attempt to handle references.  At
     best, the macros make it convenient to manually drop in a subset of refer
     style references.

           .Rs     Reference Start.  Causes a line break and begins collection
                   of reference information until the reference end macro is
                   read.
           .Re     Reference End.  The reference is printed.
           .%A     Reference author name, one name per invocation.
           .%B     Book title.
           .%C     City/place.
           .%D     Date.
           .%J     Journal name.
           .%N     Issue number.
           .%O     Optional information.
           .%P     Page number.


           .%R     Report name.
           .%T     Title of article.
           .%V     Volume(s).

     The macros beginning with `%' are not callable, and are parsed only for
     the trade name macro which returns to its caller.  (And not very pre-
     dictably at the moment either.)  The purpose is to allow trade names to
     be pretty printed in troff/ditroff  output.

     The trade name macro is generally a small caps macro for all upper case

     The .Xo and .Xc macros allow one to extend an argument list on a macro
     boundary.  Argument lists cannot be extended within a macro which expects
     all of its arguments on one line such as `.Op'.

     Here is an example of `.Xo' using the space mode macro to turn spacing
     off:

           .Sm off
           .It Xo Sy I Ar operation
           .No \en Ar count No \en
           .Xc

     Another one:

           .Sm off
           .It Cm S No / Ar old_pattern Xo
           .No / Ar new_pattern
           .No / Op Cm g

     Another example of `.Xo' and using enclosure macros: Test the value of an
     variable.

           .It Xo
           .Ic .ifndef
           .Oo \&! Oc Ns Ar variable
           .Op Ar operator variable ...
           .Xc

     Produces

     All of the above examples have used the `.Xo' macro on the argument list
     of the `.It' (list-item) macro.  The extend macros are not used very of-
     ten, and when they are it is usually to extend the list-item argument
     list.  Unfortunately, this is also where the extend macros are the most
     finicky.  In the first two examples, spacing was turned off; in the
     third, spacing was desired in part of the output but not all of it.  To
     make these macros work in this situation make sure the `.Xo' and `.Xc'
     macros are placed as shown in the third example.  If the `.Xo' macro is
     not alone on the `.It' argument list, spacing will be unpredictable.  The
     `.Ns' (no space macro) must not occur as the first or last macro on a
     line in this situation.  Out of 900 manual pages (about 1500 actual
     pages) currently released with BSD only fifteen use the `.Xo' macro.

     The first three `.Sh' section header macros list below are required in
     every man page.  The remaining section headers are recommended at the
     discretion of the author writing the manual page.  The `.Sh' macro can
     take up to nine arguments.  It is parsed and but is not callable.

     .Sh NAME      The `.Sh NAME' macro is mandatory.  If not specified, the
                   headers, footers and page layout defaults will not be set
                   and things will be rather unpleasant.  The _N_A_M_E section
                   consists of at least three items.  The first is the `.Nm'
                   name macro naming the subject of the man page.  The second
                   is the Name Description macro, `.Nd', which separates the
                   subject name from the third item, which is the description.
                   The description should be the most terse and lucid possi-
                   ble, as the space available is small.

     .Sh SYNOPSIS  The _S_Y_N_O_P_S_I_S section describes the typical usage of the
                   subject of a man page.  The  macros required are either
                   `.Nm', `.Cd', `.Fn', (and possibly `.Fo', `.Fc', `.Fd',
                   `.Ft' macros).  The function name macro `.Fn' is required
                   for manual page sections 2 and 3, the command and general
                   name macro `.Nm' is required for sections 1, 5, 6, 7, 8.
                   Section 4 manuals require a `.Nm, .Fd' or a `.Cd' configu-
                   ration device usage macro.  Several other macros may be
                   necessary to produce the synopsis line as shown below:

                         ccaatt [--bbeennssttuuvv] [--] _f_i_l_e _._._.

                   The following macros were used:

                         .Nm cat
                         .Op Fl benstuv
                         .Op Fl
                         .Ar

                   NNoottee: The macros `.Op', `.Fl', and `.Ar' recognize the pipe
                   bar character `|', so a command line such as:

                         .Op Fl a | Fl b

                   will not go orbital.  Troff normally interprets a | as a
                   special operator.  See _P_R_E_D_E_F_I_N_E_D _S_T_R_I_N_G_S for a usable |
                   character in other situations.

     .Sh DESCRIPTION
                   In most cases the first text in the _D_E_S_C_R_I_P_T_I_O_N section is
                   a brief paragraph on the command, function or file, fol-
                   lowed by a lexical list of options and respective explana-
                   tions.  To create such a list, the `.Bl' begin-list, `.It'
                   list-item and `.El' end-list macros are used (see _L_i_s_t_s _a_n_d
                   _C_o_l_u_m_n_s below).

     The following `.Sh' section headers are part of the preferred manual page
     layout and must be used appropriately to maintain consistency.  They are

     listed in the order in which they would be used.

     .Sh ENVIRONMENT
               The _E_N_V_I_R_O_N_M_E_N_T section should reveal any related environment
               variables and clues to their behavior and/or usage.

     .Sh EXAMPLES
               There are several ways to create examples.  See the _E_X_A_M_P_L_E_S
               section below for details.

     .Sh FILES
               Files which are used or created by the man page subject should
               be listed via the `.Pa' macro in the _F_I_L_E_S section.

     .Sh SEE ALSO
               References to other material on the man page topic and cross
               references to other relevant man pages should be placed in the
               _S_E_E _A_L_S_O section.  Cross references are specified using the
               `.Xr' macro.  At this time refer(1) style references are not
               accommodated.

     .Sh STANDARDS
               If the command, library function or file adheres to a specific
               implementation such as IEEE Std1003.2 (``POSIX'') or ANSI C
               X3.159-1989 (``ANSI C '') this should be noted here.  If the
               command does not adhere to any standard, its history should be
               noted in the _H_I_S_T_O_R_Y section.

     .Sh HISTORY
               Any command which does not adhere to any specific standards
               should be outlined historically in this section.

     .Sh AUTHORS
               Credits, if need be, should be placed here.

     .Sh DIAGNOSTICS
               Diagnostics from a command should be placed in this section.

     .Sh ERRORS
               Specific error handling, especially from library functions (man
               page sections 2 and 3) should go here.  The `.Er' macro is used
               to specify an errno.

     .Sh BUGS  Blatant problems with the topic go here...

     User specified `.Sh' sections may be added, for example, this section was
     set with:

     .Pp     The .Pp paragraph command may be used to specify a line space
             where necessary.  The macro is not necessary after a `.Sh' or
             `.Ss' macro or before a `.Bl' macro.  (The `.Bl' macro asserts a
             vertical distance unless the -compact flag is given).

   KKeeeeppss
     The only keep that is implemented at this time is for words.  The macros
     are `.Bk' (begin-keep) and `.Ek' (end-keep).  The only option that `.Bl'
     accepts is --wwoorrddss and is useful for preventing line breaks in the middle
     of options.  In the example for the make command line arguments (see
     _W_h_a_t_'_s _i_n _a _n_a_m_e), the keep prevented nroff from placing up the flag and
     the argument on separate lines.  (Actually, the option macro used to pre-
     vent this from occurring, but was dropped when the decision (religious)
     was made to force right justified margins in troff as options in general
     look atrocious when spread across a sparse line.  More work needs to be
     done with the keep macros, a --lliinnee option needs to be added.)

     There are five types of displays, a quickie one line indented display
     `.D1', a quickie one line literal display `.Dl', and a block literal,
     block filled and block ragged which use the `.Bd' begin-display and `.Ed'
     end-display macros.

     .D1    (D-one) Display one line of indented text.  This macro is parsed,
            but it is not callable.

                  --llddgghhffssttrruu

            The above was produced by: .Dl --llddgghhffssttrruu.

     .Dl    (D-ell) Display one line of indented _l_i_t_e_r_a_l text.  The `.Dl' ex-
            ample macro has been used throughout this file.  It allows the in-
            dent (display) of one line of text.  Its default font is set to
            constant width (literal) however it is parsed and will recognized
            other macros.  It is not callable however.

                  % ls -ldg /usr/local/bin

            The above was produced by .Dl % ls -ldg /usr/local/bin.

     .Bd    Begin-display.  The `.Bd' display must be ended with the `.Ed'
            macro.  Displays may be nested within displays and lists.  `.Bd'
            has the following syntax:

                  .Bd display-type [-offset offset_value] [-compact]

            The display-type must be one of the following four types and may
            have an offset specifier for indentation: `.Bd'.

            --rraaggggeedd           Display a block of text as typed, right (and
                              left) margin edges are left ragged.
            --ffiilllleedd           Display a filled (formatted) block.  The block
                              of text is formatted (the edges are filled - not
                              left unjustified).
            --lliitteerraall          Display a literal block, useful for source code
                              or simple tabbed or spaced text.
            --ffiillee _f_i_l_e___n_a_m_e   The file name following the --ffiillee flag is read
                              and displayed.  Literal mode is asserted and
                              tabs are set at 8 constant width character in-
                              tervals, however any troff/--mmddoocc  commands in
                              file will be processed.
            --ooffffsseett _s_t_r_i_n_g    If --ooffffsseett is specified with one of the follow-
                              ing strings, the string is interpreted to indi-
                              cate the level of indentation for the forthcom-
                              ing block of text:

                              _l_e_f_t        Align block on the current left mar-
                                          gin, this is the default mode of
                                          `.Bd'.
                              _c_e_n_t_e_r      Supposedly center the block.  At
                                          this time unfortunately, the block
                                          merely gets left aligned about an
                                          imaginary center margin.
                              _i_n_d_e_n_t      Indents by one default indent value
                                          or tab.  The default indent value is
                                          also used for the `.D1' display so
                                          one is guaranteed the two types of
                                          displays will line up.  This indent
                                          is normally set to 6n or about two
                                          thirds of an inch (six constant

                                          width characters).
                              _i_n_d_e_n_t_-_t_w_o  Indents two times the default indent
                                          value.
                              _r_i_g_h_t       This _l_e_f_t aligns the block about two
                                          inches from the right side of the
                                          page.  This macro needs work and
                                          perhaps may never do the right thing
                                          by troff.

     There are several types of lists which may be initiated with the `.Bl'
     begin-list macro.  Items within the list are specified with the `.It'
     item macro and each list must end with the `.El' macro.  Lists may be
     nested within themselves and within displays.  Columns may be used inside
     of lists, but lists are unproven inside of columns.

     In addition, several list attributes may be specified such as the width
     of a tag, the list offset, and compactness (blank lines between items al-
     lowed or disallowed).  Most of this document has been formatted with a
     tag style list (--ttaagg). For a change of pace, the list-type used to pre-
     sent the list-types is an over-hanging list (--oohhaanngg). This type of list
     is quite popular with TeX users, but might look a bit funny after having
     read many pages of tagged lists.  The following list types are accepted
     by `.Bl':

     --bbuulllleett
     --iitteemm
     --eennuumm
     These three are the simplest types of lists.  Once the `.Bl' macro has
     been given, items in the list are merely indicated by a line consisting
     solely of the `.It' macro.  For example, the source text for a simple
     enumerated list would look like:

                 .Bl -enum -compact
                 .It
                 Item one goes here.
                 .It
                 And item two here.
                 .It
                 Lastly item three goes here.
                 .El

     The results:

               1.   Item one goes here.
               2.   And item two here.
               3.   Lastly item three goes here.

     A simple bullet list construction:

                 .Bl -bullet -compact
                 .It
                 Bullet one goes here.
                 .It
                 Bullet two here.
                 .El

     Produces:
               ++oo   Bullet one goes here.
               ++oo   Bullet two here.



     --ttaagg
     --ddiiaagg
     --hhaanngg
     --oohhaanngg
     --iinnsseett
     These list-types collect arguments specified with the `.It' macro and
     create a label which may be _i_n_s_e_t into the forth coming text, _h_a_n_g_e_d from
     the forth coming text, _o_v_e_r_h_a_n_g_e_d from above and not indented or _t_a_g_g_e_d.
     This list was constructed with the `--oohhaanngg' list-type.  The `.It' macro
     is parsed only for the inset, hang and tag list-types and is not
     callable.  Here is an example of inset labels:

           _T_a_g The tagged list (also called a tagged paragraph) is the most
           common type of list used in the Berkeley manuals.

           _D_i_a_g Diag lists create section four diagnostic lists and are simi-
           lar to inset lists except callable macros are ignored.

           _H_a_n_g Hanged labels are a matter of taste.

           _O_h_a_n_g Over hanging labels are nice when space is constrained.

           _I_n_s_e_t Inset labels are useful for controlling blocks of paragraphs
           and are valuable for converting --mmddoocc manuals to other formats.

     Here is the source text which produced the above example:

           .Bl -inset -offset indent
           .It Em Tag
           The tagged list (also called a tagged paragraph) is the
           most common type of list used in the Berkeley manuals.
           .It Em Diag
           Diag lists create section four diagnostic lists
           and are similar to inset lists except callable
           macros are ignored.
           .It Em Hang
           Hanged labels are a matter of taste.
           .It Em Ohang
           Over hanging labels are nice when space is constrained.
           .It Em Inset
           Inset labels are useful for controlling blocks of
           paragraphs and are valuable for converting
           .Nm -mdoc
           manuals to other formats.
           .El

     Here is a hanged list with just one item:

           _H_a_n_g_e_d labels appear similar to tagged lists when the label is
                   smaller than the label width.

           _L_o_n_g_e_r _h_a_n_g_e_d _l_i_s_t _l_a_b_e_l_s blend in to the paragraph unlike tagged
                   paragraph labels.

     And the unformatted text which created it:

           .Bl -hang -offset indent
           .It Em Hanged
           labels appear similar to tagged lists when the
           label is smaller than the label width.
           .It Em Longer hanged list labels
           blend in to the paragraph unlike
           tagged paragraph labels.
           .El


     The tagged list which follows uses an optional width specifier to control
     the width of the tag.

           SL      sleep time of the process (seconds blocked)
           PAGEIN  number of disk I/O's resulting from references by the pro-
                   cess to pages not loaded in core.
           UID     numerical user-id of process owner
           PPID    numerical id of parent of process process priority (non-
                   positive when in non-interruptible wait)

     The raw text:

           .Bl -tag -width "PAGEIN" -compact -offset indent
           .It SL
           sleep time of the process (seconds blocked)
           .It PAGEIN
           number of disk
           .Tn I/O Ns 's
           resulting from references
           by the process to pages not loaded in core.
           .It UID
           numerical user-id of process owner
           .It PPID
           numerical id of parent of process process priority
           (non-positive when in non-interruptible wait)
           .El

     Acceptable width specifiers:

           --wwiiddtthh _F_l     sets the width to the default width for a flag.  All
                         callable macros have a default width value.  The
                         `.Fl', value is presently set to ten constant width
                         characters or about five sixth of an inch.

           --wwiiddtthh _2_4_n    sets the width to 24 constant width characters or
                         about two inches.  The `n' is absolutely necessary
                         for the scaling to work correctly.

           --wwiiddtthh _E_N_A_M_E_T_O_O_L_O_N_G
                         sets width to the constant width length of the string
                         given.

           --wwiiddtthh _"_i_n_t _m_k_f_i_f_o_"
                         again, the width is set to the constant width of the
                         string given.

     If a width is not specified for the tag list type, the first time `.It'
     is invoked, an attempt is made to determine an appropriate width.  If the
     first argument to `.It' is a callable macro, the default width for that
     macro will be used as if the macro name had been supplied as the width.
     However, if another item in the list is given with a different callable
     macro name, a new and nested list is assumed.

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
     The debugging facilities for --mmddoocc are limited, but can help detect sub-
     tle errors such as the collision of an argument name with an internal
     register or macro name.  (A what?)  A register is an arithmetic storage
     class for troff with a one or two character name.  All registers internal
     to --mmddoocc for troff and ditroff are two characters and of the form <up-
     per_case><lower_case> such as `Ar', <lower_case><upper_case> as `aR' or
     <upper or lower letter><digit> as `C1'. And adding to the muddle, troff
     has its own internal registers all of which are either two lower case
     characters or a dot plus a letter or meta-character character.  In one of
     the introduction examples, it was shown how to prevent the interpretation
     of a macro name with the escape sequence `\&'. This is sufficient for the
     internal register names also.

     If a non-escaped register name is given in the argument list of a request
     unpredictable behavior will occur.  In general, any time huge portions of
     text do not appear where expected in the output, or small strings such as
     list tags disappear, chances are there is a misunderstanding about an ar-
     gument type in the argument list.  Your mother never intended for you to
     remember this evil stuff - so here is a way to find out whether or not
     your arguments are valid: The `.Db' (debug) macro displays the interpre-
     tation of the argument list for most macros.  Macros such as the `.Pp'
     (paragraph) macro do not contain debugging information.  All of the
     callable macros do, and it is strongly advised whenever in doubt, turn on
     the `.Db' macro.

           Usage: .Db [on | off]

     An example of a portion of text with the debug macro placed above and be-
     low an artificially created problem (a flag argument `aC' which should be
     `\&aC' in order to work):

           .Db on
           .Op Fl aC Ar file )
           .Db off

     The resulting output:

           DEBUGGING ON
           DEBUG(argv) MACRO: `.Op'  Line #: 2
                   Argc: 1  Argv: `Fl'  Length: 2
                   Space: `'  Class: Executable
                   Argc: 2  Argv: `aC'  Length: 2
                   Space: `'  Class: Executable
                   Argc: 3  Argv: `Ar'  Length: 2
                   Space: `'  Class: Executable
                   Argc: 4  Argv: `file'  Length: 4
                   Space: ` '  Class: String
                   Argc: 5  Argv: `)'  Length: 1
                   Space: ` '  Class: Closing Punctuation or suffix
                   MACRO REQUEST: .Op Fl aC Ar file )
           DEBUGGING OFF

     The first line of information tells the name of the calling macro, here
     `.Op', and the line number it appears on.  If one or more files are in-
     volved (especially if text from another file is included) the line number
     may be bogus.  If there is only one file, it should be accurate.  The
     second line gives the argument count, the argument (`Fl') and its length.
     If the length of an argument is two characters, the argument is tested to
     see if it is executable (unfortunately, any register which contains a
     non-zero value appears executable).  The third line gives the space al-
     lotted for a class, and the class type.  The problem here is the argument
     aC should not be executable.  The four types of classes are string, exe-
     cutable, closing punctuation and opening punctuation.  The last line
     shows the entire argument list as it was read.  In this next example, the
     offending `aC' is escaped:

           .Db on
           .Em An escaped \&aC

     The argument `\&aC' shows up with the same length of 2 as the `\&' se-
     quence produces a zero width, but a register named `\&aC' was not found
     and the type classified as string.

     Other diagnostics consist of usage statements and are self explanatory.

     The --mmddoocc package does not need compatibility mode with groff.

     The package inhibits page breaks, and the headers and footers which nor-
     mally occur at those breaks with nroff,  to make the manual more effi-
     cient for viewing on-line.  At the moment, groff with --TT_a_s_c_i_i does eject
     the imaginary remainder of the page at end of file.  The inhibiting of
     the page breaks makes nroff'd  files unsuitable for hardcopy.  There is a
     register named `cR' which can be set to zero in the site dependent style
     file _/_u_s_r_/_s_r_c_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_t_m_a_c_/_d_o_c_-_n_r_o_f_f to restore the old style behavior.

     Undesirable hyphenation on the dash of a flag argument is not yet re-
     solved, and causes occasional mishaps in the _D_E_S_C_R_I_P_T_I_O_N section.  (line
     break on the hyphen).

     Predefined strings are not declared in documentation.


     Section 3f has not been added to the header routines.

     `.Nm' font should be changed in _N_A_M_E section.

     `.Fn' needs to have a check to prevent splitting up if the line length is
     too short.  Occasionally it separates the last parenthesis, and sometimes
     looks ridiculous if a line is in fill mode.

     The method used to prevent header and footer page breaks (other than the
     initial header and footer) when using nroff occasionally places an un-
     sightly partially filled line (blank) at the would be bottom of the page.

     The list and display macros to not do any keeps and certainly should be
     able to.
