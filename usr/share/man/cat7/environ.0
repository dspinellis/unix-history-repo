     An array of strings called the _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t is made available by execve(2)
     when a process begins.  By convention these strings have the form
     ``_n_a_m_e=_v_a_l_u_e''.  The following names are used by various commands:

     EXINIT    A startup list of commands read by ex(1), edit(1), and vi(1).

     HOME      A user's login directory, set by login(1) from the password
	       file passwd(5).

     PATH      The sequence of directories, separated by colons, searched by
	       csh(1), sh(1), system(3), execvp(3), etc, when looking for an
	       executable file.  PATH is set to ``:/usr/ucb:/bin:/usr/bin''
	       initially by login(1).

     PRINTER   The name of the default printer to be used by lpr(1), lpq(1),
	       and lprm(1).

     SHELL     The full pathname of the user's login shell.

     TERM      The kind of terminal for which output is to be prepared.  This
	       information is used by commands, such as nroff(1) or plot(1)
	       which may exploit special terminal capabilities.  See
	       /_u_s_r/_s_h_a_r_e/_m_i_s_c/_t_e_r_m_c_a_p (tmercap(5)) for a list of terminal
	       types.

     TERMCAP   The string describing the terminal in TERM, or, if it begins
	       with a '/', the name of the termcap file.  See TERMPATH below,
	       termcap(5), and termcap.

     TERMPATH
	       A sequence of pathnames of termcap files, separated by colons
	       or spaces, which are searched for terminal descriptions in the
	       order listed.  Having no TERMPATH is equivalent to a TERMPATH
	       of ``$_H_O_M_E/._t_e_r_m_c_a_p:/_e_t_c/_t_e_r_m_c_a_p''.  TERMPATH is ignored if
	       TERMCAP contains a full pathname.

     USER      The login name of the user.

     Further names may be placed in the environment by the export command and
     _n_a_m_e=_v_a_l_u_e arguments in sh(1), or by the setenv command if you use
     csh(1).  It is unwise to change certain sh(1) variables that are fre-
     quently exported by ._p_r_o_f_i_l_e files, such as MAIL, PS1, PS2, and IFS, un-
     less you know what you are doing.

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
     csh(1), ex(1), login(1), sh(1), execve(2), execle(3), system(3),
     termcap(3), termcap(5)
