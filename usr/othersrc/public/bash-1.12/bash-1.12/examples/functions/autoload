# An almost ksh-compatible `autoload'.  A function declared as `autoload' will
# be read in from a file the same name as the function found by searching the
# $FPATH (which works the same as $PATH), then that definition will be run.
#
# To do this without source support, we define a dummy function that, when
# executed, will load the file (thereby re-defining the function), then 
# execute that newly-redefined function with the original arguments.
#
# It's not identical to ksh because ksh apparently does lazy evaluation
# and looks for the file to load from only when the function is referenced.
# This one requires that the file exist when the function is declared as
# `autoload'.

# by the file and the file itself *must* be named identically.
