.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Slattach
is used to assign a tty line to a network interface,
and to define the network source and destination addresses.
The following operands are supported by
.Nm slattach :
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Ar \-a
Autoenable the VJ header compression option, if the other end of the link
is capable of VJ header compression then it will be used otherwise normal
headers will be used.
.It Ar \-c
Enables the VJ header compression option.  Note that both ends of the link
must be able to use VJ header compression for this to work.
.It Ar \-h
Turn on cts/rts style flow control on the slip port, by default no flow
control is done.
.It Ar \-n
Throw away ICMP packets.  The slip interface will ignore ICMP packets
to prevent slow lines being saturated by ICMP responses.
.It Ar \-s baudrate
Specifies the speed of the connection. If not specified, the
default of 9600 is used.
.It Ar ttyname
Specifies the name of the tty device.
.Ar Ttyname
should be a string of the form
.Ql ttyXX ,
or
.Ql /dev/ttyXX .
.El
.Pp
Only the super-user may attach a network interface.
.Pp
To detach the interface, use
.Dq Li ifconfig interface-name down
after killing off the
.Nm slattach
process.
.Ar Interface-name
is the name that is shown by
.Xr netstat 1
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
slattach ttyh8
slattach \-s 4800 /dev/tty01
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Messages indicating the specified interface does not exit, the
requested address is unknown, the user is not privileged and
tried to alter an interface's configuration.

.Xr netintro 4 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8 ,

.Nm
command appeared in
