.Sh NAME
.Nm kvm_geterr
.Nd get error message on kvm descriptor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <kvm.h>
.br
.Ft char *
.Fn kvm_geterr "kvm_t *kd"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This function returns a string describing the most recent error condition
on the descriptor
.Fa kd .
The results are undefined if the most recent
.Xr kvm 3
library call did not produce an error.
The string returned is stored in memory owned by 
.Xr kvm 3
so the message should be copied out and saved elsewhere if necessary.
.Sh BUGS
This routine cannot be used to access error conditions due to a failed
.Fn kvm_openfiles
call, since failure is indicated by returning a
.Dv NULL
descriptor.
Therefore, errors on open are output to the special error buffer
passed to 
.Fn kvm_openfiles .
This option is not available to
.Fn kvm_open .
