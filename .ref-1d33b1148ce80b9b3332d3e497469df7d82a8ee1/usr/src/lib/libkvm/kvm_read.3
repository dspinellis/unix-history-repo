.Sh NAME
.Nm kvm_read ,
.Nm kvm_write
.Nd read or write kernel virtual memory
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <kvm.h>
.Ft ssize_t
.Fn kvm_read "kvm_t *kd" "u_long addr" "void *buf" "size_t nbytes"
.Ft ssize_t
.Fn kvm_write "kvm_t *kd" "u_long addr" "const void *buf" "size_t nbytes"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn kvm_read
and
.Fn kvm_write
functions are used to read and write kernel virtual memory (or a crash
dump file). See
.Fn kvm_open 3
or
.Fn kvm_openfiles 3
for information regarding opening kernel virtual memory and crash dumps.
.Pp
The
.Fn kvm_read
function transfers
.Fa nbytes 
bytes of data from
the kernel space address
.Fa addr
to
.Fa buf .
Conversely, 
.Fn kvm_write
transfers data from
.Fa buf
to
.Fa addr .
Unlike their SunOS counterparts, these functions cannot be used to 
read or write process address spaces.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon success, the number of bytes actually transferred is returned.
Otherwise, -1 is returned.
