.TH RESET 1 "18 July 1983"
.UC 4
.SH NAME
reset \- reset the teletype bits to a sensible state
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B reset
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Reset
sets the terminal to cooked mode, turns off cbreak and raw modes,
turns on nl, and restores special characters that are undefined
to their default values.
.PP
This is most useful after a program dies leaving a terminal in a funny
state; you have to type ``<LF>reset<LF>'' to get it to work then to the
shell, as <CR> often doesn't work; often none of this will echo.
.PP
It is a good idea to follow
.I reset
with
.IR tset (1)
.SH SEE ALSO
stty(1), tset(1)
.SH BUGS
Doesn't set tabs properly; it can't intuit personal choices for interrupt
and line kill characters, so it leaves these set to the local system
standards.
