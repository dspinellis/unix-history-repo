@(#)README	4.2	(Berkeley)	82/11/06"

The writing tools package contains 3 command files,
	style, diction, and suggest.
``style'' reads a document and analyzes the surface
	characteristics of the writing style of the document.
``diction'' locates all sentences in a document containing
	commonly misused or wordy phrases.
``suggest'' is an interactive thesaures for the phrases found by diction.
	suggest was originally named ``explain''.

The manual pages are in files style.1 and diction.1 - see the enclosed
	documentation for more details.

``style'' is a runcom that runs 4 programs, style1, style2, style3, and deroff.

To make style:
	set LIB in Makefile to the directory where the object files
		are to be stored. (probably /usr/lib/style)
	set BIN in Makefile to the directory for the shell programs
		(usually /usr/bin)
	in the file ``style'' set L to the same directory as LIB above.
		the same is needed in ``topic'', which is installed
		when you make style
	if you wish to collect data on the documents run, also define SCATCH
		otherwise delete the definition of SCATCH in Makefile
		if you are collecting data, the file must exist and be writeable
		by everyone
	then run ``make style''
		this will compile and install all of the programs in both
		LIB and BIN

``diction'' is a runcom that runs 2 programs, dprog and deroff.

To make dprog:
	set DICT in Makefile to the full path name of diction's data
		file ``dict.d''
	the file ``diction'' also needs L set to the same directory as LIB
	the program ``dprog'' will get put in the same place as
		the object files for style (LIB).
	if you wish to collect data on the documents run, also define CATCH
		otherwise delete the definition of CATCH in Makefile
		the collection file must exist and be writeable by everyone
	then run ``make diction''

The file ``suggest'' needs D set to the full path name of the file
	suggest.d

Both ``style'' and ``diction'' expect the document to contain formatting
	commands.  A new version of deroff is included that knows about
	the standard UNIX formatting macro packages.
	the source for getopt.c is included just in case you don't have it.
	if the loader complains about not finding getopt, compile & load
		it with deroff.c
	typing
		make deroff
	will compile and install it in /usr/bin

The default flag passed to deroff (either -ms or -mm) in both
	style and diction should be set to the proper one for your installation.

These programs will not compile under UNIX version 6 or PWB 1.2
	because of size limitations on these systems.
