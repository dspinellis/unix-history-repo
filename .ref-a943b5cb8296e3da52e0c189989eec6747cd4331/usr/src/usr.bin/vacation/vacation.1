.SH NAME
vacation \- return ``I am on vacation'' indication
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vacation
.B \-I
.br
.B vacation
user
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Vacation
returns a message to the sender of a message
telling that you are on vacation.
The intended use is in a
.I \&.forward
file.
For example,
your
.I \&.forward
file might have:
.PP
.ti +5
\eeric, "|vacation eric"
.PP
which would send messages to you
(assuming your login name was eric)
and send a message back to the sender.
.PP
.I Vacation
expects a file
.I \&.vacation.msg
in your home directory containing a message to be sent back
to each sender.
It should be an entire message
(including headers).
For example, it might say:
.PP
.in +5
.nf
From: eric@ucbmonet.Berkeley.EDU (Eric Allman)
Subject: I am on vacation
Delivered-By-The-Graces-Of: the Vacation program

I am on vacation until July 22.  If you have something urgent,
please contact Joe Kalash <kalash@ucbingres.Berkeley.EDU>.

.in -5
.PP
This message will only be sent once a week to each unique
sender.
The people who have sent you messages are kept in the files
.I \&.vacation.pag
and
.I \&.vacation.dir
in your home directory.
The
.B \-I
option initializes these files,
and should be executed before you modify your
.I \&.forward
file.
.PP
If the
.B \-I
flag is not specified,
.I vacation
reads the first line from the standard input
for a \s-1UNIX\s0-style
``From'' line
to determine the sender.
If this is not present,
a nasty diagnostic is produced.
.IR Sendmail (8)
includes the ``From'' line automatically.
.PP
No message is sent
if the initial
``From'' line includes the string
``-REQUEST@''
or if a ``Precedence: bulk'' or ``Precedence: junk'' line
is included in the header.
