.TH END 3 
.SH NAME
end, etext, edata \- last locations in program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B extern end;
.br
.B extern etext;
.br
.B extern edata;
.SH DESCRIPTION
These names refer neither to routines
nor to locations with interesting contents.
The address of
.I etext
is the first address above the program text,
.I edata
above the initialized data region, and
.I end
above the uninitialized data region.
.PP
When execution begins, the program break
coincides with
.I end,
but many functions reset the program break, among them
the routines of
.IR brk (2),
.IR malloc (3), 
standard input/output
.RI ( stdio (3)),
the profile
.RB ( \-p )
option of 
.IR cc (1),
etc.
The current value of the program break
is reliably returned by `sbrk(0)',
see
.IR brk (2).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
brk(2), malloc(3)
