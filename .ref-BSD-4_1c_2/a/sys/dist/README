The scripts needed to build a boot tape for 4.1b and beyond
live here.  Before trying anything look at the scripts 

	buildmini
	get
	maketape

To construct a tape suitable for bootstrapping a system
first find a spare file system for a ``mini root'' and
patch the buildmini shell script to reflect its location.
Second, decide where your ``distribution'' source is located
and patch the get and maketape scripts.  Then do the following:
	% buildmini
	% maketape
Finally, build the second tape which is a tar of /usr/src with
	% cd /usr/src; tar c .
Be sure and check /usr/src will fit on one tape.  The current
distribution is about 40 megabytes and easily fits on one tape
at 1600bpi with a blocking factor of 20.
