This update to the fourth distribution of November 1980 provides
support for the VAX 11/750 and for the full interconnect architecture of
the VAX 11/780.  Robert Elz of the University of Melbourne
contributed greatly to this distribution especially in the boot-time
system configuration code; Bill Shannon
of DEC supplied us with the implementation of DEC standard bad block handing.
The research group at Bell Laboratories and DEC Merrimack provided us with
access to 11/750's in order to debug its support.
.LP
Other individuals too numerous to mention provided us with bug reports,
fixes and other enhancements which are reflected in the system.
We are ever grateful to the UNIX user community for encouragement and
support.
.LP
The financial support of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
in support of this work is gratefully acknowledged.

This manual reflects the Berkeley system mid-October, 1980.
A large amount of tuning has been done in the system since the last release;
we hope this provides as noticeable an improvement for you as it did for us.
This release finds the system in transition; a number of facilities
have been added in experimental versions (job control, resource limits)
and the implementation of others is imminent (shared-segments, higher
performance from the file system, etc.).
Applications which use facilities that are in transition should be aware
that some of the system calls and library routines will change
in the near future.  We have tried to be conscientious and make it
very clear where this is likely.
.LP
A new group has been formed
at Berkeley, to assume responsibility for the future
development and support of a version of UNIX on the VAX.
The group has received funding from the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
to supply a standard version of the system to DARPA contractors.
The same version of the system will be made available to other licensees
of UNIX on the VAX for a duplication charge.
We gratefully acknowledge
the support of this contract.
.LP
We wish to acknowledge the contribution of a number of individuals to
the the system.
.LP
We would especially like to thank
Jim Kulp of IIASA,
Laxenburg Austria and his colleagues,
who first put job control facilities into UNIX;
Eric Allman, Robert Henry, Peter Kessler and Kirk McKusick, who
contributed major new pieces of software;
Mark Horton, who contributed to the improvement of facilities and
substantially improved the quality of our bit-mapped fonts,
our hardware support staff:
Bob Kridle,
Anita Hirsch,
Len Edmondson
and
Fred Archibald,
who helped us to debug a number of new peripherals;
Ken Arnold who did much of the leg-work in getting this version of the
manual prepared, and did the final editing of sections 2-6,
some special individuals within Bell Laboratories:
Greg Chesson,
Stuart Feldman,
Dick Haight,
Howard Katseff,
Brian Kernighan,
Tom London,
John Reiser,
Dennis Ritchie,
Ken Thompson,
and
Peter Weinberger
who helped out by answering questions;
our excellent local DEC field service people,
Kevin Althaus and Frank Chargois
who kept our machine running virtually all the time, and fixed it quickly
when things broke;
and,
Mike Accetta of Carnegie-Mellon University,
Robert Elz of the University of Melbourne,
George Goble of Purdue University,
and
David Kashtan of the Stanford Research Institute
for their technical advice and support.
.bp
Special thanks to Bill Munson of DEC who helped by augmenting
our computing facility
and to Eric Allman for carefully proofreading the
``last'' draft of the manual and finding the bugs which we knew were
there but couldn't see.
.LP
We dedicate this to the memory of David Sakrison,
late chairman of our department,
who gave his support to the establishment of our VAX
computing facility, and to our department as a whole.

This manual reflects the state of the Berkeley system, December 1979.
We would like to thank all the people at Berkeley who have contributed to
the system, and particularly thank
Prof. Richard Fateman for creating and administrating a hospitable environment,
Mark Horton who helped prepare this manual, and
Eric Allman, Bob Kridle, Juan Porcar
and Richard Tuck for their contributions to the kernel.
.LP
The cooperation of Bell Laboratories in providing us with an early version of
\s-2UNIX\s0/32V is greatly appreciated.  We would especially like to thank
Dr. Charles Roberts of Bell Laboratories for helping us obtain this release,
and acknowledge
T. B. London,
J. F. Reiser,
K. Thompson,
D. M. Ritchie,
G. Chesson and
H. P. Katseff
for their advice and support.

Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie remain the fathers
and preceptors of the
\s-2UNIX\s0
time-sharing system.
Many of the improvements here described bear their mark.

the further flowering of
\s-2UNIX\s0,
we wish especially to
acknowledge the contributions of
A. V. Aho,
