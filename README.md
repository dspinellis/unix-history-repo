# Unix History Repository
The history and evolution of the Unix operating system is made available
as a revision management repository, covering the period from its
inception in 1970 as a 2500 line kernel and 26 commands,
to 2017 as a widely-used 27 million line system. The 1.1GB repository
contains about half a million commits and more than two thousand merges.
The repository employs Git system for its storage and is hosted on GitHub.
It has been created by synthesizing with custom software 24 snapshots of
systems developed at Bell Labs, the University of California at Berkeley,
and the 386BSD team, two legacy repositories, and the modern repository
of the open source FreeBSD system.
In total, about one thousand individual contributors are identified,
the early ones through primary research.
The data set can be used for empirical research in software engineering,
information systems, and software archaeology.

You can read more details about the contents, creation, and uses of this
repository through [this link](http://www.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/pubs/jrnl/2016-EMPSE-unix-history/html/unix-history.html).

Two repositories are associated with the project:
* [unix-history-repo](https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo) is
  a repository representing a
  reconstructed version of the Unix history, based on the currently
  available data. This repository will be often automatically regenerated from
  scratch, so this is not a place to make contributions.
  To ensure replicability its users are encouraged to fork it or archive it.
* [unix-history-make](https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-make) is
  a repository containing code and metadata used to build the above repository.
  Contributions to this repository are welcomed.

## Project status
The project has achieved its major goal with the establishment of a continuous timeline from 1970 until today. The repository contains:

* snapshots of PDP-7, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, and V7 Research Edition,
* Unix/32V,
* all available BSD releases,
* the CSRG SCCS history,
* two releases of 386BSD,
* the 386BSD patchkit,
* the FreeBSD 1.0 to 1.1.5 CVS history,
* an import of the FreeBSD repository starting from its initial imports that led to FreeBSD 2.0, and
* the current FreeBSD repository.

The files appear to be added in the repository in chronological order according to their modification time, and large parts of the source code have been attributed to their actual authors.  Commands like `git blame` and `git log` produce the expected results.

The repository contains a number of two-way merges.

* 3 BSD is merged from Unix/32V and Research Edition 6
* Various BSD releases are merged from the development branch and a time point of BSD-SCCS
* FreeBSD 1.0 is merged from Net/2 BSD and 386BSD-0.1-patchkit
* FreeBSD 2.0 is merged from BSD 4.4/Lite1 and FreeBSD 1.1.5

Blame is apportioned appropriately.

## Cool things you can do

The easiest thing you can do is to
watch the repository's [Gource Visualization](https://youtu.be/S7JB0mhrGCQ).

If you have a broadband network connection and about 1.5GB of free disk space,
you can download the repository and run Git commands that go back decades.
Run
```sh
git clone https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo
git checkout BSD-Release
```
to get a local copy of the Unix history repository.
### View log across releases
Running
```sh
git log --reverse --date-order

## How you can help
You can help if you were there at the time, or if you can locate a
source that contains information that is currently missing.
* If your current GitHub account is not linked to your past contributions,
  (you can search them through
  [this page](http://www.spinellis.gr/cgi-bin/namegrep.pl)),
  associate your past email with your current account through your
  [GitHub account settings](https://github.com/settings/emails).
  (Contact me for instructions on how to add email addresses to which you no
  longer have access.)
* Look for errors and omissions in the
  [files that map file paths to authors](https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-make/blob/master/src/author-path).
* Look for parts of the system that have not yet been attributed
  [in these files](https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-make/blob/master/src/unmatched)
  and propose suitable attributions.
  Keep in mind that attributions for parts that were developed in one place
  and modified elsewhere (e.g. developed at Bell Labs and modified at Berkeley)
  should be for the person who did the modification, not the original author.
* Look for authors whose identifier starts with ```x-``` in the
  author id to name map files for
  [Bell Labs](https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-make/blob/master/src/bell.au),
  and
  [Berkeley](https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-make/blob/master/src/berkeley.au),
  and provide or confirm their actual login identifier.
  (The one used is a guess.)
* Contribute a path regular expression to contributor map file
  (see [v7.map](https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-make/blob/master/src/author-path/v7)) for
  [4.2BSD](http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/4BSD/Distributions/4.2BSD/),
  [4.3BSD](http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/4BSD/Distributions/4.3BSD/),
  [4.3BSD-Reno](http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/4BSD/Distributions/4.3BSD-Reno/),
  [4.3BSD-Tahoe](http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/4BSD/Distributions/4.3BSD-Tahoe/),
  [4.3BSD-Alpha](http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/4BSD/Distributions/4.3BSD-Alpha/), and
  [Net2](http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/4BSD/Distributions/Net2/).
* Import further branches, such as 2BSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and _Plan 9 from Bell Labs_.

## Re-creating the historical repository from scratch
The -make repository is provided to share and document the creation process, rather than as a bullet-proof way to get consistent and repeatable results.  For instance, importing the snapshots on a system that is case-insensitive (NTFS, HFS Plus with default settings) will result in a few files getting lost.

### Prerequisites
* Git
* Perl
* The Perl modules `VCS::SCCS` and `Git::FastExport`
(Install with `sudo cpanm VCS::SCCS Git::FastExport`.)
* If compiling patch under GNU/Linux and library `libbsd`
(e.g. the `libbsd-dev` package).
* Sudo (and authorization to use it to mount ISO images)

### Repository creation
The -repo repository can be created with the following commands.
```sh
make
./import.sh
```

## Adding a single source
If you want to add a new source without running the full import process,
you can do the following.

* Prepare the source's maps and data
* `cd` to the repo directory
* Checkout the repo at the point where the new source will branch out
* Run a Perl command such as the following.

```
perl ../import-dir.pl [-v] -m Research-V7 -c ../author-path/Bell-32V \
-n ../bell.au -r Research-V7 -i ../ignore/Bell-32V \
$ARCHIVE/32v Bell 32V -0500 | gfi
```
