     NN..BB..:: For most normal file system maintenance, the function
     of _n_c_h_e_c_k is subsumed by _f_s_c_k(8).

     _N_c_h_e_c_k with no options generates a pathname vs. i-number
     list of all files on every specified filesystem.  Names of
     directory files are followed by `/..'.  The --ii option reduces
     the report to only those files whose i-numbers follow.  The
     --aa option allows printing of the names `..' and `....', which
     are ordinarily suppressed.  The --ss option reduces the report
     to special files and files with set-user-ID mode; it is
     intended to discover concealed violations of security pol-
     icy.

     The report is in no useful order, and probably should be
     sorted.

     When the filesystem structure is improper, `??' denotes the
     `parent' of a parentless file and a pathname beginning with
     `...' denotes a loop.
