     _M_A_K_E_D_E_V is a shell script normally used to install special
     files.  It resides in the /_d_e_v directory, as this is the
     normal location of special files.	Arguments to _M_A_K_E_D_E_V are
     usually of the form _d_e_v_i_c_e-_n_a_m_e?  where _d_e_v_i_c_e-_n_a_m_e is one
     of the supported devices listed in section 4 of the manual
     and ``?'' is a logical unit number (0-9).	A few special
     arguments create assorted collections of devices and are
     listed below.

     ssttdd  Create the _s_t_a_n_d_a_r_d devices for the system; e.g.
	  /dev/console, /dev/tty.  The VAX-11/780 console floppy
	  device, /dev/floppy, and VAX-11/750 and VAX-11/730 con-
	  sole cassette device(s), /dev/tu?, are also created
	  with this entry.

     llooccaall
	  Create those devices specific to the local site.  This
	  request causes the shell file /_d_e_v/_M_A_K_E_D_E_V._l_o_c_a_l to be
	  executed.  Site specific commands, such as those used
	  to setup dialup lines as ``ttyd?'' should be included
	  in this file.

     Since all devices are created using _m_k_n_o_d(8), this shell
     script is useful only to the super-user.

     Either self-explanatory, or generated by one of the programs
     called from the script.  Use ``sh -x MAKEDEV'' in case of
     trouble.
