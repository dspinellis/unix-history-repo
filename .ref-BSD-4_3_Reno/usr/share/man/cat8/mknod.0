     _M_k_n_o_d makes a special file.  The first argument is the _n_a_m_e
     of the entry.  The second is bb if the special file is
     block-type (disks, tape) or cc if it is character-type (other
     devices).	The last two arguments are numbers specifying the
     _m_a_j_o_r device type and the _m_i_n_o_r device (e.g. unit, drive, or
     line number).

     The assignment of major device numbers is specific to each
     system.  They have to be dug out of the system source file
     _c_o_n_f._c.
