     format - how to format disk packs

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     There are two ways to format disk packs.  The simplest is to
     use the _f_o_r_m_a_t program.  The alternative is to use the DEC
     standard formatting software which operates under the DEC
     diagnostic supervisor. This manual page describes the opera-
     tion of _f_o_r_m_a_t, then concludes with some remarks about using
     the DEC formatter.

     _F_o_r_m_a_t is a standalone program used to format and check
     disks prior to constructing file systems.	In addition to
     the formatting operation, _f_o_r_m_a_t records any bad sectors
     encountered according to DEC standard 144. Formatting is
     performed one track at a time by writing the appropriate
     headers and a test pattern and then checking the sector by
     reading and verifying the pattern, using the controller's
     ECC for error detection.  A sector is marked bad if an unre-
     coverable media error is detected, or if a correctable ECC
     error too many bits in length is detected (such errors are
     indicated as ``ECC'' in the summary printed upon completing
     the format operation).  After the entire disk has been for-
     matted and checked, the total number of errors are reported,
     any bad sectors and skip sectors are marked, and a bad sec-
     tor forwarding table is written to the disk in the first
     five even numbered sectors of the last track.  It is also
     possible to reformat sections of the disk in units of
     tracks.  _F_o_r_m_a_t may be used on any UNIBUS or MASSBUS drive
     supported by the _u_p and _h_p device drivers which uses 4-byte
     headers (everything except RP's).

     The test pattern used during the media check may be selected
     from one of: 0xf00f (RH750 worst case), 0xec6d (media worst
     case), and 0xa5a5 (alternating 1's and 0's).  Normally the
     media worst case pattern is used.

     _F_o_r_m_a_t also has an option to perform an extended "severe
     burn-in," which makes a number of passes using different
     patterns.	The number of passes can be selected at run time,
     up to a maximum of 48, with provision for additional passes
     or termination after the preselected number of passes.  This
     test runs for many hours, depending on the disk and proces-
     sor.

     Each time _f_o_r_m_a_t is run to format an entire disk, a com-
     pletely new bad sector table is generated based on errors
     encountered while formatting.  The device driver, however,
     will always attempt to read any existing bad sector table
     when the device is first opened.  Thus, if a disk pack has
     never previously been formatted, or has been formatted with
     different sectoring, five error messages will be printed

     when the driver attempts to read the bad sector table; these
     diagnostics should be ignored.

     Formatting a 400 megabyte disk on a MASSBUS disk controller
     usually takes about 20 minutes.  Formatting on a UNIBUS disk
     controller takes significantly longer.  For every hundredth
     cylinder formatted _f_o_r_m_a_t prints a message indicating the
     current cylinder being formatted.	(This message is just to
     reassure people that nothing is is amiss.)

     _F_o_r_m_a_t uses the standard notation of the standalone I/O
     library in identifying a drive to be formatted.  A drive is
     specified as _z_z(_x,_y), where _z_z refers to the controller type
     (either _h_p or _u_p), _x is the unit number of the drive; 8
     times the UNIBUS or MASSBUS adaptor number plus the MASSBUS
     drive number or UNIBUS drive unit number; and _y is the file
     system partition on drive _x (this should always be 0). For
     example, ``hp(1,0)'' indicates that drive 1 on MASSBUS adap-
     tor 0 should be formatted; while ``up(10,0)'' indicates that
     UNIBUS drive 2 on UNIBUS adaptor 1 should be formatted.

     Before each formatting attempt, _f_o_r_m_a_t prompts the user in
     case debugging should be enabled in the appropriate device
     driver.  A carriage return disables debugging information.

     _F_o_r_m_a_t should be used prior to building file systems (with
     _n_e_w_f_s(8)) to insure that all sectors with uncorrectable
     media errors are remapped.  If a drive develops uncorrect-
     able defects after formatting, either _b_a_d_1_4_4(8) or _b_a_d_-
     _s_e_c_t(8) should be able to avoid the bad sectors.

     A sample run of _f_o_r_m_a_t is shown below. In this example
     (using a VAX-11/780), _f_o_r_m_a_t is loaded from the console
     floppy; on an 11/750 _f_o_r_m_a_t will be loaded from the root
     file system with _b_o_o_t(8) following a "B/3" command.  Bold-
     face means user input.  As usual, ``#'' and ``@'' may be
     used to edit input.

     The formatting procedures are different for each type of
     disk.  Listed here are the formatting procedures for RK07's,
     RP0X, and RM0X disks.

     You should shut down UNIX and halt the machine to do any
     disk formatting.  Make certain you put in the pack you want
     formatted.  It is also a good idea to spin down or write
     protect the disks you don't want to format, just in case.
