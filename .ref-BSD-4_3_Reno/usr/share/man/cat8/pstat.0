     _P_s_t_a_t interprets the contents of certain system tables.  If
     _c_o_r_e_f_i_l_e is given, the tables are sought there, otherwise in
     /_d_e_v/_k_m_e_m. The required namelist is taken from /_v_m_u_n_i_x
     unless _s_y_s_t_e_m is specified.  Options are

     of used pages which belong to text images.

     system tables and is useful for checking to see how full
     system tables have become if the system is under heavy load.

     It would be very useful if the system recorded "maximum
     occupancy" on the tables reported by --TT;; even more useful if
     these tables were dynamically allocated.
