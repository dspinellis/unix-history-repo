     _E_d_q_u_o_t_a is a quota editor.  By default, or if the -_u flag is
     specified, one or more users may be specified on the command
     line.  For each user a temporary file is created with an
     ASCII representation of the current disk quotas for that
     user.  The list of filesystems with user quotas is deter-
     mined from /_e_t_c/_f_s_t_a_b.  An editor is invoked on the ASCII
     file.  The editor invoked is _v_i(1) unless the environment
     variable EDITOR specifies otherwise.

     The quotas may then be modified, new quotas added, etc.
     Setting a quota to zero indicates that no quota should be
     imposed.  Setting a hard limit to one indicates that no
     allocations should be permitted.  Setting a soft limit to
     one with a hard limit of zero indicates that allocations
     should be permitted on only a temporary basis (see -_t
     below).  The current usage information in the file is for
     informational purposes; only the hard and soft limits can be
     changed.

     On leaving the editor, _e_d_q_u_o_t_a reads the temporary file and
     modifies the binary quota files to reflect the changes made.

     If the --pp option is specified, _e_d_q_u_o_t_a will duplicate the
     quotas of the prototypical user specified for each user
     specified.  This is the normal mechanism used to initialize
     quotas for groups of users.

     If the -_g flag is specified, _e_d_q_u_o_t_a is invoked to edit the
     quotas of one or more groups specified on the command line.
     The -_p flag can be specified in conjunction with the -_g flag
     to specify a prototypical group to be duplicated among the
     listed set of groups.

     Users are permitted to exceed their soft limits for a grace
     period that may be specified per filesystem.  Once the grace
     period has expired, the soft limit is enforced as a hard
     limit.  The default grace period for a filesystem is speci-
     fied in /_u_s_r/_i_n_c_l_u_d_e/_u_f_s/_q_u_o_t_a._h.	The -t flag can be used
     to change the grace period.  By default, or when invoked
     with the -_u flag, the grace period is set for all the
     filesystems with user quotas specified in /_e_t_c/_f_s_t_a_b.  When
     invoked with the -_g flag the grace period is set for all the

     filesystems with group quotas specified in /_e_t_c/_f_s_t_a_b.  The
     grace period may be specified in days, hours, minutes, or
     seconds.  Setting a grace period to zero indicates that the
     default grace period should be imposed.  Setting a grace
     period to one second indicates that no grace period should
     be granted.

     Only the super-user may edit quotas.
