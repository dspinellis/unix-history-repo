     _T_e_l_n_e_t_d is a server which supports the DARPA standard TTEELLNNEETT
     virtual terminal protocol.  _T_e_l_n_e_t_d is invoked by the inter-
     net server (see _i_n_e_t_d(8)), normally for requests to connect
     to the TTEELLNNEETT port as indicated by the /_e_t_c/_s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s file
     (see _s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s(5)).  If the --ddeebbuugg may be used, to start up
     tteellnneettdd manually, instead of through _i_n_e_t_d(8).  If started
     up this way, _p_o_r_t may be specified to run _t_e_l_n_e_t_d on an
     alternate TCP port number.

     The --DD option may be used for debugging purposes.	This
     allows _t_e_l_n_e_t to print out debugging information to the con-
     nection, allowing the user to see what telnetd is doing.
     There are several modifiers: ooppttiioonnss prints information
     about the negotiation of TTEELLNNEETT options, rreeppoorrtt prints the
     ooppttiioonnss information, plus some additional information about
     what processing is going on, nneettddaattaa displays the data
     stream received by _t_e_l_n_e_t_d, ppttyyddaattaa displays data written to
     the pty, and eexxeerrcciissee has not been implemented yet.

     _T_e_l_n_e_t_d operates by allocating a pseudo-terminal device (see
     _p_t_y(4)) for a client, then creating a login process which
     has the slave side of the pseudo-terminal as ssttddiinn, ssttddoouutt,
     and ssttddeerrrr.  _T_e_l_n_e_t_d manipulates the master side of the
     pseudo-terminal, implementing the TTEELLNNEETT protocol and pass-
     ing characters between the remote client and the login pro-
     cess.

     When a TTEELLNNEETT session is started up, _t_e_l_n_e_t_d sends TTEELLNNEETT
     options to the client side indicating a willingness to do
     _r_e_m_o_t_e _e_c_h_o of characters, to _s_u_p_p_r_e_s_s _g_o _a_h_e_a_d, to do
     _r_e_m_o_t_e _f_l_o_w _c_o_n_t_r_o_l, and to receive _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l _t_y_p_e _i_n_f_o_r_m_a_-
     _t_i_o_n, _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l _s_p_e_e_d _i_n_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n, and _w_i_n_d_o_w _s_i_z_e _i_n_f_o_r_m_a_-
     _t_i_o_n from the remote client.  If the remote client is wil-
     ling, the remote terminal type is propagated in the environ-
     ment of the created login process.  The pseudo-terminal
     allocated to the client is configured to operate in "cooked"
     mode, and with XTABS and CRMOD enabled (see _t_t_y(4)).

     _T_e_l_n_e_t_d is willing to _d_o: _e_c_h_o, _b_i_n_a_r_y, _s_u_p_p_r_e_s_s _g_o _a_h_e_a_d,
     and _t_i_m_i_n_g _m_a_r_k.  _T_e_l_n_e_t_d is willing to have the remote
     client _d_o: _l_i_n_e_m_o_d_e, _b_i_n_a_r_y, _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l _t_y_p_e, _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l _s_p_e_e_d,
     _w_i_n_d_o_w _s_i_z_e, _t_o_g_g_l_e _f_l_o_w _c_o_n_t_r_o_l, _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t, _X _d_i_s_p_l_a_y
     _l_o_c_a_t_i_o_n, and _s_u_p_p_r_e_s_s _g_o _a_h_e_a_d.

     Some TTEELLNNEETT commands are only partially implemented.

     Because of bugs in the original 4.2 BSD _t_e_l_n_e_t(1), _t_e_l_n_e_t_d
     performs some dubious protocol exchanges to try to discover
     if the remote client is, in fact, a 4.2 BSD _t_e_l_n_e_t(1).

     _B_i_n_a_r_y _m_o_d_e has no common interpretation except between
     similar operating systems (Unix in this case).

     The terminal type name received from the remote client is
     converted to lower case.

     _T_e_l_n_e_t_d never sends TTEELLNNEETT _g_o _a_h_e_a_d commands.
