     crash - what happens when the system crashes

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     This section explains what happens when the system crashes
     and (very briefly) how to analyze crash dumps.

     When the system crashes voluntarily it prints a message of
     the form

	  panic: why i gave up the ghost

     on the console, takes a dump on a mass storage peripheral,
     and then invokes an automatic reboot procedure as described
     in _r_e_b_o_o_t(8).  Unless some unexpected inconsistency is
     encountered in the state of the file systems due to hardware
     or software failure, the system will then resume multi-user
     operations.

     The system has a large number of internal consistency
     checks; if one of these fails, then it will panic with a
     very short message indicating which one failed.  In many
     instances, this will be the name of the routine which
     detected the error, or a two-word description of the incon-
     sistency.	A full understanding of most panic messages
     requires perusal of the source code for the system.

     The most common cause of system failures is hardware
     failure, which can reflect itself in different ways.  Here
     are the messages which are most likely, with some hints as
     to causes.  Left unstated in all cases is the possibility
     that hardware or software error produced the message in some
     unexpected way.

	  This cryptic panic message results from a failure to
	  mount the root filesystem during the bootstrap process.
	  Either the root filesystem has been corrupted, or the
	  system is attempting to use the wrong device as root
	  filesystem.  Usually, an alternate copy of the system
	  binary or an alternate root filesystem can be used to
	  bring up the system to investigate.

	  This is not a panic message, as reboots are likely to
	  be futile.  Late in the bootstrap procedure, the system
	  was unable to locate and execute the initialization
	  process, _i_n_i_t(8).  The root filesystem is incorrect or
	  has been corrupted, or the mode or type of /etc/init
	  forbids execution.

	  The system encountered an error trying to write to the
	  paging device or an error in reading critical informa-
	  tion from a disk drive.  The offending disk should be
	  fixed if it is broken or unreliable.

	  These panic messages are among those that may be pro-
	  duced when filesystem inconsistencies are detected.
	  The problem generally results from a failure to repair
	  damaged filesystems after a crash, hardware failures,
	  or other condition that should not normally occur.  A
	  filesystem check will normally correct the problem.

	  This really shouldn't be a panic, but until the data
	  structure involved is made to be extensible, running
	  out of entries causes a crash.  If this happens, make
	  the timeout table bigger.

	  An unexpected trap has occurred within the system; the
	  trap types are:

	  0    bus error
	  1    address error
	  2    illegal instruction
	  3    divide by zero
	  4    _c_h_k instruction
	  5    _t_r_a_p_v instruction
	  6    privileged instruction
	  7    trace trap
	  8    MMU fault
	  9    simulated software interrupt
	  10   format error
	  11   FP coprocessor fault
	  12   coprocessor fault
	  13   simulated AST

	  The favorite trap type in system crashes is trap type
	  8, indicating a wild reference.  ``code'' (hex) is the
	  concatenation of the MMU status register (see
	  <hp300/cpu.h>) in the high 16 bits and the 68020 spe-
	  cial status word (see the 68020 manual, page 6-17) in
	  the low 16.  ``v'' (hex) is the virtual address which

	  caused the fault.  Additionally, the kernel will dump
	  about a screenful of semi-useful information.  ``pid''
	  (decimal) is the process id of the process running at
	  the time of the exception.  Note that if we panic in an
	  interrupt routine, this process may not be related to
	  the panic.  ``ps'' (hex) is the 68020 processor status
	  register ``ps''.  ``pc'' (hex) is the value of the pro-
	  gram counter saved on the hardware exception frame.  It
	  may _n_o_t be the PC of the instruction causing the fault.
	  ``sfc'' and ``dfc'' (hex) are the 68020
	  source/destination function codes.  They should always
	  be one.  ``p0'' and ``p1'' are the VAX-like region
	  registers.  They are of the form:

	       <length> '@' <kernel VA>

	  where both are in hex.  Following these values are a
	  dump of the processor registers (hex).  Finally, is a
	  dump of the stack (user/kernel) at the time of the
	  offense.

     iinniitt ddiieedd
	  The system initialization process has exited.  This is
	  bad news, as no new users will then be able to log in.
	  Rebooting is the only fix, so the system just does it
	  right away.

	  The network has exhausted its private page map for net-
	  work buffers.  This usually indicates that buffers are
	  being lost, and rather than allow the system to slowly
	  degrade, it reboots immediately.  The map may be made
	  larger if necessary.

     That completes the list of panic types you are likely to
     see.

     When the system crashes it writes (or at least attempts to
     write) an image of memory into the back end of the dump dev-
     ice, usually the same as the primary swap area.  After the
     system is rebooted, the program _s_a_v_e_c_o_r_e(8) runs and
     preserves a copy of this core image and the current system
     in a specified directory for later perusal.  See _s_a_v_e_c_o_r_e(8)
     for details.

     To analyze a dump you should begin by running _a_d_b(1) with
     the --kk flag on the system load image and core dump.  If the
     core image is the result of a panic, the panic message is
     printed.  Normally the command ``$c'' will provide a stack
     trace from the point of the crash and this will provide a
     clue as to what went wrong.  A more complete discussion of
     system debugging is impossible here.  See, however, ``Using
