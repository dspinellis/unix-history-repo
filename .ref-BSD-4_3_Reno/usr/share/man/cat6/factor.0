     The _f_a_c_t_o_r utility will factor integers between -2147483648
     and 2147483647 inclusive.	When a number is factored, it is
     printed, followed by a ``:'', and the list of factors on a
     single line.  Factors are listed in ascending order, and are
     preceded by a space.  If a factor divides a value more than
     once, it will be printed more than once.

     When _f_a_c_t_o_r is invoked with one or more arguments, each
     argument will be factored.

     When _f_a_c_t_o_r is invoked with no arguments, _f_a_c_t_o_r reads
     numbers, one per line, from standard input, until end of
     file or error.  Leading white-space and empty lines are
     ignored.  Numbers may be preceded by a single - or +.
     Numbers are terminated by a non-digit character (such as a
     newline).	After a number is read, it is factored.  Input
     lines must not be longer than 255 characters.

     The _p_r_i_m_e_s utility prints primes in ascending order, one per
     line, starting at or above ssttaarrtt and continuing until, but
     not including ssttoopp.. The ssttaarrtt value must be at least 0 and
     not greater than ssttoopp.. The ssttoopp value must not be greater
     than 4294967295.  The default value of ssttoopp is 4294967295.

     When the _p_r_i_m_e_s utility is invoked with no arguments, ssttaarrtt
     is read from standard input.  SSttoopp is taken to be
     4294967295.  The ssttaarrtt value may be preceded by a single +.
     The ssttaarrtt value is terminated by a non-digit character (such
     as a newline).  The input line must not be longer than 255
     characters.

     Out of range or invalid input results in `ouch' being writ-
     ten to standard error.

BBUUGGSS
     _F_a_c_t_o_r cannot handle the ``10 most wanted'' factor list,
     _p_r_i_m_e_s won't get you a world record.
