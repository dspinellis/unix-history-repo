     _T_r_e_k is a game of space glory and war.  Below is a summary
     of commands.  For complete documentation, see _T_r_e_k by Eric
     Allman.

     If a filename is given, a log of the game is written onto
     that file.  If the --aa flag is given before the filename,
     that file is appended to, not truncated.

     The game will ask you what length game you would like.
     Valid responses are "short", "medium", and "long".  You may
     also type "restart", which restarts a previously saved game.
     You will then be prompted for the skill, to which you must
     respond "novice", "fair", "good", "expert", "commadore", or
     "impossible".  You should normally start out with a novice
     and work up.

     In general, throughout the game, if you forget what is
     appropriate the game will tell you what it expects if you
     just type in a question mark.
