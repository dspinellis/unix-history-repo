     _A_t_c lets you try your hand at the nerve wracking duties of
     the air traffic controller without endangering the lives of
     millions of travelers each year.  Your responsibilities
     require you to direct the flight of jets and prop planes
     into and out of the flight arena and airports.  The speed
     (update time) and frequency of the planes depend on the dif-
     ficulty of the chosen arena.

     Your goal in _a_t_c is to keep the game going as long as possi-
     ble. There is no winning state, except to beat the times of
     other players.  You will need to: launch planes at airports
     (by instructing them to increase their altitude); land
     planes at airports (by instructing them to go to altitude
     zero when exactly over the airport); and maneuver planes out
     of exit points.

     Several things will cause the end of the game.  Each plane
     has a destination (see information area), and sending a
     plane to the wrong destination is an error.  Planes can run

     out of fuel, or can collide.  Collision is defined as adja-
     cency in any of the three dimensions.  A plane leaving the
     arena in any other way than through its destination exit is
     an error as well.

     Scores are sorted in order of the number of planes safe.
     The other statistics are provided merely for fun.	There is
     no penalty for taking longer than another player (except in
     the case of ties).

     Suspending a game is not permitted.  If you get a talk mes-
     sage, tough.  When was the last time an Air Traffic Con-
     troller got called away to the phone?

     Depending on the terminal you run _a_t_c on, the screen will be
     divided into 4 areas. It should be stressed that the termi-
     nal driver portion of the game was designed to be reconfi-
     gurable, so the display format can vary depending the ver-
     sion you are playing.  The descriptions here are based on
     the ascii version of the game.  The game rules and input
     format, however, should remain consistent.  Control-L
     redraws the screen, should it become muddled.

     RRAADDAARR

	  The first screen area is the radar display, showing the
	  relative locations of the planes, airports, standard
	  entry/exit points, radar beacons, and "lines" which
	  simply serve to aid you in guiding the planes.

	  Planes are shown as a single letter with an altitude.
	  If the numerical altitude is a single digit, then it
	  represents thousands of feet.  Some distinction is made
	  between the prop planes and the jets.  On ascii termi-
	  nals, prop planes are represented by a upper case
	  letter, jets by a lower case letter.

	  Airports are shown as a number and some indication of
	  the direction planes must be going to land at the air-
	  port. On ascii terminals, this is one of '^', '>', '<',
	  and 'v', to indicate north (0 degrees), east (90), west
	  (270) and south (180), respectively.	The planes will
	  also take off in this direction.

	  Beacons are represented as circles or asterisks and a
	  number.  Their purpose is to offer a place of easy
	  reference to the plane pilots.  See 'the delay command'
	  under the input section of this manual.

	  Entry/exit points are displayed as numbers along the
	  border of the radar screen.  Planes will enter the



Printed 7/27/90               June				2






ATC(6)			      1990			   ATC(6)



	  arena from these points without warning.  These points
	  have a direction associated with them, and planes will
	  always enter the arena from this direction.  On the
	  ascii version of _a_t_c, this direction is not displayed.
	  It will become apparent what this direction is as the
	  game progresses.

	  Incoming planes will always enter at the same altitude:
	  7000 feet.  For a plane to successfully depart through
	  an entry/exit point, it must be flying at 9000 feet.
	  It is not necessary for the planes to be flying in any
	  particular direction when they leave the arena (yet).

     IINNFFOORRMMAATTIIOONN AARREEAA

	  The second area of the display is the information area,
	  which lists the time (number of updates since start),
	  and the number of planes you have directed safely out
	  of the arena.  Below this is a list of planes currently
	  in the air, followed by a blank line, and then a list
	  of planes on the ground (at airports).  Each line lists
	  the plane name and its current altitude, an optional
	  asterisk indicating low fuel, the plane's destination,
	  and the plane's current command.  Changing altitude is
	  not considered to be a command and is therefore not
	  displayed.  The following are some possible information
	  lines:

	       B4*A0: Circle @ b1
	       g7 E4: 225

	  The first example shows a prop plane named 'B' that is
	  flying at 4000 feet.	It is low on fuel (note the '*').
	  It's destination is Airport #0.  The next command it
	  expects to do is circle when it reaches Beacon #1.  The
	  second example shows a jet named 'g' at 7000 feet, des-
	  tined for Exit #4.  It is just now executing a turn to
	  225 degrees (South-West).

	  The third area of the display is the input area.  It is
	  here that your input is reflected.  See the INPUT head-
	  ing of this manual for more details.

     A command completion interface is built into the game.  At
     any time, typing '?' will list possible input characters.
     Typing a backspace (your erase character) backs up, erasing
     the last part of the command.  When a command is complete, a
     return enters it, and any semantic checking is done at that
     time.  If no errors are detected, the command is sent to the
     appropriate plane.  If an error is discovered during the
     check, the offending statement will be underscored and a
     (hopefully) descriptive message will be printed under it.

     The command syntax is broken into two parts: _I_m_m_e_d_i_a_t_e _O_n_l_y
     and _D_e_l_a_y_a_b_l_e commands.  _I_m_m_e_d_i_a_t_e _O_n_l_y commands happen on
     the next update. _D_e_l_a_y_a_b_l_e commands also happen on the next
     update unless they are followed by an optional predicate
     called the _D_e_l_a_y command.

     In the following tables, the syntax [[00--99]] means any single
     digit, and <<ddiirr>> refers to the keys around the 's' key,
     namely ``wedcxzaq''.  In absolute references, 'q' refers to
     North-West or 315 degrees, and 'w' refers to North, or 0
     degrees. In relative references, 'q' refers to -45 degrees
     or 45 degrees left, and 'w' refers to 0 degrees, or no
     change in direction.

     All commands start with a plane letter.  This indicates the
     recipient of the command.	Case is ignored.

     Planes are mmaarrkkeedd when they enter the arena.  This means
     they are displayed in highlighted mode on the radar display.
     A plane may also be either uunnmmaarrkkeedd or iiggnnoorreedd.. An uunnmmaarrkkeedd
     plane is drawn in unhighlighted mode, and a line of dashes
     is displayed in the command field of the information area.
     The plane will remain this way until a mark command has been
     issued.  Any other command will be issued, but the command
     line will return to a line of dashes when the command is
     completed.

     An iiggnnoorreedd plane is treated the same as an unmarked plane,
     except that it will automatically switch to mmaarrkkeedd status
     when a delayed command has been processed.  This is useful
     if you want to forget about a plane for a while, but its
     flight path has not yet been completely set.

     As with all of the commands, marking, unmarking and ignoring
     will take effect at the beginning of the next update.  Do
     not be surprised if the plane does not immediately switch to
     unhighlighted mode.

     Planes waiting at airports can only be told to take off
     (climb in altitude).

NNEEWW GGAAMMEESS
     The GGaammee__LLiisstt file lists the currently available play
     fields.  New field description file names must be placed in
     this file to be 'playable'.  If a player specifies a game
     not in this file, his score will not be logged.

     The game field description files are broken into two parts.
     The first part is the definition section.	Here, the four
     tunable game parameters must be set.  These variables are
     set with the syntax:

	  variable = number;

     Variable may be one of: uuppddaattee,, indicating the number of
     seconds between forced updates; nneewwppllaannee,, indicating (about)
     the number of updates between new plane entries; wwiiddtthh,,
     indicating the width of the play field; and hheeiigghhtt,, indicat-
     ing the height of the play field.

     The second part of the field description files describes the
     locations of the exits, the beacons, the airports and the
     lines.  The syntax is as follows:

	  beacon:   (x y) ... ;
	  airport:  (x y direction) ... ;
	  exit:     (x y direction) ... ;
	  line:     [ (x1 y1) (x2 y2) ] ... ;

     For beacons, a simple x, y coordinate pair is used (enclosed
     in parenthesis).  Airports and exits require a third value,
     a direction, which is one of wweeddccxxzzaaqq.. For airports, this is
     the direction that planes must be going to take off and
     land, and for exits, this is the direction that planes will
     going when they eenntteerr the arena.  This may not seem intui-
     tive, but as there is no restriction on direction of exit,
     this is appropriate.  Lines are slightly different, since
     they need two coordinate pairs to specify the line end-
     points.  These endpoints must be enclosed in square brack-
     ets.

     All statements are semi-colon (;) terminated.  Multiple item
     statements accumulate.  Each definition must occur exactly
     once, before any item statements.	Comments begin with a
     hash (#) symbol and terminate with a newline.  The coordi-
     nates are between zero and width-1 and height-1 inclusive.
     All of the exit coordinates must lie on the borders, and all
     of the beacons and airports must lie inside of the borders.
     Line endpoints may be anywhere within the field, so long as
     the lines are horizontal, vertical or eexxaaccttllyy ddiiaaggoonnaall..
