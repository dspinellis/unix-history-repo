     _H_a_c_k is a display oriented dungeons & dragons - like game.
     Both display and command structure resemble rogue.  (For a
     game with the same structure but entirely different display
     - a real cave instead of dull rectangles - try Quest.)

     To get started you really only need to know two commands.
     The command ?? will give you a list of the available commands
     and the command // will identify the things you see on the
     screen.

     To win the game (as opposed to merely playing to beat other
     people high scores) you must locate the Amulet of Yendor
     which is somewhere below the 20th level of the dungeon and
     get it out.  Nobody has achieved this yet and if somebody
     does, he will probably go down in history as a hero among
     heros.

     When the game ends, either by your death, when you quit, or
     if you escape from the caves, _h_a_c_k will give you (a fragment
     of) the list of top scorers.  The scoring is based on many
     aspects of your behaviour but a rough estimate is obtained
     by taking the amount of gold you've found in the cave plus
     four times your (real) experience. Precious stones may be
     worth a lot of gold when brought to the exit.  There is a
     10% penalty for getting yourself killed.

     The administration of the game is kept in the directory
     specified with the --dd option, or, if no such option is
     given, in the directory specified by the environment vari-
     able HACKDIR, or, if no such variable exists, in the current
     directory. This same directory contains several auxiliary
     files such as lockfiles and the list of topscorers and a
     subdirectory _s_a_v_e where games are saved.  The game adminis-
     trator may however choose to install hack with a fixed play-
     ing ground, usually /usr/games/lib/hackdir.

     The --nn option suppresses printing of the news.

     The --uu _p_l_a_y_e_r_n_a_m_e option supplies the answer to the question
     "Who are you?".  When _p_l_a_y_e_r_n_a_m_e has as suffix one of --TT --SS
     --KK --FF --CC --WW then this supplies the answer to the question
     "What kind of character ... ?".

     The --ss option will print out the list of your scores. It may
     be followed by arguments --XX where X is one of the letters C,
     F, K, S, T, W to print the scores of Cavemen, Fighters,
     Knights, Speleologists, Tourists or Wizards.  It may also be
     followed by one or more player names to print the scores of
     the players mentioned.

AAUUTTHHOORRSS
     Jay Fenlason (+ Kenny Woodland, Mike Thome and Jon Payne)
     wrote the original hack, very much like rogue (but full of
     bugs).
     Andries Brouwer continuously deformed their sources into the
     current version - in fact an entirely different game.
