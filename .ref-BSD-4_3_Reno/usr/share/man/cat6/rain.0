     _R_a_i_n's display is modeled after the VAX/VMS program  of  the
     same  name.   The	terminal  has  to be set for 9600 baud to
     obtain the proper effect.

     As with all programs that use _t_e_r_m_c_a_p, the TERM  environment
     variable  must be set (and exported) to the type of the ter-
     minal being used.
