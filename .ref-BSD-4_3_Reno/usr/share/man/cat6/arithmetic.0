     _A_r_i_t_h_m_e_t_i_c asks you to solve problems in simple arithmetic.
     Each question must be answered correctly before going on to
     the next.	After every 20 problems, it prints the score so
     far and the time taken.  You can quit at any time by typing
     the interrupt or end-of-file character.

     The options are as follows:

     -o   By default, _a_r_i_t_h_m_e_t_i_c asks questions on addition of
	  numbers from 0 to 10, and corresponding subtraction.
	  By supplying one or more of the characters ++--xx//, you
	  can ask for problems in addition, subtraction, multi-
	  plication, and division, respectively.  If you give one
	  of these characters more than once, that kind of prob-
	  lem will be asked correspondingly more often.

     -r   If a _r_a_n_g_e is supplied, _a_r_i_t_h_m_e_t_i_c selects the numbers
	  in its problems in the following way.  For addition and
	  multiplication, the numbers to be added or multiplied
	  are between 0 and _r_a_n_g_e, inclusive.  For subtraction
	  and division, both the required result and the number
	  to divide by or subtract will be between 0 and _r_a_n_g_e.
	  (Of course, _a_r_i_t_h_m_e_t_i_c will not ask you to divide by
	  0.)  The default _r_a_n_g_e is 10.

     When you get a problem wrong, _a_r_i_t_h_m_e_t_i_c will remember the
     numbers involved, and will tend to select those numbers more
     often than others, in problems of the same sort.  Eventually
     it will forgive and forget.

     _A_r_i_t_h_m_e_t_i_c cannot be persuaded to tell you the right answer.
     You must work it out for yourself.

     ``What?'' if you get a question wrong.  ``Right!'' if you
     get it right.  ``Please type a number.'' if arithmetic
     doesn't understand what you typed.
