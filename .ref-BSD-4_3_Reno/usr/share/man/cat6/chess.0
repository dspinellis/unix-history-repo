     _C_h_e_s_s plays a game of chess against the user or it plays
     against itself.

     _C_h_e_s_s has a simple alpha-numeric board display or it can be
     compiled for use with the CHESSTOOL program on a SUN works-
     tation.  The program gets its opening moves from the file
     gnuchess.book which should be located in the same directory
     as gnuchess.  To invoke the prgram, type 'gnuchess' or type
     'chesstool gnuchess' on a SUN workstation where 'CHESSTOOL'
     is installed.  The 'gnuchess' command can be followed by up
     to 2 command line arguments.  If one argument is given it
     determines the programs search time in seconds.  If two
     arguments are given, they will be used to set tournament
     time controls with the first argument being the number of
     moves and the second being the total clock time in minutes.
     Thus, entering 'chess 60 5' will set the clocks for 5
     minutes (300 seconds) for the first 60 moves.  If no argu-
     ment is given the program will prompt the user for level of
     play.  For use with CHESSTOOL, see the documentation on that
     program.

     Once _C_h_e_s_s is invoked, the program will display the board
     and prompt the user for a move. To enter a move, use the
     notation 'e2e4' where the first letter-number pair indicates
     the origination square and the second letter-number pair
     indicates the destination square.	An alternative is to use
     the notation 'nf3' where the first letter indicates the
     piece type (p,n,b,r,q,k).	To castle, type the origin and
     destination squares of the king just as you would do for a
     regular move, or type "o-o" for kingside castling and "o-o-
     o" for queenside.

     In addition to legal moves, the following commands are
     available as responses.

     _b_e_e_p -- causes the program to beep after each move.

     _b_d -- updates the current board position on the display.

     _b_o_o_k -- turns off use of the opening library.

     _b_o_t_h -- causes the computer to play both sides of a chess
     game.

     _b_l_a_c_k -- causes the computer to take the black pieces with
     the move and begin searching.

     _l_e_v_e_l -- allows the user to set time controls such as 60
     moves in 5 minutes etc.  In tournament mode, the program
     will vary the time it takes for each move depending on the
     situation.  If easy mode is disabled (using the 'easy' com-
     mand), the program will often respond with its move immedi-
     ately, saving time on its clock for use later on.

     _d_e_p_t_h -- allows the user to change the search depth of the
     program.  The maximum depth is 29 ply.  Normally the depth
     is set to 29 and the computer terminates its search based on
     elapsed time rather than depth.  Using the depth command
     allows setting depth to say 4 ply and setting response time
     to a large number such as 9999 seconds. The program will
     then search until all moves have been examined to a depth of
     4 ply (with extensions up to 11 additional ply for sequences
     of checks and captures).

     _e_a_s_y -- toggles easy mode (thinking on opponents time) on
     and off. The default is easy mode ON.  If easy mode is dis-
     abled, the user must enter a 'break' or '^C' to get the pro-
     grams attention before entering each move.

     _e_d_i_t -- allows the user to set up a board position.  In this
     mode, the '#' command will clear the board, the 'c' command
     will toggle piece color, and the '.' command will exit setup
     mode.  Pieces are entered by typing a letter (p,n,b,r,q,k)
     for the piece followed by the coordinate.	For example "pb3"
     would place a pawn on square b3.

     _f_o_r_c_e -- allows the user to enter moves for both sides. To
     get the program to play after a sequence of moves has been
     entered use the 'white' or 'black' commands.

     _g_e_t -- retrieves a game from disk.  The program will prompt
     the user for a file name.

     _h_e_l_p -- displays a short description of the commands.

     _h_i_n_t -- causes the program to supply the user with its
     predicted move.

     _l_i_s_t -- writes the game moves and some statistics on search
     depth, nodes, and time to the file 'chess.lst'.

     _n_e_w -- starts a new game.

     _p_o_s_t -- causes the program to display the principle varia-
     tion and the score during the search.  A score of 100 is
     equivalent to a 1 pawn advantage for the computer.

     _r_a_n_d_o_m -- causes the program to randomize its move selection
     slightly.

     _r_e_v_e_r_s_e -- causes the board display to be reversed.  That
     is, the white pieces will now appear at the top of the
     board.

     _q_u_i_t -- exits the game.

     _s_a_v_e -- saves a game to disk.  The program will prompt the
     user for a file name.

     _s_w_i_t_c_h -- causes the program to switch places with the
     opponent and begin searching.

     _u_n_d_o -- undoes the last move whether it was the computer's
     or the human's. You may also type "remove". This is
     equivalent to two "undo's" (e.g. retract one move for each
     side).

     _w_h_i_t_e -- causes the computer to take the white pieces with
     the move and begin searching.

BBUUGGSS
     Pawn promotion to pieces other than a queen is not allowed.
     En-Passant does not work properly with CHESSTOOOL.  The
     transposition table may not work properly in some positions
     so the default is to turn this off.
