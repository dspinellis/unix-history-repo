     Limits the consumption by the current process and each pro-
     cess it creates to not individually exceed _v_a_l_u_e on the
     specified _r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e. If _v_a_l_u_e is specified as -1, then the
     current limit is returned and the limit is unchanged.  The
     resources which are currently controllable are:

     LIM_NORAISE    A pseudo-limit; if set non-zero then the lim-
		    its may not be raised.  Only the super-user
		    may remove the _n_o_r_a_i_s_e restriction.

     LIM_CPU	    the maximum number of cpu-seconds to be used
		    by each process

     LIM_FSIZE	    the largest single file which can be created

     LIM_DATA	    the maximum growth of the data+stack region
		    via _s_b_r_k(2) beyond the end of the program
		    text

     LIM_STACK	    the maximum size of the automatically-
		    extended stack region

     LIM_CORE	    the size of the largest core dump that will
		    be created.

     LIM_MAXRSS     a soft limit for the amount of physical
		    memory (in bytes) to be given to the program.
		    If memory is tight, the system will prefer to
		    take memory from processes which are exceed-
		    ing their declared LIM_MAXRSS.

     Because this information is stored in the per-process infor-
     mation this system call must be executed directly by the
     shell if it is to affect all future processes created by the
     shell; _l_i_m_i_t is thus a built-in command to _c_s_h(1).

     The system refuses to extend the data or stack space when
     the limits would be exceeded in the normal way; a _b_r_e_a_k call
     fails if the data space limit is reached, or the process is
     killed when the stack limit is reached (since the stack

     cannot be extended, there is no way to send a signal!).

     A file i/o operation which would create a file which is too
     large will cause a signal SIGXFSZ to be generated, this nor-
     mally terminates the process, but may be caught.  When the
     cpu time limit is exceeded, a signal SIGXCPU is sent to the
     offending process; to allow it time to process the signal it
     is given 5 seconds grace by raising the cpu time limit.
