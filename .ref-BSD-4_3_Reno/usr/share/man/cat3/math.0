     These functions constitute the C math library, _l_i_b_m. The
     link editor searches this library under the "-lm" option.
     Declarations for these functions may be obtained from the
     include file <_m_a_t_h._h>.  The Fortran math library is
     described in ``man 3f intro''.

NNOOTTEESS
     In 4.3 BSD, distributed from the University of California in
     late 1985, most of the foregoing functions come in two ver-
     sions, one for the double-precision "D" format in the DEC
     VAX-11 family of computers, another for double-precision
     arithmetic conforming to the IEEE Standard 754 for Binary
     Floating-Point Arithmetic.  The two versions behave very
     similarly, as should be expected from programs more accurate
     and robust than was the norm when UNIX was born.  For
     instance, the programs are accurate to within the numbers of
     _u_l_ps tabulated above; an _u_l_p is one _Unit in the _Last _Place.
     And the programs have been cured of anomalies that afflicted
     the older math library _l_i_b_m in which incidents like the fol-
     lowing had been reported:
	  sqrt(-1.0) = 0.0 and log(-1.0) = -1.7e38.
	  cos(1.0e-11) > cos(0.0) > 1.0.
	  pow(x,1.0) != x when x = 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, ..., 9.0.
	  pow(-1.0,1.0e10) trapped on Integer Overflow.
	  sqrt(1.0e30) and sqrt(1.0e-30) were very slow.
     However the two versions do differ in ways that have to be
     explained, to which end the following notes are provided.

     This is the format for which the original math library _l_i_b_m
     was developed, and to which this manual is still principally
     dedicated.  It is _t_h_e double-precision format for the PDP-11
     and the earlier VAX-11 machines; VAX-11s after 1983 were
     provided with an optional "G" format closer to the IEEE
     double-precision format.  The earlier DEC MicroVAXs have no
     D format, only G double-precision. (Why?  Why not?)

     Properties of D_floating-point:
	  Wordsize: 64 bits, 8 bytes.  Radix: Binary.
	  Precision: 56 sig.  bits, roughly like 17 sig.
	  decimals.
	       If x and x' are consecutive positive
	       D_floating-point numbers (they differ by 1 _u_l_p),
	       then
	       1.3e-17 < 0.5**56 < (x'-x)/x <_ 0.5**55 < 2.8e-17.
	  Range: Overflow threshold  = 2.0**127 = 1.7e38.
		 Underflow threshold = 0.5**128 = 2.9e-39.
		 NOTE:	THIS RANGE IS COMPARATIVELY NARROW.
	       Overflow customarily stops computation.
	       Underflow is customarily flushed quietly to zero.
	       CAUTION:
		    It is possible to have x != y and yet x-y = 0
		    because of underflow.  Similarly x > y > 0
		    cannot prevent either x*y = 0 or  y/x = 0
		    from happening without warning.

	  Zero is represented ambiguously.
	       Although 2**55 different representations of zero
	       are accepted by the hardware, only the obvious
	       representation is ever produced.  There is no -0
	       on a VAX.
	  Infinity is not part of the VAX architecture.
	  Reserved operands:
	       of the 2**55 that the hardware recognizes, only
	       one of them is ever produced.  Any floating-point
	       operation upon a reserved operand, even a MOVF or
	       MOVD, customarily stops computation, so they are
	       not much used.
	  Exceptions:
	       Divisions by zero and operations that overflow are
	       invalid operations that customarily stop computa-
	       tion or, in earlier machines, produce reserved
	       operands that will stop computation.
	  Rounding:
	       Every rational operation  (+, -, *, /) on a VAX
	       (but not necessarily on a PDP-11), if not an
	       over/underflow nor division by zero, is rounded to
	       within half an _u_l_p, and when the rounding error is
	       exactly half an _u_l_p then rounding is away from 0.

     Except for its narrow range, D_floating-point is one of the
     better computer arithmetics designed in the 1960's.  Its
     properties are reflected fairly faithfully in the elementary
     functions for a VAX distributed in 4.3 BSD.  They
     over/underflow only if their results have to lie out of
     range or very nearly so, and then they behave much as any
     rational arithmetic operation that over/underflowed would
     behave.  Similarly, expressions like log(0) and atanh(1)
     behave like 1/0; and sqrt(-3) and acos(3) behave like 0/0;
     they all produce reserved operands and/or stop computation!
     The situation is described in more detail in manual pages.

     How do the functions in 4.3 BSD's new _l_i_b_m for UNIX compare
     with their counterparts in DEC's VAX/VMS library?	Some of
     the VMS functions are a little faster, some are a little
     more accurate, some are more puritanical about exceptions
     (like pow(0.0,0.0) and atan2(0.0,0.0)), and most occupy much
     more memory than their counterparts in _l_i_b_m.  The VMS codes
     interpolate in large table to achieve speed and accuracy;
     the _l_i_b_m codes use tricky formulas compact enough that all
     of them may some day fit into a ROM.

     More important, DEC regards the VMS codes as proprietary and
     guards them zealously against unauthorized use.  But the
     _l_i_b_m codes in 4.3 BSD are intended for the public domain;
     they may be copied freely provided their provenance is
     always acknowledged, and provided users assist the authors
     in their researches by reporting experience with the codes.
     Therefore no user of UNIX on a machine whose arithmetic
     resembles VAX D_floating-point need use anything worse than
     the new _l_i_b_m.

     This standard is on its way to becoming more widely adopted
     than any other design for computer arithmetic.  VLSI chips
     that conform to some version of that standard have been pro-
     duced by a host of manufacturers, among them ...
	  Intel i8087, i80287	   National Semiconductor  32081
	  Motorola 68881	   Weitek WTL-1032, ... , -1165
	  Zilog Z8070		   Western Electric (AT&T) WE32106.
     Other implementations range from software, done thoroughly
     in the Apple Macintosh, through VLSI in the Hewlett-Packard
     9000 series, to the ELXSI 6400 running ECL at 3 Megaflops.
     Several other companies have adopted the formats of IEEE 754
     without, alas, adhering to the standard's way of handling
     rounding and exceptions like over/underflow.  The DEC VAX
     G_floating-point format is very similar to the IEEE 754 Dou-
     ble format, so similar that the C programs for the IEEE ver-
     sions of most of the elementary functions listed above could
     easily be converted to run on a MicroVAX, though nobody has
     volunteered to do that yet.

     The codes in 4.3 BSD's _l_i_b_m for machines that conform to
     IEEE 754 are intended primarily for the National Semi. 32081
     and WTL 1164/65.  To use these codes with the Intel or Zilog
     chips, or with the Apple Macintosh or ELXSI 6400, is to
     forego the use of better codes provided (perhaps freely) by
     those companies and designed by some of the authors of the
     codes above.  Except for _a_t_a_n, _c_a_b_s, _c_b_r_t, _e_r_f, _e_r_f_c, _h_y_p_o_t,
     _j_0-_j_n, _l_g_a_m_m_a, _p_o_w and _y_0-_y_n, the Motorola 68881 has all the
     functions in _l_i_b_m on chip, and faster and more accurate; it,
     Apple, the i8087, Z8070 and WE32106 all use 64 sig.  bits.
     The main virtue of 4.3 BSD's _l_i_b_m codes is that they are
     intended for the public domain; they may be copied freely
     provided their provenance is always acknowledged, and pro-
     vided users assist the authors in their researches by
     reporting experience with the codes.  Therefore no user of
     UNIX on a machine that conforms to IEEE 754 need use any-
     thing worse than the new _l_i_b_m.

     Properties of IEEE 754 Double-Precision:
	  Wordsize: 64 bits, 8 bytes.  Radix: Binary.
	  Precision: 53 sig.  bits, roughly like 16 sig.

	  decimals.
	       If x and x' are consecutive positive
	       Double-Precision numbers (they differ by 1 _u_l_p),
	       then
	       1.1e-16 < 0.5**53 < (x'-x)/x <_ 0.5**52 < 2.3e-16.
	  Range: Overflow threshold  = 2.0**1024 = 1.8e308
		 Underflow threshold = 0.5**1022 = 2.2e-308
	       Overflow goes by default to a signed Infinity.
	       Underflow is _G_r_a_d_u_a_l, rounding to the nearest
	       integer multiple of 0.5**1074 = 4.9e-324.
	  Zero is represented ambiguously as +0 or -0.
	       Its sign transforms correctly through multiplica-
	       tion or division, and is preserved by addition of
	       zeros with like signs; but x-x yields +0 for every
	       finite x.  The only operations that reveal zero's
	       sign are division by zero and copysign(x,+_0).  In
	       particular, comparison (x > y, x >_ y, etc.) cannot
	       be affected by the sign of zero; but if finite x =
	       y then Infinity = 1/(x-y) != -1/(y-x) = -Infinity.
	  Infinity is signed.
	       it persists when added to itself or to any finite
	       number.	Its sign transforms correctly through
	       multiplication and division, and
	       (finite)/+_Infinity = +_0 (nonzero)/0 = +_Infinity.
	       But Infinity-Infinity, Infinity*0 and
	       Infinity/Infinity are, like 0/0 and sqrt(-3),
	       invalid operations that produce _N_a_N. ...
	  Reserved operands:
	       there are 2**53-2 of them, all called _N_a_N (_Not _a
	       _Number).  Some, called Signaling _N_a_Ns, trap any
	       floating-point operation performed upon them; they
	       are used to mark missing or uninitialized values,
	       or nonexistent elements of arrays.  The rest are
	       Quiet _N_a_Ns; they are the default results of
	       Invalid Operations, and propagate through subse-
	       quent arithmetic operations.  If x != x then x is
	       _N_a_N; every other predicate (x > y, x = y, x < y,
	       ...) is FALSE if _N_a_N is involved.
	       NOTE: Trichotomy is violated by _N_a_N.
		    Besides being FALSE, predicates that entail
		    ordered comparison, rather than mere
		    (in)equality, signal Invalid Operation when
		    _N_a_N is involved.
	  Rounding:
	       Every algebraic operation (+, -, *, /, sqrt) is
	       rounded by default to within half an _u_l_p, and when
	       the rounding error is exactly half an _u_l_p then the
	       rounded value's least significant bit is zero.
	       This kind of rounding is usually the best kind,
	       sometimes provably so; for instance, for every x =
	       1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, ..., 2.0**52, we find
	       (x/3.0)*3.0 == x and (x/10.0)*10.0 == x and ...

	       despite that both the quotients and the products
	       have been rounded.  Only rounding like IEEE 754
	       can do that.  But no single kind of rounding can
	       be proved best for every circumstance, so IEEE 754
	       provides rounding towards zero or towards +Infin-
	       ity or towards -Infinity at the programmer's
	       option.	And the same kinds of rounding are speci-
	       fied for Binary-Decimal Conversions, at least for
	       magnitudes between roughly 1.0e-10 and 1.0e37.
	  Exceptions:
	       IEEE 754 recognizes five kinds of floating-point
	       exceptions, listed below in declining order of
	       probable importance.
		    Exception		   Default Result
		    __________________________________________
		    Invalid Operation	   _N_a_N, or FALSE
		    Overflow		   +_Infinity
		    Divide by Zero	   +_Infinity
		    Underflow		   Gradual Underflow
		    Inexact		   Rounded value
	       NOTE:  An Exception is not an Error unless handled
	       badly.  What makes a class of exceptions excep-
	       tional is that no single default response can be
	       satisfactory in every instance.	On the other
	       hand, if a default response will serve most
	       instances satisfactorily, the unsatisfactory
	       instances cannot justify aborting computation
	       every time the exception occurs.

	  For each kind of floating-point exception, IEEE 754
	  provides a Flag that is raised each time its exception
	  is signaled, and stays raised until the program resets
	  it.  Programs may also test, save and restore a flag.
	  Thus, IEEE 754 provides three ways by which programs
	  may cope with exceptions for which the default result
	  might be unsatisfactory:

	  1)  Test for a condition that might cause an exception
	      later, and branch to avoid the exception.

	  2)  Test a flag to see whether an exception has
	      occurred since the program last reset its flag.

	  3)  Test a result to see whether it is a value that
	      only an exception could have produced.
	      CAUTION: The only reliable ways to discover whether
	      Underflow has occurred are to test whether products
	      or quotients lie closer to zero than the underflow
	      threshold, or to test the Underflow flag.  (Sums
	      and differences cannot underflow in IEEE 754; if x
	      != y then x-y is correct to full precision and cer-
	      tainly nonzero regardless of how tiny it may be.)

MATH(3M)		      1986			 MATH(3M)



	      Products and quotients that underflow gradually can
	      lose accuracy gradually without vanishing, so com-
	      paring them with zero (as one might on a VAX) will
	      not reveal the loss.  Fortunately, if a gradually
	      underflowed value is destined to be added to some-
	      thing bigger than the underflow threshold, as is
	      almost always the case, digits lost to gradual
	      underflow will not be missed because they would
	      have been rounded off anyway.  So gradual under-
	      flows are usually _p_r_o_v_a_b_l_y ignorable.  The same
	      cannot be said of underflows flushed to 0.

	  At the option of an implementor conforming to IEEE 754,
	  other ways to cope with exceptions may be provided:

	  4)  ABORT.  This mechanism classifies an exception in
	      advance as an incident to be handled by means trad-
	      itionally associated with error-handling statements
	      like "ON ERROR GO TO ...".  Different languages
	      offer different forms of this statement, but most
	      share the following characteristics:

	  -   No means is provided to substitute a value for the
	      offending operation's result and resume computation
	      from what may be the middle of an expression.  An
	      exceptional result is abandoned.

	  -   In a subprogram that lacks an error-handling state-
	      ment, an exception causes the subprogram to abort
	      within whatever program called it, and so on back
	      up the chain of calling subprograms until an
	      error-handling statement is encountered or the
	      whole task is aborted and memory is dumped.

	  5)  STOP.  This mechanism, requiring an interactive
	      debugging environment, is more for the programmer
	      than the program.  It classifies an exception in
	      advance as a symptom of a programmer's error; the
	      exception suspends execution as near as it can to
	      the offending operation so that the programmer can
	      look around to see how it happened.  Quite often
	      the first several exceptions turn out to be quite
	      unexceptionable, so the programmer ought ideally to
	      be able to resume execution after each one as if
	      execution had not been stopped.

	  6)  ... Other ways lie beyond the scope of this docu-
	      ment.

     The crucial problem for exception handling is the problem of
     Scope, and the problem's solution is understood, but not
     enough manpower was available to implement it fully in time

     to be distributed in 4.3 BSD's _l_i_b_m.  Ideally, each elemen-
     tary function should act as if it were indivisible, or
     atomic, in the sense that ...

     i)    No exception should be signaled that is not deserved
	   by the data supplied to that function.

     ii)   Any exception signaled should be identified with that
	   function rather than with one of its subroutines.

     iii)  The internal behavior of an atomic function should not
	   be disrupted when a calling program changes from one
	   to another of the five or so ways of handling excep-
	   tions listed above, although the definition of the
	   function may be correlated intentionally with excep-
	   tion handling.

     Ideally, every programmer should be able _c_o_n_v_e_n_i_e_n_t_l_y to
     turn a debugged subprogram into one that appears atomic to
     its users.  But simulating all three characteristics of an
     atomic function is still a tedious affair, entailing hosts
     of tests and saves-restores; work is under way to ameliorate
     the inconvenience.

     Meanwhile, the functions in _l_i_b_m are only approximately
     atomic.  They signal no inappropriate exception except pos-
     sibly ...

	       when it happens to be exact, thanks to fortuitous
	       cancellation of errors.

	  Invalid Operation is signaled only when

	  Overflow is signaled only when

	       overflow threshold.
	  Divide-by-Zero is signaled only when
	       a function takes exactly infinite values at finite
	       operands.
	  Underflow is signaled only when
	       the exact result would be nonzero but tinier than
	       the underflow threshold.
	  Inexact is signaled only when
	       greater range or precision would be needed to

     An explanation of IEEE 754 and its proposed extension p854
     was published in the IEEE magazine MICRO in August 1984
     under the title "A Proposed Radix- and
     Word-length-independent Standard for Floating-point Arith-
     metic" by W. J. Cody et al.  The manuals for Pascal, C and
     BASIC on the Apple Macintosh document the features of IEEE
     754 pretty well.  Articles in the IEEE magazine COMPUTER
     vol. 14 no. 3 (Mar.  1981), and in the ACM SIGNUM Newsletter
     Special Issue of Oct. 1979, may be helpful although they
     pertain to superseded drafts of the standard.
