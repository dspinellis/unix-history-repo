     _U_n_g_e_t_c pushes the character _c back on an input stream.  That
     character will be returned by the next _g_e_t_c call on that
     stream.  _U_n_g_e_t_c returns _c.

     One character of pushback is guaranteed provided something
     has been read from the stream and the stream is actually
     buffered.	Attempts to push EOF are rejected.

     _F_s_e_e_k(3) erases all memory of pushed back characters.
