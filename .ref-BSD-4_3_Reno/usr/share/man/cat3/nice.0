     The scheduling priority of the process is augmented by _i_n_c_r.
     Positive priorities get less service than normal.	Priority
     10 is recommended to users who wish to execute long-running
     programs without flak from the administration.

     Negative increments are ignored except on behalf of the
     super-user.  The priority is limited to the range -20 (most
     urgent) to 20 (least).

     The priority of a process is passed to a child process by
     _f_o_r_k(2).  For a privileged process to return to normal
     priority from an unknown state, _n_i_c_e should be called suc-
     cessively with arguments -40 (goes to priority -20 because
     of truncation), 20 (to get to 0), then 0 (to maintain compa-
     tibility with previous versions of this call).
