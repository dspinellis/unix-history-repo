     This group of routines are provided to manipulate the Ker-
     beros tickets file.  A ticket file has the following format:

	 principal's name	   (null-terminated string)
	 principal's instance	   (null-terminated string)
	 CREDENTIAL_1
	 CREDENTIAL_2
	   ...
	 CREDENTIAL_n
	 EOF


     Where "CREDENTIAL_x" consists of the following fixed-length
     fields from the CREDENTIALS structure (defined in <kerberosIV/krb.h>):

	      char	service[ANAME_SZ]
	      char	instance[INST_SZ]
	      char	realm[REALM_SZ]
	      des_cblock     session
	      int	lifetime
	      int	kvno
	      KTEXT_ST	ticket_st
	      long	issue_date


     _t_f__i_n_i_t must be called before the other ticket file rou-
     tines.  It takes the name of the ticket file to use, and a

     read/write flag as arguments.  It tries to open the ticket
     file, checks the mode and if everything is okay, locks the
     file.  If it's opened for reading, the lock is shared.  If
     it's opened for writing, the lock is exclusive.  KSUCCESS is
     returned if all went well, otherwise one of the following:

     NO_TKT_FIL     - file wasn't there
     TKT_FIL_ACC    - file was in wrong mode, etc.
     TKT_FIL_LCK    - couldn't lock the file, even after a retry


     The _t_f__g_e_t__p_n_a_m_e reads the principal's name from a ticket
     file.  It should only be called after tf_init has been
     called.  The principal's name is filled into the _p_n_a_m_e
     parameter.  If all goes well, KSUCCESS is returned.  If
     tf_init wasn't called, TKT_FIL_INI is returned.  If the
     principal's name was null, or EOF was encountered, or the
     name was longer than ANAME_SZ, TKT_FIL_FMT is returned.

     The _t_f__g_e_t__p_i_n_s_t reads the principal's instance from a
     ticket file.  It should only be called after tf_init and
     tf_get_pname have been called.  The principal's instance is
     filled into the _p_i_n_s_t parameter.  If all goes well, KSUCCESS
     is returned.  If tf_init wasn't called, TKT_FIL_INI is
     returned.	If EOF was encountered, or the name was longer
     than INST_SZ, TKT_FIL_FMT is returned.  Note that, unlike
     the principal name, the instance name may be null.

     The _t_f__g_e_t__c_r_e_d routine reads a CREDENTIALS record from a
     ticket file and fills in the given structure.  It should
     only be called after tf_init, tf_get_pname, and tf_get_pinst
     have been called.	If all goes well, KSUCCESS is returned.
     Possible error codes are:

     TKT_FIL_INI    - tf_init wasn't called first
     TKT_FIL_FMT    - bad format
     EOF       - end of file encountered


     _t_f__c_l_o_s_e closes the ticket file and releases the lock on it.
