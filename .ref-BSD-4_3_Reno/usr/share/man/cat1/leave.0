DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     LLeeaavvee waits until the specified time, then reminds you that you have to
     leave.  You are reminded 5 minutes and 1 minute before the actual time,
     at the time, and every minute thereafter.	When you log off, lleeaavvee exits
     just before it would have printed the next message.

     Options:

     _h_h_m_m      The time of day is in the form _h_h_m_m where _h_h is a time in hours
	       (on a 12 or 24 hour clock), and _m_m are minutes.	All times are
	       converted to a 12 hour clock, and assumed to be in the next 12
	       hours.

     ++	       If the time is preceeded by `+', the alarm will go off in hours
	       and minutes from the current time.

     If no argument is given, lleeaavvee prompts with "When do you have to leave?".
     A reply of newline causes lleeaavvee to exit, otherwise the reply is assumed
     to be a time.  This form is suitable for inclusion in a ._l_o_g_i_n or
     ._p_r_o_f_i_l_e.

     Leave ignores interrupts, quits, and terminates.  To get rid of it you
     should either log off or use `kill -9' giving its process id.
