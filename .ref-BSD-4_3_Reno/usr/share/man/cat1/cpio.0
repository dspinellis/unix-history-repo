     CCppiioo has three functional modes; copy out, copy in and pass.

     Functional Options:

     --oo    Copy out - reads the standard input to obtain a list of path names
	   and copies those files onto the standard output together with path
	   name and status information.  Output is padded to a 512-byte boun-
	   dary.

     --ii    Copy in - extracts files from the standard input, which is assumed
	   to be the product of a previous ccppiioo --oo.  Only files with names
	   that match patterns are selected.  Patterns are given in the name-
	   generating notation of sh(1).  In patterns, meta-characters `?',
	   `*', and `[...]' match the slash `/' character.  Multiple patterns
	   may be specified and if no patterns are specified, the default for
	   patterns is `*' (i.e., select all files).  The extracted files are
	   conditionally created and copied into the current directory tree
	   based upon the options described below.  The permissions of the
	   files will be those of the previous ccppiioo --oo.  The owner and group
	   of the files will be that of the current user unless the user is
	   super-user, which causes ccppiioo to retain the owner and group of the
	   files of the previous ccppiioo --oo.

     --pp    Pass - reads the standard input to obtain a list of path names of
	   files that are conditionally created and copied into the destina-
	   tion directory tree based upon the options described below.

     Options for the above functional options:

     --aa    Reset access times of input files after they have been copied.

     --BB    Input/output is to be blocked 5,120 bytes to the record (does not
	   apply to the pass options; meaningful only with data directed to or
	   from /_d_e_v/_r_m_t/??).

     --dd    Directories are to be created as needed.

     --cc    Write header information in ASCII character form for portability.

     --rr    Interactively rename files.	If the user types a null line, the
	   files is skipped.

     --tt    Print a table of contents of the input.  No files are created.

     --uu    Copy unconditionally (normally, an older file will not replace a
	   newer file with the same name).

     --vv    Verbose: causes a list of file names to be printed.	When used with
	   the t option, the table of contents looks like the output of an `ls
	   -l' command (see ls(1)).

     --ll    Whenever possible, link files rather than copying them.  Usable
	   only with the --pp option.

     --mm    Retain previous file modification time.  This option is ineffective
	   on directories that are being copied.
     --ff    Copy in all files except those in patterns.

     --ss    Swap bytes.	Use only with the --ii option.

     --SS    Swap halfwords.  Use only with the --ii option.

     --bb    halfwords.  Use only with the --ii option.

     --66    Process an old (i.e., UNIX System Sixth Edition format) file.  Only
	   useful with --ii (copy in).

     The first example below copies the contents of a directory into an ar-
     chive; the second duplicates a directory hierarchy:

	   ls | cpio -o >/dev/rmt/0m

	   cd olddir
	   find . -depth -print | cpio -pdl newdir

     The trivial case

	   find . -depth -print | cpio -oB >/dev/fmt/0m

     can be handled more efficiently by:

	   find . -cpio /dev/rmt/0m

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     The ccppiioo command appeared in System V AT&T UNIX.  This program is derived
     from the System V AT&T sources which were contributed to the public
     domain by AT&T.

BBUUGGSS
     Path names are restricted to 128 characters.  If there are too many
     unique linked files, the program runs out of memory to keep track of them
     and, thereafter, linking information is lost.  Only the super-user can
     copy special files.  The --BB option does not work with certain magnetic
     tape drives.
