     rrccpp - remote file copy

     RRccpp copies files between machines.  Each _f_i_l_e or _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y argument is
     either a remote file name of the form ``rname@rhost:path'', or a local
     file name (containing no `:' characters, or a `/' before any `:'s).

     --rr        If any of the source files are directories, rrccpp copies each
	       subtree rooted at that name; in this case the destination must
	       be a directory.

     --pp        The --pp option causes rrccpp to attempt to preserve (duplicate) in
	       its copies the modification times and modes of the source
	       files, ignoring the _u_m_a_s_k.  By default, the mode and owner of
	       _f_i_l_e_2 are preserved if it already existed; otherwise the mode
	       of the source file modified by the umask(2) on the destination
	       host is used.

     --kk        The --kk option requests rrccpp to obtain tickets for the remote
	       host in realm _r_e_a_l_m instead of the remote host's realm as
	       determined by krb_realmofhost(3).

     If _p_a_t_h is not a full path name, it is interpreted relative to the login
     directory of the specified user _r_u_s_e_r on _r_h_o_s_t, or your current user name
     if no other remote user name is specified.  A _p_a_t_h on a remote host may
     be quoted (using \, ", or ') so that the metacharacters are interpreted
     remotely.

     RRccpp does not prompt for passwords; it performs remote execution via
     rsh(1), and requires the same authorization.

     RRccpp handles third party copies, where neither source nor target files are
     on the current machine.

     RRccpp appeared in 4.2 BSD.  The version of rcp described here has been
     reimplemented with Kerberos in 4.3+Reno BSD.

BBUUGGSS
     Doesn't detect all cases where the target of a copy might be a file in
     cases where only a directory should be legal.

     Is confused by any output generated by commands in a ._l_o_g_i_n, ._p_r_o_f_i_l_e, or
     ._c_s_h_r_c file on the remote host.

     The destination user and hostname may have to be specified as
     ``rhost.rname'' when the destination machine is running the 4.2BSD ver-
     sion of rrccpp.
