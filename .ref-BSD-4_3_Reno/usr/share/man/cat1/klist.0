     _k_l_i_s_t prints the name of the tickets file and the identity
     of the principal the tickets are for (as listed in the tick-
     ets file), and lists the principal names of all Kerberos
     tickets currently held by the user, along with the issue and
     expire time for each authenticator.  Principal names are
     listed in the form _n_a_m_e._i_n_s_t_a_n_c_e@_r_e_a_l_m, with the '.' omitted
     if the instance is null, and the '@' omitted if the realm is
     null.

     If given the --ss option, _k_l_i_s_t does not print the issue and
     expire times, the name of the tickets file, or the identity
     of the principal.

     If given the --tt option, kklliisstt checks for the existence of a
     non-expired ticket-granting-ticket in the ticket file.  If
     one is present, it exits with status 0, else it exits with
     status 1.	No output is generated when this option is speci-
     fied.

     If given the --ffiillee option, the following argument is used as
     the ticket file.  Otherwise, if the KKRRBBTTKKFFIILLEE environment
     variable is set, it is used.  If this environment variable
     is not set, the file //ttmmpp//ttkktt[[uuiidd]] is used, where uuiidd is the
     current user-id of the user.

     If given the --ssrrvvttaabb option, the file is treated as a ser-
     vice key file, and the names of the keys contained therein
     are printed.  If no file is specified with a --ffiillee option,
     the default is /_e_t_c/_k_e_r_b_e_r_o_s_I_V/_s_r_v_t_a_b.
