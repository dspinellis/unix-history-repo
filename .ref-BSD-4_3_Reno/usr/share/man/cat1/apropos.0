     AApprrooppooss shows which manual pages contain instances of any of the given
     _k_e_y_w_o_r_d(_s) in their title line.  Each word is considered separately and
     case of letters is ignored.  Words which are part of other words are con-
     sidered; when looking for ``compile'', aapprrooppooss will also list all in-
     stances of ``compiler''.

     If the line output by aapprrooppooss starts ``name(section) ...'' you can enter
     ``man section name'' to get its documentation.

     The options are as follows:

     --MM        Override the list of standard directories where aapprrooppooss
	       searches for a database named _w_h_a_t_i_s._d_b.  The supplied _p_a_t_h
	       must be a colon (``:'') separated list of directories.  This
	       search path may also be set using the environment variable
	       MANPATH.

     --mm        Augment the list of standard directories where aapprrooppooss searches
	       for its database.  The supplied _p_a_t_h must be a colon (``:'')
	       separated list of directories.  These directories will be
	       searched before the standard directories or the directories
	       supplied with the --MM option or the MANPATH environmental vari-
	       able are searched.

     MANPATH   The standard search path used by man(1) may be overridden by
	       specifying a path in the MANPATH environmental variable.  The
	       format of the path is a colon (``:'') separated list of direc-
	       tories.
