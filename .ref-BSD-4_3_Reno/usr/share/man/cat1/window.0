     WWiinnddooww implements a window environment on ASCII terminals.

     A window is a rectangular portion of the physical terminal screen associ-
     ated with a set of processes.  Its size and position can be changed by
     the user at any time.  Processes communicate with their window in the
     same way they normally interact with a terminal-through their standard
     input, output, and diagnostic file descriptors.  The window program han-
     dles the details of redirecting input an output to and from the windows.
     At any one time, only one window can receive input from the keyboard, but
     all windows can simultaneously send output to the display.

     When wwiinnddooww starts up, the commands (see long commands below) contained
     in the file ._w_i_n_d_o_w_r_c in the user's home directory are executed.  If it
     does not exist, two equal sized windows spanning the terminal screen are
     created by default.

     The command line options are

     --tt        Turn on terse mode (see tteerrssee command below).

     --ff        Fast.  Don't perform any startup action.

     --dd        Ignore ._w_i_n_d_o_w_r_c and create the two default windows instead.

     --ee _e_s_c_a_p_e-_c_h_a_r
	       Set the escape character to _e_s_c_a_p_e-_c_h_a_r.  _E_s_c_a_p_e-_c_h_a_r can be a
	       single character, or in the form ^^XX where _X is any character,
	       meaning control-_X.

     --cc _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
	       Execute the string _c_o_m_m_a_n_d as a long command (see below) before
	       doing anything else.

     Windows can overlap and are framed as necessary.  Each window is named by
     one of the digits ``1'' to ``9''.	This one-character identifier, as well
     as a user definable label string, are displayed with the window on the
     top edge of its frame.  A window can be designated to be in the
     _f_o_r_e_g_r_o_u_n_d, in which case it will always be on top of all normal, non-
     foreground windows, and can be covered only by other foreground windows.
     A window need not be completely within the edges of the terminal screen.
     Thus a large window (possibly larger than the screen) may be positioned
     to show only a portion of its full size.

     Each window has a cursor and a set of control functions.  Most intelli-
     gent terminal operations such as line and character deletion and inser-
     tion are supported.  Display modes such as underlining and reverse video
     are available if they are supported by the terminal.  In addition, simi-
     lar to terminals with multiple pages of memory, each window has a text
     buffer which can have more lines than the window itself.

  PPrroocceessss EEnnvviirroonnmmeenntt
     With each newly created window, a shell program is spawned with its pro-
     cess environment tailored to that window.	Its standard input, output,
     and diagnostic file descriptors are bound to one end of either a pseudo-
     terminal (pty(4)) or a UNIX domain socket (socketpair(4)).  If a pseudo-
     terminal is used, then its special characters and modes (see stty(1)) are
     copied from the physical terminal.  A termcap(5) entry tailored to this
     window is created and passed as environment (environ(5)) variable
     TERMCAP.  The termcap entry contains the window's size and characteris-
     tics as well as information from the physical terminal, such as the ex-
     istence of underline, reverse video, and other display modes, and the
     codes produced by the terminal's function keys, if any.  In addition, the
     window size attributes of the pseudo-terminal are set to reflect the size
     of this window, and updated whenever it is changed by the user.  In par-
     ticular, the editor vi(1) uses this information to redraw its display.

  OOppeerraattiioonn
     During normal execution, wwiinnddooww can be in one of two states: conversation
     mode and command mode.  In conversation mode, the terminal's real cursor
     is placed at the cursor position of a particular window--called the
     current window--and input from the keyboard is sent to the process in
     that window.  The current window is always on top of all other windows,
     except those in foreground.  In addition, it is set apart by highlighting
     its identifier and label in reverse video.

     Typing wwiinnddooww's escape character (normally ^^PP) in conversation mode
     switches it into command mode.  In command mode, the top line of the ter-
     minal screen becomes the command prompt window, and wwiinnddooww interprets in-
     put from the keyboard as commands to manipulate windows.

     There are two types of commands: short commands are usually one or two
     key strokes; long commands are strings either typed by the user in the
     command window (see the ``::'' command below), or read from a file (see
     ssoouurrccee below).

  SShhoorrtt CCoommmmaannddss
     Below, # represents one of the digits ``1'' to ``9'' corresponding to the
     windows 1 to 9.  ^^XX means control-_X, where _X is any character.  In par-
     ticular, ^^^^ is control-^.	_E_s_c_a_p_e is the escape key, or ^^[[

     #	   Select window # as the current window and return to conversation
	   mode.

     %%#    Select window # but stay in command mode.

     ^^^^    Select the previous window and return to conversation mode.	This
	   is useful for toggling between two windows.

     eessccaappee
	   Return to conversation mode.

     ^^PP    Return to conversation mode and write ^^PP to the current window.
	   Thus, typing two ^^PP's in conversation mode sends one to the current
	   window.  If the wwiinnddooww escape is changed to some other character,
	   that character takes the place of ^^PP here.

     ??	   List a short summary of commands.

     ^^LL    Refresh the screen.

     qq	   Exit wwiinnddooww.  Confirmation is requested.

     ^^ZZ    Suspend wwiinnddooww.

     ww	   Create a new window.  The user is prompted for the positions of the
	   upper left and lower right corners of the window.  The cursor is
	   placed on the screen and the keys ``h'', ``j'', ``k'', and ``l''
	   move the cursor left, down, up, and right, respectively.  The keys
	   ``H'', ``J'', ``K'', and ``L'' move the cursor to the respective
	   limits of the screen.  Typing a number before the movement keys re-
	   peats the movement that number of times.  Return enters the cursor
	   position as the upper left corner of the window.  The lower right
	   corner is entered in the same manner.  During this process, the
	   placement of the new window is indicated by a rectangular box drawn
	   on the screen, corresponding to where the new window will be
	   framed.  Typing escape at any point cancels this command.

	   This window becomes the current window, and is given the first
	   available ID.  The default buffer size is used (see _d_e_f_a_u_l_t__n_l_i_n_e
	   command below).

	   Only fully visible windows can be created this way.

     cc#    Close window #.  The process in the window is sent the hangup sig-
	   nal (see kill(1)).  Csh(1) should handle this signal correctly and
	   cause no problems.

     mm#    Move window # to another location.  A box in the shape of the win-
	   dow is drawn on the screen to indicate the new position of the win-
	   dow, and the same keys as those for the ww command are used to posi-
	   tion the box.  The window can be moved partially off-screen.

     MM#    Move window # to its previous position.

     ss#    Change the size of window #.  The user is prompted to enter the new
	   lower right corner of the window.  A box is drawn to indicate the
	   new window size.  The same keys used in ww and mm are used to enter
	   the position.

     SS#    Change window # to its previous size.

     ^^YY    Scroll the current window up by one line.

     ^^EE    Scroll the current window down by one line.

     ^^UU    Scroll the current window up by half the window size.

     ^^DD    Scroll the current window down by half the window size.

     ^^BB    Scroll the current window up by the full window size.

     ^^FF    Scroll the current window down by the full window size.

     hh	   Move the cursor of the current window left by one column.

     jj	   Move the cursor of the current window down by one line.

     kk	   Move the cursor of the current window up by one line.

     ll	   Move the cursor of the current window right by one column.

     ^^SS    Stop output in the current window.

     ^^QQ    Start output in the current window.

     :	   Enter a line to be executed as long commands.  Normal line editing
	   characters (erase character, erase word, erase line) are supported.

  LLoonngg CCoommmmaannddss
     Long commands are a sequence of statements parsed much like a programming
     language, with a syntax similar to that of C.  Numeric and string expres-
     sions and variables are supported, as well as conditional statements.

     There are two data types: string and number.  A string is a sequence of
     letters or digits beginning with a letter.  ``_'' and ``.'' are con-
     sidered letters.  Alternately, non-alphanumeric characters can be includ-
     ed in strings by quoting them in ``"'' or escaping them with ``\''.  In
     addition, the ``\'' sequences of C are supported, both inside and outside
     quotes (e.g., ``\n'' is a new line, ``\r'' a carriage return).  For exam-
     ple, these are legal strings: abcde01234, "&#$^*&#", ab"$#"cd, ab\$\#cd,
     "/usr/ucb/window".

     A number is an integer value in one of three forms: a decimal number, an
     octal number preceded by ``0'', or a hexadecimal number preceded by
     ``0x'' or ``0X''.	The natural machine integer size is used (i.e., the
     signed integer type of the C compiler).  As in C, a non-zero number
     represents a boolean true.

     The character ``#'' begins a comment which terminates at the end of the
     line.

     A statement is either a conditional or an expression.  Expression state-
     ments are terminated with a new line or ``;''.  To continue an expression
     on the next line, terminate the first line with ``\''.

     WWiinnddooww has a single control structure: the fully bracketed if statement
     in the form

	   if <expr> then
	   <statement>
	   ...
	   elsif <expr> then
	   <statement>
	   ...
	   else
	   <statement>
	   ...
	   endif

     The eellssee and eellssiiff parts are optional, and the latter can be repeated any
     number of times.  <Expr> must be numeric.

  EExxpprreessssiioonnss
     Expressions in wwiinnddooww are similar to those in the C language, with most C
     operators supported on numeric operands.  In addition, some are overload-
     ed to operate on strings.

     When an expression is used as a statement, its value is discarded after
     evaluation.  Therefore, only expressions with side effects (assignments
     and function calls) are useful as statements.

     Single valued (no arrays) variables are supported, of both numeric and
     string values.  Some variables are predefined.  They are listed below.

     The operators in order of increasing precedence:

     <_e_x_p_r_1> == <_e_x_p_r_2>
	       Assignment.  The variable of name <_e_x_p_r_1>, which must be string
	       valued, is assigned the result of <_e_x_p_r_2>.  Returns the value
	       of <_e_x_p_r_2>.

     <_e_x_p_r_1> ?? <_e_x_p_r_2> : <_e_x_p_r_3>
	       Returns the value of <_e_x_p_r_2> if <_e_x_p_r_1> evaluates true (non-
	       zero numeric value); returns the value of <_e_x_p_r_3> otherwise.
	       Only one of <_e_x_p_r_2> and <_e_x_p_r_3> is evaluated.  <_E_x_p_r_1> must be
	       numeric.

     <_e_x_p_r_1> |||| <_e_x_p_r_2>
	       Logical or.  Numeric values only.  Short circuit evaluation is
	       supported (i.e., if <_e_x_p_r_1> evaluates true, then <_e_x_p_r_2> is not
	       evaluated).

     <_e_x_p_r_1> &&&& <_e_x_p_r_2>
	       Logical and with short circuit evaluation.  Numeric values
	       only.
     <_e_x_p_r_1> || <_e_x_p_r_2>
	       Bitwise or.  Numeric values only.

     <_e_x_p_r_1> ^^ <_e_x_p_r_2>
	       Bitwise exclusive or.  Numeric values only.

     <_e_x_p_r_1> && <_e_x_p_r_2>
	       Bitwise and.  Numeric values only.

     <_e_x_p_r_1> == <_e_x_p_r_2>, _e_x_p_r_1> !!== <_e_x_p_r_2>
	       Comparison (equal and not equal, respectively).	The boolean
	       result (either 1 or 0) of the comparison is returned.  The
	       operands can be numeric or string valued.  One string operand
	       forces the other to be converted to a string in necessary.

     <_e_x_p_r_1> << <_e_x_p_r_2>, _e_x_p_r_1> >> <_e_x_p_r_2>, _e_x_p_r_1> <<== <_e_x_p_r_2>,
	       Less than, greater than, less than or equal to, greater than or
	       equal to.  Both numeric and string values, with automatic
	       conversion as above.

     <_e_x_p_r_1> <<<< <_e_x_p_r_2>, _e_x_p_r_1> >>>> <_e_x_p_r_2>
	       If both operands are numbers, <_e_x_p_r_1> is bit shifted left (or
	       right) by <_e_x_p_r_2> bits.	If <_e_x_p_r_1> is a string, then its first
	       (or last) <_e_x_p_r_2> characters are returns (if <_e_x_p_r_2> is also a
	       string, then its length is used in place of its value).

     <_e_x_p_r_1> ++ <_e_x_p_r_2>, _e_x_p_r_1> -- <_e_x_p_r_2>
	       Addition and subtraction on numbers.  For ``+'', if one
	       argument is a string, then the other is converted to a string,
	       and the result is the concatenation of the two strings.

     <_e_x_p_r_1> ** <_e_x_p_r_2>, <_e_x_p_r_1> // <_e_x_p_r_2>, <_e_x_p_r_1>, <_e_x_p_r_1> %% <_e_x_p_r_2>
	       Multiplication, division, modulo.  Numbers only.

     <_e_x_p_r>, ~~<_e_x_p_r>, !!<_e_x_p_r>, $$<_e_x_p_r>, $$??<_e_x_p_r>
	       The first three are unary minus, bitwise complement and logical
	       complement on numbers only.  The operator, ``$'', takes <_e_x_p_r>
	       and returns the value of the variable of that name.  If <_e_x_p_r>
	       is numeric with value _n and it appears within an alias macro
	       (see below), then it refers to the nth argument of the alias
	       invocation.  ``$?'' tests for the existence of the variable
	       <_e_x_p_r>, and returns 1 if it exists or 0 otherwise.

     <_e_x_p_r>(<_a_r_g_l_i_s_t>)
	       Function call.  <_E_x_p_r> must be a string that is the unique
	       prefix of the name of a builtin wwiinnddooww function or the full
	       name of a user defined alias macro.  In the case of a builtin
	       function, <_a_r_g_l_i_s_t> can be in one of two forms:
		     <expr1>, <expr2>, ...
		     argname1 = <expr1>, argname2 = <expr2>, ...
	       The two forms can in fact be intermixed, but the result is
	       unpredictable.  Most arguments can be omitted; default values
	       will be supplied for them.  The _a_r_g_n_a_m_e_s can be unique prefixes
	       of the the argument names.  The commas separating arguments are
	       used only to disambiguate, and can usually be omitted.

	       Only the first argument form is valid for user defined aliases.
	       Aliases are defined using the aalliiaass builtin function (see
	       below).	Arguments are accessed via a variant of the variable
	       mechanism (see ``$'' operator above).

	       Most functions return value, but some are used for side effect
	       only and so must be used as statements.	When a function or an
	       alias is used as a statement, the parenthesis surrounding the
	       argument list may be omitted.  Aliases return no value.

  BBuuiillttiinn FFuunnccttiioonnss
     The arguments are listed by name in their natural order.  Optional argu-
     ments are in square brackets `[]'.  Arguments that have no names are in
     angle brackets `<>'.  An argument meant to be a boolean flag (often named
     _f_l_a_g) can be one of _o_n, _o_f_f, _y_e_s, _n_o, _t_r_u_e, or _f_a_l_s_e, with obvious mean-
     ings, or it can be a numeric expression, in which case a non-zero value
     is true.

     aalliiaass([<_s_t_r_i_n_g]>, [<_s_t_r_i_n_g-_l_i_s_t>])
	       If no argument is given, all currently defined alias macros are
	       listed.	Otherwise, <_s_t_r_i_n_g> is defined as an alias, with
	       expansion <_s_t_r_i_n_g-_l_i_s_t>.  The previous definition of <_s_t_r_i_n_g>,
	       if any, is returned.  Default for <_s_t_r_i_n_g-_l_i_s_t> is no change.

     cclloossee(<_w_i_n_d_o_w-_l_i_s_t>)
	       Close the windows specified in <_w_i_n_d_o_w-_l_i_s_t>.  If <_w_i_n_d_o_w-_l_i_s_t>
	       is the word _a_l_l, than all windows are closed.  No value is re-
	       turned.

     ccuurrssoorrmmooddeess([_m_o_d_e_s])
	       Set the window cursor to _m_o_d_e_s.	_M_o_d_e_s is the bitwise or of the
	       mode bits defined as the variables _m__u_l (underline), _m__r_e_v (re-
	       verse video), _m__b_l_k (blinking), and _m__g_r_p (graphics, terminal
	       dependent).  Return value is the previous modes.  Default is no
	       change.	For example, cursor($m_rev$m_blk) sets the window cur-
	       sors to blinking reverse video.

     ddeeffaauulltt__nnlliinnee([_n_l_i_n_e])
	       Set the default buffer size to _n_l_i_n_e.  Initially, it is 48
	       lines.  Returns the old default buffer size.  Default is no
	       change.	Using a very large buffer can slow the program down
	       considerably.

     ddeeffaauulltt__sshheellll([<_s_t_r_i_n_g-_l_i_s_t>])
	       Set the default window shell program to <_s_t_r_i_n_g-_l_i_s_t>.  Returns
	       the first string in the old shell setting.  Default is no
	       change.	Initially, the default shell is taken from the
	       environment variable SHELL.

     ddeeffaauulltt__ssmmooootthh([_f_l_a_g])
	       Set the default value of the _s_m_o_o_t_h argument to the command
	       wwiinnddooww (see below).  The argument is a boolean flag (one of _o_n,
	       _o_f_f, _y_e_s, _n_o, _t_r_u_e, _f_a_l_s_e, or a number, as described above).
	       Default is no change.  The old value (as a number) is returned.
	       The initial value is 1 (true).

     eecchhoo([_w_i_n_d_o_w], [<_s_t_r_i_n_g-_l_i_s_t>])
	       Write the list of strings, <_s_t_r_i_n_g-_l_i_s_t>, to wwiinnddooww, separated
	       by spaces and terminated with a new line.  The strings are only
	       displayed in the window, the processes in the window are not
	       involved (see wwrriittee below).  No value is returned.  Default is
	       the current window.

     eessccaappee([_e_s_c_a_p_e_c])
	       Set the escape character to _e_s_c_a_p_e-_c_h_a_r.  Returns the old es-
	       cape character as a one-character string.  Default is no
	       change.	_E_s_c_a_p_e_c can be a string of a single character, or in
	       the form --^^XX, meaning Cx control- _X .

     ffoorreeggrroouunndd([_w_i_n_d_o_w],[_f_l_a_g])
	       Move wwiinnddooww in or out of foreground.  _F_l_a_g is a boolean value.
	       The old foreground flag is returned.  Default for wwiinnddooww is the
	       current window, default for _f_l_a_g is no change.

     llaabbeell([_w_i_n_d_o_w],[_l_a_b_e_l])
	       Set the label of wwiinnddooww to _l_a_b_e_l.  Returns the old label as a
	       string.	Default for wwiinnddooww is the current window, default for
	       _l_a_b_e_l is no change.  To turn off a label, set it to an empty
	       string ("").

     lliisstt()    No arguments.  List the identifiers and labels of all windows.
	       No value is returned.

     sseelleecctt([_w_i_n_d_o_w])
	       Make wwiinnddooww the current window.	The previous current window is
	       returned.  Default is no change.

     ssoouurrccee(_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e)
	       Read and execute the long commands in _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.	Returns -1 if
	       the file cannot be read, 0 otherwise.

     tteerrssee([flag])
	       Set terse mode to _f_l_a_g.	In terse mode, the command window
	       stays hidden even in command mode, and errors are reported by
	       sounding the terminal's bell.  _F_l_a_g can take on the same values
	       as in _f_o_r_e_g_r_o_u_n_d above.	Returns the old terse flag.  Default
	       is no change.

     uunnaalliiaass(_a_l_i_a_s)
	       Undefine _a_l_i_a_s.	Returns -1 if _a_l_i_a_s does not exist, 0 other-
	       wise.

     uunnsseett(_v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e)
	       Undefine _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e.  Returns -1 if _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e does not exist, 0
	       otherwise.

     vvaarriiaabblleess()
	       No arguments.  List all variables.  No value is returned.

     wwiinnddooww([_r_o_w], [_c_o_l_u_m_n], [_n_r_o_w], [_n_c_o_l], [_n_l_i_n_e], [_l_a_b_e_l], [_p_t_y],
	       [_f_r_a_m_e] , [_m_a_p_n_l], [_k_e_e_p_o_p_e_n], [_s_m_o_o_t_h], [_s_h_e_l_l]).  Open a
	       window with upper left corner at _r_o_w, _c_o_l_u_m_n and size _n_r_o_w,
	       _n_c_o_l.  If _n_l_i_n_e is specified, then that many lines are allocat-
	       ed for the text buffer.	Otherwise, the default buffer size is
	       used.  Default values for _r_o_w, _c_o_l_u_m_n, _n_r_o_w, and _n_c_o_l are,
	       respectively, the upper, left-most, lower, or right-most ex-
	       tremes of the screen.  _L_a_b_e_l is the label string.  _F_r_a_m_e, _p_t_y,
	       and _m_a_p_n_l are flag values interpreted in the same way as the
	       argument to _f_o_r_e_g_r_o_u_n_d (see above); they mean, respectively,
	       put a frame around this window (default true), allocate
	       pseudo-terminal for this window rather than socketpair (default
	       true), and map new line characters in this window to carriage
	       return and line feed (default true if socketpair is used, false
	       otherwise).  Normally, a window is automatically closed when
	       its process exits.  Setting _k_e_e_p_o_p_e_n to true (default false)
	       prevents this action.  When _s_m_o_o_t_h is true, the screen is up-
	       dated more frequently (for this window) to produce a more
	       terminal-like behavior.	The default value of _s_m_o_o_t_h is set by
	       the _d_e_f_a_u_l_t__s_m_o_o_t_h command (see above).	_S_h_e_l_l is a list of
	       strings that will be used as the shell program to place in the
	       window (default is the program specified by _d_e_f_a_u_l_t__s_h_e_l_l, see
	       above).	The created window's identifier is returned as a
	       number.

     wwrriittee([_w_i_n_d_o_w], [<_s_t_r_i_n_g-_l_i_s_t>])
	       Send the list of strings, <_s_t_r_i_n_g-_l_i_s_t>, to wwiinnddooww, separated
	       by spaces but not terminated with a new line.  The strings are
	       actually given to the window as input.  No value is returned.
	       Default is the current window.
