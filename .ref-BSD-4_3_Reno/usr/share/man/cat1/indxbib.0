     IInnddxxbbiibb builds an inverted index to the named _d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e_s (or files), which
     can then be used by llooookkbbiibb and refer(1).	The files are assumed to be
     refer style bibliographic databases (see addbib(1)).

     IInnddxxbbiibb is a shell script which calls mmkkeeyy and iinnvv.  The first program,
     mmkkeeyy, truncates words to 6 characters, and maps upper case to lower case.
     It also discards words shorter than 3 characters, words among the 100
     most common English words, and numbers (dates) < 1900 or > 2000.  These
     parameters can be changed; see page 4 of a _R_e_f_e_r document by Mike Lesk
     (See the SEE ALSO section below).	The second program, iinnvv, creates an
     entry file (_f_i_l_e.ia), a posting file (_f_i_l_e.ib), and a tag file (_f_i_l_e.ic),
     all in the working directory.

     LLooookkbbiibb uses an inverted index made by iinnddxxbbiibb to find sets of biblio-
     graphic references.  It reads keywords typed after the ``>'' prompt on
     the terminal, and retrieves records containing all these keywords.  If
     nothing matches, nothing is returned except another ``>'' prompt.

     LLooookkbbiibb will ask if you need instructions, and will print some brief in-
     formation if you reply ``y''.  The --nn flag turns off the prompt for in-
     structions.

     It is possible to search multiple databases, as long as they have a com-
     mon index made by iinnddxxbbiibb.  In that case, only the first argument given
     to iinnddxxbbiibb is specified to llooookkbbiibb.

     If llooookkbbiibb does not find the index files (the (_f_i_l_e.i[abc] files), it
     looks for a reference file with the same name as the argument, without
     the suffixes.  It creates a file with a `.ig' suffix, suitable for use
     with fgrep(1).  It then uses this fgrep file to find references.  This
     method is simpler to use, but the _f_i_l_e.ig is slower to use than the
     _f_i_l_e.i[abc] files, and does not allow the use of multiple reference
     files.

     More than one blank line in between citations can wreak havoc.

     Probably all dates should be indexed, since many disciplines refer to
     literature written in the 1800s or earlier.
