     _V_a_c_a_t_i_o_n returns a message to the sender of a message tel-
     ling them that you are currently not reading your mail.  The
     intended use is in a ._f_o_r_w_a_r_d file.  For example, your ._f_o_r_-
     _w_a_r_d file might have:

	  \eric, "|/usr/bin/vacation -a allman eric"

     which would send messages to you (assuming your login name
     was eric) and reply to any messages for ``eric'' or ``all-
     man''.

     No message will be sent unless _l_o_g_i_n (or an _a_l_i_a_s supplied
     using the --aa option) is part of either the ``To:'' or
     ``Cc:'' headers of the mail.  No messages from ``???-
     REQUEST'', ``Postmaster'', ``UUCP'', ``MAILER'', or
     ``MAILER-DAEMON'' will be replied to (where these strings
     are case insensitive) nor is a notification sent if a ``Pre-
     cedence: bulk'' or ``Precedence: junk'' line is included in
     the mail headers.	The people who have sent you messages are
     maintained as an _n_d_b_m(3) database in the files ._v_a_c_a_t_i_o_n._p_a_g
     and ._v_a_c_a_t_i_o_n._d_i_r in your home directory.

     The --ii flag initializes the vacation database files.  It
     should be used before you modify your ._f_o_r_w_a_r_d file.

     The --rr flag sets the reply interval to _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l days.  The
     default is one week.  An interval of ``0'' means that a
     reply is sent to each message, and an interval of ``infin-
     ite'' (actually, any non-numeric character) will never send
     more than one reply.  It should be noted that intervals of
     ``0'' are quite dangerous, as it allows mailers to get into
     ``I am on vacation'' loops.

     _V_a_c_a_t_i_o_n expects a file ._v_a_c_a_t_i_o_n._m_s_g, in your home direc-
     tory, containing a message to be sent back to each sender.
     It should be an entire message (including headers).  For
     example, it might contain:

	  From: eric@ucbmonet.Berkeley.EDU (Eric Allman)
	  Subject: I am on vacation
	  Delivered-By-The-Graces-Of: The Vacation program
	  Precedence: bulk

	  I am on vacation until July 22.  If you have something urgent,

     _V_a_c_a_t_i_o_n reads the first line from the standard input for a
     UNIX-style ``From'' line to determine the sender.	_S_e_n_d_-
     _m_a_i_l(8) includes this ``From'' line automatically.

     Fatal errors, such as calling _v_a_c_a_t_i_o_n with incorrect argu-
     ments, or with non-existent _l_o_g_i_ns, are logged in the system
     log file, using _s_y_s_l_o_g(8).
