     The _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y utility destroys the user's active Kerberos
     authorization tickets by writing zeros to the file that con-
     tains them.  If the ticket file does not exist, _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y
     displays a message to that effect.

     After overwriting the file, _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y removes the file from
     the system.  The utility displays a message indicating the
     success or failure of the operation.  If _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y is unable
     to destroy the ticket file, the utility will warn you by
     making your terminal beep.

     In the Athena workstation environment, the _t_o_e_h_o_l_d service
     automatically destroys your tickets when you end a worksta-
     tion session.  If your site does not provide a similar
     ticket-destroying mechanism, you can place the _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y com-
     mand in your ._l_o_g_o_u_t file so that your tickets are destroyed
     automatically when you logout.

     The options to _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y are as follows:

     --ff     _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y runs without displaying the status message.

     --qq     _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y will not make your terminal beep if it fails
	    to destroy the tickets.

     Only the tickets in the user's current ticket file are des-
     troyed.  Separate ticket files are used to hold root
     instance and password changing tickets.  These files should
     probably be destroyed too, or all of a user's tickets kept
     in a single ticket file.
