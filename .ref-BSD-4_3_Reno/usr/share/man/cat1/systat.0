     SSyyssttaatt displays various system statistics in a screen oriented fashion
     using the curses screen display library, curses(3).

     While ssyyssttaatt is running the screen is usually divided into two windows
     (an exception is the vmstat display which uses the entire screen).  The
     upper window depicts the current system load average.  The information
     displayed in the lower window may vary, depending on user commands.  The
     last line on the screen is reserved for user input and error messages.

     By default ssyyssttaatt displays the processes getting the largest percentage
     of the processor in the lower window.  Other displays show swap space
     usage, disk i/o statistics (a la iostat(1)), virtual memory statistics (a
     la vmstat(1)), network ``mbuf'' utilization, and network connections (a
     la netstat(1)).

     Input is interpreted at two different levels.  A ``global'' command in-
     terpreter processes all keyboard input.  If this command interpreter
     fails to recognize a command, the input line is passed to a per-display
     command interpreter.  This allows each display to have certain display-
     specific commands.

     Command line options:

     --_d_i_s_p_l_a_y		The -- flag expects _d_i_s_p_l_a_y to be one of: ppiiggss, iioossttaatt,
			sswwaapp, mmbbuuffss, vvmmssttaatt or nneettssttaatt.  These displays can
			also be requested interactively (without the ``--'')
			and are described in full detail below.

     _r_e_f_r_e_s_h-_i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l	The _r_e_f_r_e_s_h-_v_a_l_u_e specifies the screen refresh time
			interval in seconds.

     Certain characters cause immediate action by ssyyssttaatt.  These are

     ^^LL        Refresh the screen.

     ^^GG        Print the name of the current ``display'' being shown in the
	       lower window and the refresh interval.

     ^^ZZ        Stop ssyyssttaatt.

     ::	       Move the cursor to the command line and interpret the input
	       line typed as a command.  While entering a command the current
	       character erase, word erase, and line kill characters may be
	       used.

	       The following commands are interpreted by the ``global'' com-
	       mand interpreter.

     hheellpp      Print the names of the available displays on the command line.

     llooaadd      Print the load average over the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes on
	       the command line.

     ssttoopp      Stop refreshing the screen.

     [ssttaarrtt] [_n_u_m_b_e_r]
	       Start (continue) refreshing the screen.	If a second, numeric,
	       argument is provided it is interpreted as a refresh interval
	       (in seconds).  Supplying only a number will set the refresh
	       interval to this value.

     qquuiitt      Exit ssyyssttaatt.  (This may be abbreviated to qq.)

     The available displays are:

     ppiiggss      Display, in the lower window, those processes resident in main
	       memory and getting the largest portion of the processor (the
	       default display).  When less than 100% of the processor is
	       scheduled to user processes, the remaining time is accounted to
	       the ``idle'' process.

     iioossttaatt    Display, in the lower window, statistics about processor use
	       and disk throughput.  Statistics on processor use appear as bar
	       graphs of the amount of time executing in user mode (``user''),
	       in user mode running low priority processes (``nice''), in sys-
	       tem mode (``system''), and idle (``idle'').  Statistics on disk
	       throughput show, for each drive, kilobytes of data transferred,
	       number of disk transactions performed, and average seek time
	       (in milliseconds).  This information may be displayed as bar
	       graphs or as rows of numbers which scroll downward.  Bar graphs
	       are shown by default;

	       The following commands are specific to the iioossttaatt display; the
	       minimum unambiguous prefix may be supplied.

		     nnuummbbeerrss   Show the disk i/o statistics in numeric form.
			       Values are displayed in numeric columns which
			       scroll downward.
		     bbaarrss      Show the disk i/o statistics in bar graph form
			       (default).
		     mmssppss      Toggle the display of average seek time (the
			       default is to not display seek times).


     sswwaapp      Display, in the lower window, swap space in use on each swap
	       device configured.  Two sets of bar graphs are shown.  The
	       upper graph displays swap space allocated to pure text segments
	       (code), the lower graph displays space allocated to stack and
	       data segments.  Allocated space is sorted by its size into
	       buckets of size dmmin, dmmin*2, dmmin*4, up to dmmax (to re-
	       flect allocation policies imposed by the system).  The disk
	       segment size, in sectors, is displayed along the left hand side
	       of the text, and data and stack graphs.	Space allocated to the
	       user structure and page tables is not currently accounted for.

     mmbbuuffss     Display, in the lower window, the number of mbufs allocated for
	       particular uses, i.e. data, socket structures, etc.

     vvmmssttaatt    Take over the entire display and show a (rather crowded) com-
	       pendium of statistics related to virtual memory usage, process
	       scheduling, device interrupts, system name translation cache-
	       ing, disk i/o, etc.

	       The upper left quadrant of the screen shows the number of users
	       logged in and the load average over the last one, five, and
	       fifteen minute intervals.  Below this line are statistics on
	       memory utilization.  The first row of the table reports memory
	       usage only among active processes, that is processes that have
	       run in the previous twenty seconds.  The second row reports on
	       memory usage of all processes.  The first column reports on the
	       number of physical pages claimed by processes.  The second
	       column reports the number of physical pages that are devoted to
	       read only text pages.  The third and fourth columns report the
	       same two figures for virtual pages, that is the number of pages
	       that would be needed if all processes had all of their pages.
	       Finally the last column shows the number of physical pages on
	       the free list.

	       Below the memory display is the disk usage display.  It reports
	       the number of seeks, transfers, and number of kilobyte blocks
	       transferred per second averaged over the refresh period of the
	       display (by default, five seconds).  For some disks it also re-
	       ports the average milliseconds per seek.  Note that the system
	       only keeps statistics on at most four disks.

	       Below the disk display is a list of the average number of
	       processes (over the last refresh interval) that are runnable
	       (`r'), in page wait (`p'), in disk wait other than paging
	       (`d'), sleeping (`s'), and swapped out but desiring to run
	       (`w').  Below the queue length listing is a numerical listing
	       and a bar graph showing the amount of system (shown as `='),
	       user (shown as `>'), nice (shown as `-'), and idle time (shown
	       as ` ').

	       At the bottom left are statistics on name translations.	It
	       lists the number of names translated in the previous interval,
	       the number and percentage of the translations that were handled
	       by the system wide name translation cache, and the number and
	       percentage of the translations that were handled by the per
	       process name translation cache.

	       Under the date in the upper right hand quadrant are statistics
	       on paging and swapping activity.  The first two columns report
	       the average number of pages brought in and out per second over
	       the last refresh interval due to page faults and the paging
	       daemon.	The third and fourth columns report the average number
	       of pages brought in and out per second over the last refresh
	       interval due to swap requests initiated by the scheduler.  The
	       first row of the display shows the average number of disk
	       transfers per second over the last refresh interval; the second
	       row of the display shows the average number of pages
	       transferred per second over the last refresh interval.

	       Below the paging statistics is a line listing the average
	       number of total reclaims ('Rec'), intransit blocking page
	       faults (`It'), swap text pages found in free list (`F/S'), file
	       system text pages found in free list (`F/F'), reclaims from
	       free list (`RFL'), pages freed by the clock daemon (`Fre'), and
	       sequential process pages freed (`SFr') per second over the re-
	       fresh interval.

	       Below this line are statistics on the average number of zero
	       filled pages (`zf') and demand filled text pages (`xf') per
	       second over the refresh period.	The first row indicates the
	       number of requests that were resolved, the second row shows the
	       number that were set up, and the last row shows the percentage
	       of setup requests were actually used.  Note that this percen-
	       tage is usually less than 100%, however it may exceed 100% if a
	       large number of requests are actually used long after they were
	       set up during a period when no new pages are being set up.
	       Thus this figure is most interesting when observed over a long
	       time period, such as from boot time (see below on getting such
	       a display).

	       Below the page fill statistics is a column that lists the aver-
	       age number of context switches (`Csw'), traps (`Trp'; includes
	       page faults), system calls (`Sys'), interrupts (`Int'), charac-
	       ters output to DZ ports using pseudo-DMA (`Pdm'), network
	       software interrupts (`Sof'), page faults (`Flt'), pages scanned
	       by the page daemon (`Scn'), and revolutions of the page
	       daemon's hand (`Rev') per second over the refresh interval.

	       Running down the right hand side of the display is a breakdown
	       of the interrupts being handled by the system.  At the top of
	       the list is the total interrupts per second over the time in-
	       terval.	The rest of the column breaks down the total on a dev-
	       ice by device basis.  Only devices that have interrupted at
	       least once since boot time are shown.

	       The following commands are specific to the vvmmssttaatt display; the
	       minimum unambiguous prefix may be supplied.

		     bboooott      Display cumulative statistics since the system
			       was booted.
		     rruunn       Display statistics as a running total from the
			       point this command is given.
		     ttiimmee      Display statistics averaged over the refresh
			       interval (the default).
		     zzeerroo      Reset running statistics to zero.


     nneettssttaatt   Display, in the lower window, network connections.  By default,
	       network servers awaiting requests are not displayed.  Each ad-
	       dress is displayed in the format ``host.port'', with each shown
	       symbolically, when possible.  It is possible to have addresses
	       displayed numerically, limit the display to a set of ports,
	       hosts, and/or protocols (the minimum unambiguous prefix may be
	       supplied):

		     aallll	 Toggle the displaying of server processes
				 awaiting requests (this is the equivalent of
				 the --aa flag to _n_e_t_s_t_a_t _1).
		     nnuummbbeerrss	 Display network addresses numerically.
		     nnaammeess	 Display network addresses symbolically.
		     _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l	 Display only network connections using the
				 indicated protocol (currently either ``tcp''
				 or ``udp'').
		     iiggnnoorree [_i_t_e_m_s]
				 Do not display information about connections
				 associated with the specified hosts or ports.
				 Hosts and ports may be specified by name
				 (``ucbmonet'', ``ftp''), or numerically.
				 Host addresses use the Internet dot notation
				 (``128.32.0.9'').  Multiple items may be
				 specified with a single command by separating
				 them with spaces.
		     ddiissppllaayy [_i_t_e_m_s]
				 Display information about the connections
				 associated with the specified hosts or ports.
				 As for _i_g_n_o_r_e, [_i_t_e_m_s] may be names or
				 numbers.
		     sshhooww [_p_o_r_t_s|_h_o_s_t_s]
				 Show, on the command line, the currently
				 selected protocols, hosts, and ports.	Hosts
				 and ports which are being ignored are
				 prefixed with a `!'.  If _p_o_r_t_s or _h_o_s_t_s is
				 supplied as an argument to sshhooww, then only
				 the requested information will be displayed.
		     rreesseett	 Reset the port, host, and protocol matching
				 mechanisms to the default (any protocol,
				 port, or host).


     Commands to switch between displays may be abbreviated to the minimum
     unambiguous prefix; for example, ``io'' for ``iostat''.  Certain informa-
     tion may be discarded when the screen size is insufficient for display.
     For example, on a machine with 10 drives the iioossttaatt bar graph displays
     only 3 drives on a 24 line terminal.  When a bar graph would overflow the
     allotted screen space it is truncated and the actual value is printed
     ``over top'' of the bar.

     The following commands are common to each display which shows information
     about disk drives.  These commands are used to select a set of drives to
     report on, should your system have more drives configured than can nor-
     mally be displayed on the screen.

	   iiggnnoorree [_d_r_i_v_e_s]	 Do not display information about the drives
				 indicated.  Multiple drives may be specified,
				 separated by spaces.
	   ddiissppllaayy [_d_r_i_v_e_s]	 Display information about the drives
				 indicated.  Multiple drives may be specified,
				 separated by spaces.

AAUUTTHHOORR
     The unknown hacker.  The ppiiggss display is derived from a program of the
     same name written by Bill Reeves.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     ssyyssttaatt appeared in 4.3 BSD.

BBUUGGSS
     Takes 2-10 percent of the cpu.  Certain displays presume a 24 line by 80
     character terminal.  The swap space display should account for space al-
     located to the user structure and page tables.  The vvmmssttaatt display looks
     out of place because it is (it was added in as a separate display rather
     than create a new program).

     The whole thing is pretty hokey and was included in the distribution
     under serious duress.
