     MMttrreeee compares a directory hierarchy against a specification for a direc-
     tory hierarchy.  By default, the specification is read from the standard
     input.  MMttrreeee verifies that the tree rooted in the current directory
     matches the specification.

     Messages are written to standard output for any files whose characteris-
     tics do not match those of the specification, or which are missing from
     either the specification or the tree.

     The options are as follows:

     --cc        Print a specification for the tree to standard output.

     --dd        Ignore everything except directory type files.

     --ee        Don't object to files that are in the tree but not in the
	       specification.

     --ff        Read the specification from _f_i_l_e, instead of from standard in-
	       put.

     --pp        Traverse the tree rooted in _p_a_t_h, instead of the current direc-
	       tory.

     --rr        Remove any files in the tree that are not described in the
	       specification.

     --uu        Modify the owner, group, and permissions of existing files to
	       match the specification, as well as create any missing direc-
	       tories.	Owner, group, and permissions must all be specified
	       for missing directories to be created.

     --xx        Don't descend below any mount points.

     Specifications are mostly composed of ``keywords'', i.e. strings that
     that specify values relating to files.  No keywords have default values,
     and if a keyword has no set value no checks based on it are performed.

     Currently supported keywords are as follows:

     cckkssuumm     The checksum of the file using the algorithm specified by the
	       program cksum(1).

     iiggnnoorree    Causes the hierarchy below the file to be ignored.

     ggrroouupp     The group of the file; may be either numeric or symbolic.

     mmooddee      The current file's permissions as an absolute (octal) or sym-
	       bolic value (see chmod(1)).

     nnlliinnkk     The number of hard links the file is expected to have.

     oowwnneerr     The owner of the file; may be either numeric or symbolic.

     ssiizzee      The size, in bytes, of the file.

     lliinnkk      The file a symbolic link is expected to reference.
     ttiimmee      The last modification time of the file.

     ttyyppee      The type of the file; may be set to any one of the following:

	       bblloocckk	 block special device

	       cchhaarr	 character special device

	       ddiirr	 directory

	       ffiiffoo	 fifo

	       ffiillee	 regular file

	       lliinnkk	 symbolic link

	       ssoocckkeett	 socket

     There are four types of lines in a specification.

     The first type of line sets a ``global'' value for a keyword, and con-
     sists of a leading ``/set'' followed by whitespace, followed by sets of
     keyword/value pairs, separated by whitespace.  Keyword/value pairs con-
     sist of a keyword, followed by a equals sign (``=''), followed by a
     value, without intervening whitespace.  Once a keyword has been set, its
     value remains unchanged until either set again or unset.

     The second type of line unsets keywords and consists of a leading ``/un-
     set'', followed by whitespace, followed by one or more keywords, separat-
     ed by whitespace.

     The third type of line is a file specification and consists of a file
     name, followed by whitespace, followed by zero or more whitespace
     separated keyword/value pairs.  The file name may be preceded by any
     number of whitespace characters.  The file name may contain any of the
     standard file name matching characters (``['', ``]'', ``?'' or ``*''), in
     which case files in the hierarchy will be associated with the first pat-
     tern that they match.

     Each of the keyword/value pairs consist of a keyword, followed by an
     equals sign (``=''), followed by the keyword's value, without intervening
     whitespace.  These values override, without changing, the global value of
     the corresponding keyword.

     All paths are relative.  Specifying a directory will cause subsequent
     files to be searched for in that directory hierarchy.  Which brings us to
     the last type of line in a specification: a line containing only the
     string ``....'' causes the current directory path to ascend one level.

     Empty lines and lines whose first non-whitespace character is a hash mark
     (``#'') are ignored.

     MMttrreeee exits with a status of 0 on success and >0 if an error occurred or
     the tree did not match the specification.

     The cckkssuumm keyword is not yet implemented.

     The ttiimmee keyword should be specifiable in human readable terms.
