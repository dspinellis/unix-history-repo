     ddff - display free disk space

     ddff [--iikknn] [_f_i_l_e | _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m ...]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     DDff displays statistics about the amount of free disk space on the
     filesystem _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m or on the filesystem of which _f_i_l_e is a part.  If
     neither a file or a filesystem argument is given, statistics for every
     filesystem mounted is displayed.

     The following options are available:

     --ii    Include statistics on the number of free inodes.

     --kk    By default, all reported numbers are in 512-byte blocks.  This
	   causes the numbers to be reported in kilobytes.

     --nn    Print out the previously obtained statistics from the filesystems.
	   This option should be used if it is possible that one or more
	   filesystems are in a state such that they will not be able to pro-
	   vide statistics without a long delay.  When this option is speci-
	   fied, ddff will not request new statistics from the filesystems, but
	   will respond with the possibly stale statistics that were previous-
	   ly obtained.

BBUUGGSS
     The --nn flag is ignored if a file or filesystem is specified.
