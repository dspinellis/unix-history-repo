     In the first synopsis form, the ccpp utility copies the contents of the
     _s_o_u_r_c_e__f_i_l_e to the _t_a_r_g_e_t__f_i_l_e.  In the second synopsis form, the con-
     tents of each named _s_o_u_r_c_e__f_i_l_e is copied to the destination
     _t_a_r_g_e_t__d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y.	The names of the files themselves are not changed.  If
     ccpp detects an attempt to copy a file to itself, the copy will fail.

     The following options are available:

     --ff    For each existing destination pathname, remove it and create a new
	   file, without prompting for confirmation regardless of its permis-
	   sions.  (The --ii option is ignored if the --ff option is specified.)

     --hh    Forces ccpp to follow symbolic links.	Provided for the --RR option
	   which does not follow symbolic links by default.

     --ii    Causes ccpp to write a prompt to standard error before copying a file
	   that would overwrite an existing file.  If the response from the
	   standard input begins with the character `y', the file is copied if
	   permissions allow the copy.

     --pp    Causes ccpp to preserve in the copy as many of the modification time,
	   access time, file mode, user ID, and group ID as allowed by permis-
	   sions.

	   If the user ID and group ID cannot be preserved, no error message
	   is displayed and the exit value is not altered.

	   If the source file has its set user ID bit on and the user ID can-
	   not be preserved, the set user ID bit is not preserved in the
	   copy's permissions.	If the source file has its set group ID bit on
	   and the group ID cannot be preserved, the set group ID bit is not
	   preserved in the copy's permissions.  If the source file has both
	   the set user ID and set group ID bits on and either the user ID or
	   group ID cannot be preserved, neither the set user ID or set group
	   ID bits are preserved in the copy's permissions.

     --RR    If _s_o_u_r_c_e__f_i_l_e designates a directory, ccpp copies the directory and
	   the entire subtree connected at that point.	This option also
	   causes symbolic links to be copied, rather than indirected through,
	   and for ccpp to create special files rather than copying them as nor-
	   mal files.  Created directories have the same mode as the
	   corresponding source directory, unmodified by the process' umask.

     For each destination file that already exists, its contents are overwrit-
     ten if permissions allow, but its mode, user ID, and group ID are un-
     changed.

     If the destination file does not exist, the mode of the source file is
     used as modified by the file mode creation mask (uummaasskk, see csh(1)).  If
     the source file has its set user ID bit on, that bit is removed unless
     both the source file and the destination file are owned by the same user.
     If the source file has its set group ID bit on, that bit is removed
     unless both the source file and the destination file are in the same
     group and the user is a member of that group.  If both the set user ID
     and set group ID bits are set, all of the above conditions must be
     fulfilled or both bits are removed.
     Appropriate permissions are required for file creation or overwriting.

     Symbolic links are followed unless the --RR option is specified, in which
     case the link itself is copied.

     CCpp exits 0 on success, >0 if an error occurred.
