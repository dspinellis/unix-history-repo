     RRddiisstt is a program to maintain identical copies of files over multiple
     hosts.  It preserves the owner, group, mode, and mtime of files if possi-
     ble and can update programs that are executing.  RRddiisstt reads commands
     from _d_i_s_t_f_i_l_e to direct the updating of files and/or directories.

     Options specific to the first SYNOPSIS form:

     --	       If _d_i_s_t_f_i_l_e is `--', the standard input is used.

     --ff _d_i_s_t_f_i_l_e
	       Use the specified _d_i_s_t_f_i_l_e.

     If either the --ff or `--' option is not specified, the program looks first
     for ``_d_i_s_t_f_i_l_e'', then ``_D_i_s_t_f_i_l_e'' to use as the input.  If no names are
     specified on the command line, rrddiisstt will update all of the files and
     directories listed in _d_i_s_t_f_i_l_e.  Otherwise, the argument is taken to be
     the name of a file to be updated or the label of a command to execute. If
     label and file names conflict, it is assumed to be a label.  These may be
     used together to update specific files using specific commands.

     Options specific to the second SYNOPSIS form:

     --cc        Forces rrddiisstt to interpret the remaining arguments as a small
	       _d_i_s_t_f_i_l_e.

	       The equivalent distfile is as follows.

		     (_n_a_m_e ...) -> [_l_o_g_i_n@] _h_o_s_t
			   install [_d_e_s_t];

     Options common to both forms:

     --dd _v_a_r=_v_a_l_u_e
	       Define _v_a_r to have _v_a_l_u_e.  The --dd option is used to define or
	       override variable definitions in the _d_i_s_t_f_i_l_e.  _V_a_l_u_e can be
	       the empty string, one name, or a list of names surrounded by
	       parentheses and separated by tabs and/or spaces.

     --mm _h_o_s_t   Limit which machines are to be updated. Multiple --mm arguments
	       can be given to limit updates to a subset of the hosts listed
	       the _d_i_s_t_f_i_l_e.

     --nn        Print the commands without executing them. This option is use-
	       ful for debugging _d_i_s_t_f_i_l_e.

     --qq        Quiet mode. Files that are being modified are normally printed
	       on standard output. The --qq option suppresses this.

     --RR        Remove extraneous files. If a directory is being updated, any
	       files that exist on the remote host that do not exist in the
	       master directory are removed.  This is useful for maintaining
	       truely identical copies of directories.

     --hh        Follow symbolic links. Copy the file that the link points to
	       rather than the link itself.
     --ii        Ignore unresolved links.  RRddiisstt will normally try to maintain
	       the link structure of files being transfered and warn the user
	       if all the links cannot be found.

     --vv        Verify that the files are up to date on all the hosts. Any
	       files that are out of date will be displayed but no files will
	       be changed nor any mail sent.

     --ww        Whole mode. The whole file name is appended to the destination
	       directory name. Normally, only the last component of a name is
	       used when renaming files.  This will preserve the directory
	       structure of the files being copied instead of flattening the
	       directory structure. For example, renaming a list of files such
	       as ( dir1/f1 dir2/f2 ) to dir3 would create files dir3/dir1/f1
	       and dir3/dir2/f2 instead of dir3/f1 and dir3/f2.

     --yy        Younger mode. Files are normally updated if their _m_t_i_m_e and
	       _s_i_z_e (see stat(2)) disagree. The --yy option causes rrddiisstt not to
	       update files that are younger than the master copy.  This can
	       be used to prevent newer copies on other hosts from being re-
	       placed.	A warning message is printed for files which are newer
	       than the master copy.

     --bb        Binary comparison. Perform a binary comparison and update files
	       if they differ rather than comparing dates and sizes.

     _D_i_s_t_f_i_l_e contains a sequence of entries that specify the files to be
     copied, the destination hosts, and what operations to perform to do the
     updating. Each entry has one of the following formats.

	   <variable name> `=' <name list>
	   [label:]<source list> `->' <destination list> <command list>
	   [label:]<source list> `::' <time_stamp file> <command list>

     The first format is used for defining variables.  The second format is
     used for distributing files to other hosts.  The third format is used for
     making lists of files that have been changed since some given date.  The
     _s_o_u_r_c_e _l_i_s_t specifies a list of files and/or directories on the local
     host which are to be used as the master copy for distribution.  The
     _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n _l_i_s_t is the list of hosts to which these files are to be
     copied.  Each file in the source list is added to a list of changes if
     the file is out of date on the host which is being updated (second for-
     mat) or the file is newer than the time stamp file (third format).

     Labels are optional. They are used to identify a command for partial up-
     dates.

     Newlines, tabs, and blanks are only used as separators and are otherwise
     ignored. Comments begin with `#' and end with a newline.

     Variables to be expanded begin with `$' followed by one character or a
     name enclosed in curly braces (see the examples at the end).

     The source and destination lists have the following format:

	   <name>
     or
	   `(' <zero or more names separated by white-space> `)'

     The shell meta-characters `[', `]', `{', `}', `*', and `?' are recognized
     and expanded (on the local host only) in the same way as csh(1).  They
     can be escaped with a backslash.  The `~' character is also expanded in
     the same way as csh(1) but is expanded separately on the local and desti-
     nation hosts.  When the --ww option is used with a file name that begins
     with `~', everything except the home directory is appended to the desti-
     nation name.  File names which do not begin with `/' or `~' use the des-
     tination user's home directory as the root directory for the rest of the
     file name.

     The command list consists of zero or more commands of the following for-
     mat.

	   `install'	  <options>	   opt_dest_name `;'
	   `notify'	  <name list>	   `;'
	   `except'	  <name list>	   `;'
	   `except_pat'   <pattern list>   `;'
	   `special'	  <name list>	   string `;'

     The iinnssttaallll command is used to copy out of date files and/or directories.
     Each source file is copied to each host in the destination list.  Direc-
     tories are recursively copied in the same way.  _O_p_t__d_e_s_t__n_a_m_e is an op-
     tional parameter to rename files.	If no iinnssttaallll command appears in the
     command list or the destination name is not specified, the source file
     name is used.  Directories in the path name will be created if they do
     not exist on the remote host.  To help prevent disasters, a non-empty
     directory on a target host will never be replaced with a regular file or
     a symbolic link.  However, under the `-R' option a non-empty directory
     will be removed if the corresponding filename is completely absent on the
     master host.  The _o_p_t_i_o_n_s are `-R', `-h', `-i', `-v', `-w', `-y', and
     `-b' and have the same semantics as options on the command line except
     they only apply to the files in the source list.  The login name used on
     the destination host is the same as the local host unless the destination
     name is of the format ``login@host".

     The nnoottiiffyy command is used to mail the list of files updated (and any er-
     rors that may have occured) to the listed names.  If no `@' appears in
     the name, the destination host is appended to the name (e.g., name1@host,
     name2@host, ...).

     The eexxcceepptt command is used to update all of the files in the source list
     eexxcceepptt for the files listed in _n_a_m_e _l_i_s_t.	This is usually used to copy
     everything in a directory except certain files.

     The eexxcceepptt__ppaatt command is like the eexxcceepptt command except that _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
     _l_i_s_t is a list of regular expressions (see ed(1) for details).  If one of
     the patterns matches some string within a file name, that file will be
     ignored.  Note that since `\' is a quote character, it must be doubled to
     become part of the regular expression.  Variables are expanded in _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
     _l_i_s_t but not shell file pattern matching characters.  To include a `$',
     it must be escaped with `\'.

     The ssppeecciiaall command is used to specify sh(1) commands that are to be exe-
     cuted on the remote host after the file in _n_a_m_e _l_i_s_t is updated or in-
     stalled.  If the _n_a_m_e _l_i_s_t is omitted then the shell commands will be ex-
     ecuted for every file updated or installed.  The shell variable `FILE' is
     set to the current filename before executing the commands in _s_t_r_i_n_g.
     _S_t_r_i_n_g starts and ends with `"' and can cross multiple lines in _d_i_s_t_f_i_l_e.
     Multiple commands to the shell should be separated by `;'.  Commands are
     executed in the user's home directory on the host being updated.  The
     _s_p_e_c_i_a_l command can be used to rebuild private databases, etc.  after a
     program has been updated.

     The following is a small example:

	   HOSTS = ( matisse root@arpa )

	   FILES = ( /bin /lib /usr/bin /usr/games
	   /usr/include/{*.h,{stand,sys,vax*,pascal,machine}/*.h}
	   /usr/lib /usr/man/man? /usr/ucb /usr/local/rdist )

	   EXLIB = ( Mail.rc aliases aliases.dir aliases.pag crontab dshrc
	   sendmail.cf sendmail.fc sendmail.hf sendmail.st uucp vfont )

	   ${FILES} -> ${HOSTS}
	   install -R ;
	   except /usr/lib/${EXLIB} ;
	   except /usr/games/lib ;
	   special /usr/lib/sendmail "/usr/lib/sendmail -bz" ;

	   srcs:
	   /usr/src/bin -> arpa
	   except_pat ( \\.o\$ /SCCS\$ ) ;

	   IMAGEN = (ips dviimp catdvi)

	   imagen:
	   /usr/local/${IMAGEN} -> arpa
	   install /usr/local/lib ;
	   notify ralph ;

	   ${FILES} :: stamp.cory
	   notify root@cory ;

     The rrddiisstt command appeared in 4.3 BSD.

     A complaint about mismatch of rdist version numbers may really stem from
     some problem with starting your shell, e.g., you are in too many groups.

BBUUGGSS
     Source files must reside on the local host where rrddiisstt is executed.

     There is no easy way to have a special command executed after all files
     in a directory have been updated.

     Variable expansion only works for name lists; there should be a general
     macro facility.

     RRddiisstt aborts on files which have a negative mtime (before Jan 1, 1970).

     There should be a `force' option to allow replacement of non-empty direc-
     tories by regular files or symlinks.  A means of updating file modes and
     owners of otherwise identical files is also needed.
