     LLpprr uses a spooling daemon to print the named files when facilities be-
     come available.  If no names appear, the standard input is assumed.

     The following single letter options are used to notify the line printer
     spooler that the files are not standard text files. The spooling daemon
     will use the appropriate filters to print the data accordingly.

     --cc        The files are assumed to contain data produced by cifplot(1)

     --dd        The files are assumed to contain data from _t_e_x (DVI format from
	       Stanford).

     --ff        Use a filter which interprets the first character of each line
	       as a standard FORTRAN carriage control character.

     --gg        The files are assumed to contain standard plot data as produced
	       by the plot routines (see also plot for the filters used by the
	       printer spooler).

     --ll        Use a filter which allows control characters to be printed and
	       suppresses page breaks.

     --nn        The files are assumed to contain data from _d_i_t_r_o_f_f (device in-
	       dependent troff).

     --pp        Use pr(1) to format the files (equivalent to _p_r_i_n_t).

     --tt        The files are assumed to contain data from troff(1) (cat photo-
	       typesetter commands).

     --vv        The files are assumed to contain a raster image for devices
	       like the Benson Varian.

     These options apply to the handling of the print job:

     --PP        Force output to a specific printer.  Normally, the default
	       printer is used (site dependent), or the value of the environ-
	       ment variable PRINTER is used.

     --hh        Suppress the printing of the burst page.

     --mm        Send mail upon completion.

     --rr        Remove the file upon completion of spooling or upon completion
	       of printing (with the --ss option).

     --ss        Use symbolic links.  Usually files are copied to the spool
	       directory.  The --ss option will use symlink(2) to link data
	       files rather than trying to copy them so large files can be
	       printed.  This means the files should not be modified or re-
	       moved until they have been printed.

     The remaining options apply to copies, the page display, and headers:

     --##_n_u_m     The quantity _n_u_m is the number of copies desired of each file
	       named.  For example,
		     lpr -#3 foo.c bar.c more.c

	       would result in 3 copies of the file foo.c, followed by 3
	       copies of the file bar.c, etc.  On the other hand,

		     cat foo.c bar.c more.c | lpr -#3

	       will give three copies of the concatenation of the files. Often
	       a site will disable this feature to encourage use of a photo-
	       copier instead.

     --[11223344] _f_o_n_t
	       Specifies a _f_o_n_t to be mounted on font position _i.  The daemon
	       will construct a .railmag file referencing the font pathname.

     --CC _c_l_a_s_s
	       Job classification to use on the burst page.  For example,

		     lpr -C EECS foo.c

	       causes the system name (the name returned by hostname(1)) to be
	       replaced on the burst page by EECS, and the file foo.c to be
	       printed.

     --JJ _j_o_b    Job name to print on the burst page.  Normally, the first
	       file's name is used.

     --TT _t_i_t_l_e
	       Title name for pr(1), instead of the file name.

     --UU _u_s_e_r   User name to print on the burst page, also for accounting
	       purposes.  This option is only honored if the real user-id is
	       daemon (or that specified in the printcap file instead of
	       daemon), and is intended for those instances where print
	       filters wish to requeue jobs.

     --ii [numcols]
	       The output is indented. If the next argument is numeric
	       (_n_u_m_c_o_l_s), it is used as the number of blanks to be printed
	       before each line; otherwise, 8 characters are printed.

     --ww_n_u_m     Uses _n_u_m as the page width for pr(1).

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     If the following environment variable exists, it is used by llpprr:

     PRINTER   Specifies an alternate default printer.

     LLpprr appeared in 3 BSD.

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
     If you try to spool too large a file, it will be truncated.  LLpprr will ob-
     ject to printing binary files.  If a user other than root prints a file
     and spooling is disabled, llpprr will print a message saying so and will not
     put jobs in the queue.  If a connection to lpd(1) on the local machine
     cannot be made, llpprr will say that the daemon cannot be started.  Diagnos-
     tics may be printed in the daemon's log file regarding missing spool
     files by lpd(1).

BBUUGGSS
     Fonts for troff(1) and tex reside on the host with the printer. It is
     currently not possible to use local font libraries.
