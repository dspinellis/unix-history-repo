IINNTTRROODDUUCCTTIIOONN
     MMaaiill is a intelligent mail processing system, which has a command syntax
     reminiscent of ed(1) with lines replaced by messages.

     --vv    Verbose mode. The details of delivery are displayed on the users
	   terminal.

     --ii    Ignore tty interrupt signals. This is particularly useful when us-
	   ing mmaaiill on noisy phone lines.

     --II    Forces mail to run in interactive mode even when input isn't a ter-
	   minal.  In particular, the `~~' special character when sending mail
	   is only active in interactive mode.

     --nn    Inhibits reading /_u_s_r/_s_h_a_r_e/_m_i_s_c/_M_a_i_l._r_c upon startup.

     --NN    Inhibits the initial display of message headers when reading mail
	   or editing a mail folder.

     --ss    Specify subject on command line (only the first argument after the
	   --ss flag is used as a subject; be careful to quote subjects contain-
	   ing spaces.)

     --cc    Send carbon copies to _l_i_s_t of users.

     --bb    Send blind carbon copies to _l_i_s_t.  List should be a comma-separated
	   list of names.

     --ff    Read in the contents of your _m_b_o_x (or the specified file) for pro-
	   cessing; when you _q_u_i_t, mmaaiill writes undeleted messages back to this
	   file.

     --uu    Is equivalent to:
		 mail -f /var/spool/mail/user

  SSeennddiinngg mmaaiill
     To send a message to one or more people, mmaaiill can be invoked with argu-
     ments which are the names of people to whom the mail will be sent.  You
     are then expected to type in your message, followed by an `control-D' at
     the beginning of a line.  The section below _R_e_p_l_y_i_n_g _t_o _o_r _o_r_i_g_i_n_a_t_i_n_g
     _m_a_i_l, describes some features of mmaaiill available to help you compose your
     letter.

  RReeaaddiinngg mmaaiill
     In normal usage mmaaiill is given no arguments and checks your mail out of
     the post office, then prints out a one line header of each message found.
     The current message is initially the first message (numbered 1) and can
     be printed using the pprriinntt command (which can be abbreviated (pp)).  You
     can move among the messages much as you move between lines in ed(1), with
     the commands `++' and `--' moving backwards and forwards, and simple
     numbers.

  DDiissppoossiinngg ooff mmaaiill..
     After examining a message you can ddeelleettee (dd) the message or rreeppllyy (rr) to
     it.  Deletion causes the mmaaiill program to forget about the message.  This
     is not irreversible; the message can be uunnddeelleetteedd (uu) by giving its
     number, or the mmaaiill session can be aborted by giving the eexxiitt (xx)
     command.  Deleted messages will, however, usually disappear never to be
     seen again.

  SSppeecciiffyyiinngg mmeessssaaggeess
     Commands such as pprriinntt and ddeelleettee can be given a list of message numbers
     as arguments to apply to a number of messages at once.  Thus ``delete 1
     2'' deletes messages 1 and 2, while ``delete 1-5'' deletes messages 1
     through 5.  The special name `*' addresses all messages, and `$' ad-
     dresses the last message; thus the command ttoopp which prints the first few
     lines of a message could be used in ``top *'' to print the first few
     lines of all messages.

  RReeppllyyiinngg ttoo oorr oorriiggiinnaattiinngg mmaaiill..
     You can use the rreeppllyy command to set up a response to a message, sending
     it back to the person who it was from.  Text you then type in, up to an
     end-of-file, defines the contents of the message.	While you are compos-
     ing a message, mmaaiill treats lines beginning with the character `~~' spe-
     cially.  For instance, typing `~~mm' (alone on a line) will place a copy of
     the current message into the response right shifting it by a tabstop (see
     _i_n_d_e_n_t_p_r_e_f_i_x variable, below).  Other escapes will set up subject fields,
     add and delete recipients to the message and allow you to escape to an
     editor to revise the message or to a shell to run some commands.  (These
     options are given in the summary below.)

  EEnnddiinngg aa mmaaiill pprroocceessssiinngg sseessssiioonn..
     You can end a mmaaiill session with the qquuiitt (qq) command.  Messages which
     have been examined go to your _m_b_o_x file unless they have been deleted in
     which case they are discarded.  Unexamined messages go back to the post
     office. (See the --ff option above).

     It is also possible to create a personal distribution lists so that, for
     instance, you can send mail to ``cohorts'' and have it go to a group of
     people.  Such lists can be defined by placing a line like

	   alias cohorts bill ozalp jkf mark kridle@ucbcory

     in the file ._m_a_i_l_r_c in your home directory.  The current list of such
     aliases can be displayed with the aalliiaass command in mmaaiill.  System wide
     distribution lists can be created by editing /_e_t_c/_a_l_i_a_s_e_s, see aliases(5)
     and sendmail(8); these are kept in a different syntax.  In mail you send,
     personal aliases will be expanded in mail sent to others so that they
     will be able to rreeppllyy to the recipients.  System wide aalliiaasseess are not ex-
     panded when the mail is sent, but any reply returned to the machine will
     have the system wide alias expanded as all mail goes through sendmail.

  NNeettwwoorrkk mmaaiill ((AARRPPAA,, UUUUCCPP,, BBeerrkknneett))
     See mailaddr(7) for a description of network addresses.

     MMaaiill has a number of options which can be set in the  ._m_a_i_l_r_c file to
     alter its behavior; thus ``set askcc'' enables the _a_s_k_c_c feature.	(These
     options are summarized below.)

SSUUMMMMAARRYY
     (Adapted from the `Mail Reference Manual')

     Each command is typed on a line by itself, and may take arguments follow-
     ing the command word.  The command need not be typed in its entirety -
     the first command which matches the typed prefix is used.	For commands
     which take message lists as arguments, if no message list is given, then
     the next message forward which satisfies the command's requirements is
     used.  If there are no messages forward of the current message, the
     search proceeds backwards, and if there are no good messages at all, mmaaiill
     types ``No applicable messages'' and aborts the command.

     --	       Print out the preceding message.  If given a numeric argument
	       _n, goes to the _n'th previous message and prints it.

     ??	       Prints a brief summary of commands.

     !!	       Executes the shell (see sh(1) and csh(1)) command which fol-
	       lows.

     PPrriinntt     (PP) Like pprriinntt but also prints out ignored header fields. See
	       also pprriinntt, iiggnnoorree and rreettaaiinn.

     RReeppllyy     (RR) Reply to originator. Does not reply to other recipients of
	       the original message.

     TTyyppee      (TT) Identical to the PPrriinntt command.

     aalliiaass     (aa) With no arguments, prints out all currently-defined
	       aliases.  With one argument, prints out that alias.  With more
	       than one argument, creates a new alias or changes an old one.

     aalltteerrnnaatteess
	       (aalltt) The aalltteerrnnaatteess command is useful if you have accounts on
	       several machines.  It can be used to inform mmaaiill that the list-
	       ed addresses are really you. When you rreeppllyy to messages, mmaaiill
	       will not send a copy of the message to any of the addresses
	       listed on the aalltteerrnnaatteess list. If the aalltteerrnnaatteess command is
	       given with no argument, the current set of alternate names is
	       displayed.

     cchhddiirr     (cc) Changes the user's working directory to that specified, if
	       given.  If no directory is given, then changes to the user's
	       login directory.

     ccooppyy      (ccoo) The ccooppyy command does the same thing that ssaavvee does, ex-
	       cept that it does not mark the messages it is used on for dele-
	       tion when you quit.

     ddeelleettee    (dd) Takes a list of messages as argument and marks them all as
	       deleted.  Deleted messages will not be saved in _m_b_o_x, nor will
	       they be available for most other commands.

     ddpp        (also ddtt) Deletes the current message and prints the next mes-
	       sage.  If there is no next message, mmaaiill says ``at EOF.''

     eeddiitt      (ee) Takes a list of messages and points the text editor at each
	       one in turn.  On return from the editor, the message is read
	       back in.

     eexxiitt      (eexx or xx) Effects an immediate return to the Shell without
	       modifying the user's system mailbox, his _m_b_o_x file, or his edit
	       file in --ff.

     ffiillee      (ffii) The same as ffoollddeerr.

     ffoollddeerrss   List the names of the folders in your folder directory.

     ffoollddeerr    (ffoo) The ffoollddeerr command switches to a new mail file or folder.
	       With no arguments, it tells you which file you are currently
	       reading.  If you give it an argument, it will write out changes
	       (such as deletions) you have made in the current file and read
	       in the new file. Some special conventions are recognized for
	       the name. # means the previous file, % means your system mail-
	       box, %user means user's system mailbox, & means your _m_b_o_x file,
	       and +folder means a file in your folder directory.

     ffrroomm      (ff) Takes a list of messages and prints their message headers.

     hheeaaddeerrss   (hh) Lists the current range of headers, which is an 18-message
	       group.  If a `+' argument is given, then the next 18-message
	       group is printed, and if a `-' argument is given, the previous
	       18-message group is printed.

     hheellpp      A synonym for ??

     hhoolldd      (hhoo, also pprreesseerrvvee) Takes a message list and marks each message
	       therein to be saved in the user's system mailbox instead of in
	       _m_b_o_x.  Does not override the ddeelleettee command.

     iiggnnoorree    NN..BB..:: IIggnnoorree has been superseded by rreettaaiinn.
	       Add the list of header fields named to the _i_g_n_o_r_e_d _l_i_s_t Header
	       fields in the ignore list are not printed on your terminal when
	       you print a message. This command is very handy for suppression
	       of certain machine-generated header fields. The TTyyppee and PPrriinntt
	       commands can be used to print a message in its entirety, in-
	       cluding ignored fields. If iiggnnoorree is executed with no argu-
	       ments, it lists the current set of ignored fields.

     mmaaiill      (mm) Takes as argument login names and distribution group names
	       and sends mail to those people.

     mmbbooxx      Indicate that a list of messages be sent to mmbbooxx in your home
	       directory when you quit. This is the default action for mes-
	       sages if you do _n_o_t have the hhoolldd option set.

     nneexxtt      (nn like ++ or CR) Goes to the next message in sequence and types
	       it.  With an argument list, types the next matching message.

     pprreesseerrvvee
	       (pprree) A synonym for hhoolldd.

     pprriinntt     (pp) Takes a message list and types out each message on the
	       user's terminal.

     qquuiitt      (qq) Terminates the session, saving all undeleted, unsaved
	       messages in the user's _m_b_o_x file in his login directory,
	       preserving all messages marked with hhoolldd or pprreesseerrvvee or never
	       referenced in his system mailbox, and removing all other mes-
	       sages from his system mailbox.  If new mail has arrived during
	       the session, the message ``You have new mail'' is given.  If
	       given while editing a mailbox file with the --ff flag, then the
	       edit file is rewritten.	A return to the Shell is effected, un-
	       less the rewrite of edit file fails, in which case the user can
	       escape with the eexxiitt command.

     rreeppllyy     (rr) Takes a message list and sends mail to the sender and all
	       recipients of the specified message.  The default message must
	       not be deleted.

     rreessppoonndd   A synonym for rreeppllyy.

     rreettaaiinn    Add the list of header fields named to the _r_e_t_a_i_n_e_d _l_i_s_t Only
	       the header fields in the retain list are shown on your terminal
	       when you print a message.  All other header fields are
	       suppressed.  The TTyyppee and PPrriinntt commands can be used to print a
	       message in its entirety.  If rreettaaiinn is executed with no argu-
	       ments, it lists the current set of retained fields.

     ssaavvee      (ss) Takes a message list and a filename and appends each
	       message in turn to the end of the file.	The filename in
	       quotes, followed by the line count and character count is
	       echoed on the user's terminal.

     sseett       (ssee) With no arguments, prints all variable values.  Otherwise,
	       sets option.  Arguments are of the form _o_p_t_i_o_n=_v_a_l_u_e (no space
	       before or after =) or _o_p_t_i_o_n.  Quotation marks may be placed
	       around any part of the assignment statement to quote blanks or
	       tabs, i.e.  ``set indentprefix="->"''

     ssaavveeiiggnnoorree
	       SSaavveeiiggnnoorree is to ssaavvee what iiggnnoorree is to pprriinntt and ttyyppee.	Header
	       fields thus marked are filtered out when saving a message by
	       ssaavvee or when automatically saving to _m_b_o_x.

     ssaavveerreettaaiinn
	       SSaavveerreettaaiinn is to ssaavvee what rreettaaiinn is to pprriinntt and ttyyppee.	Header
	       fields thus marked are the only ones saved with a message when
	       saving by ssaavvee or when automatically saving to _m_b_o_x.
	       SSaavveerreettaaiinn overrides ssaavveeiiggnnoorree.

     sshheellll     (sshh) Invokes an interactive version of the shell.

     ssiizzee      Takes a message list and prints out the size in characters of
	       each message.

     ssoouurrccee    The command reads commands from a file.

     ttoopp       Takes a message list and prints the top few lines of each.  The
	       number of lines printed is controlled by the variable ttoopplliinneess
	       and defaults to five.

     ttyyppee      (tt) A synonym for pprriinntt.

     uunnaalliiaass   Takes a list of names defined by aalliiaass commands and discards
	       the remembered groups of users.	The group names no longer have
	       any significance.

     uunnddeelleettee
	       (uu) Takes a message list and marks each message as nnoott being
	       deleted.

     uunnrreeaadd    (UU) Takes a message list and marks each message as nnoott having
	       been read.

     uunnsseett     Takes a list of option names and discards their remembered
	       values; the inverse of sseett.

     vviissuuaall    (vv) Takes a message list and invokes the display editor on each
	       message.

     wwrriittee     (ww) Similar to ssaavvee, except that oonnllyy the message body (_w_i_t_h_o_u_t
	       the header) is saved.  Extremely useful for such tasks as
	       sending and receiving source program text over the message
	       system.

     xxiitt       (xx) A synonym for eexxiitt.

     zz	       MMaaiill presents message headers in windowfuls as described under
	       the hheeaaddeerrss command. You can move mmaaiill's attention forward to
	       the next window with the zz command. Also, you can move to the
	       previous window by using zz--.

  TTiillddee//EEssccaappeess

     Here is a summary of the tilde escapes, which are used when composing
     messages to perform special functions.  Tilde escapes are only recognized
     at the beginning of lines.  The name ``_t_i_l_d_e _e_s_c_a_p_e'' is somewhat of a
     misnomer since the actual escape character can be set by the option
     eessccaappee.

     ~~!!_c_o_m_m_a_n_d
	   Execute the indicated shell command, then return to the message.

     ~~bb_n_a_m_e ...
	   Add the given names to the list of carbon copy recipients but do
	   not make the names visible in the Cc: line ("blind" carbon copy).

     ~~cc_n_a_m_e ...
	   Add the given names to the list of carbon copy recipients.

     ~~dd    Read the file ``_d_e_a_d._l_e_t_t_e_r'' from your home directory into the
	   message.

     ~~ee    Invoke the text editor on the message collected so far.  After the
	   editing session is finished, you may continue appending text to the
	   message.

     ~~ff_m_e_s_s_a_g_e_s
	   Read the named messages into the message being sent.  If no
	   messages are specified, read in the current message.  Message
	   headers currently being ignored (by the iiggnnoorree or rreettaaiinn command)
	   are not included.

     ~~FF_m_e_s_s_a_g_e_s
	   Identical to ~~ff, except all message headers are included.

     ~~hh    Edit the message header fields by typing each one in turn and al-
	   lowing the user to append text to the end or modify the field by
	   using the current terminal erase and kill characters.

     ~~mm_m_e_s_s_a_g_e_s
	   Read the named messages into the message being sent, indented by a
	   tab or by the value of _i_n_d_e_n_t_p_r_e_f_i_x.  If no messages are specified,
	   read the current message.  Message headers currently being ignored
	   (by the iiggnnoorree or rreettaaiinn command) are not included.

     ~~MM_m_e_s_s_a_g_e_s
	   Identical to ~~mm, except all message headers are included.

     ~~pp    Print out the message collected so far, prefaced by the message
	   header fields.

     ~~qq    Abort the message being sent, copying the message to
	   ``_d_e_a_d._l_e_t_t_e_r'' in your home directory if ssaavvee is set.

     ~~rr_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
	   Read the named file into the message.

     ~~ss_s_t_r_i_n_g
	   Cause the named string to become the current subject field.

     ~~tt_n_a_m_e ...
	   Add the given names to the direct recipient list.

     ~~vv    Invoke an alternate editor (defined by the VISUAL option) on the
	   message collected so far.  Usually, the alternate editor will be a
	   screen editor.  After you quit the editor, you may resume appending
	   text to the end of your message.

     ~~ww_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
	   Write the message onto the named file.

     ~~||_c_o_m_m_a_n_d
	   Pipe the message through the command as a filter.  If the command
	   gives no output or terminates abnormally, retain the original text
	   of the message.  The command fmt(1) is often used as ccoommmmaanndd to re-
	   justify the message.

     ~~::_m_a_i_l-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d
	   Execute the given mail command.  Not all commands, however, are
	   allowed.

     ~~~~_s_t_r_i_n_g
	   Insert the string of text in the message prefaced by a single ~.
	   If you have changed the escape character, then you should double
	   that character in order to send it.

  MMaaiill OOppttiioonnss
     Options are controlled via sseett and uunnsseett commands.  Options may be either
     binary, in which case it is only significant to see whether they are set
     or not; or string, in which case the actual value is of interest.	The
     binary options include the following:

     _a_p_p_e_n_d	 Causes messages saved in _m_b_o_x to be appended to the end rath-
		 er than prepended.  This should always be set (perhaps in
		 /_u_s_r/_s_h_a_r_e/_m_i_s_c/_M_a_i_l._r_c).

     _a_s_k	 Causes mmaaiill to prompt you for the subject of each message you
		 send.	If you respond with simply a newline, no subject field
		 will be sent.

     _a_s_k_c_c	 Causes you to be prompted for additional carbon copy reci-
		 pients at the end of each message.  Responding with a newline
		 indicates your satisfaction with the current list.

     _a_u_t_o_p_r_i_n_t	 Causes the ddeelleettee command to behave like ddpp - thus, after
		 deleting a message, the next one will be typed automatically.

     _d_e_b_u_g	 Setting the binary option _d_e_b_u_g is the same as specifying --dd
		 on the command line and causes mmaaiill to output all sorts of
		 information useful for debugging mmaaiill.

     _d_o_t	 The binary option _d_o_t causes mmaaiill to interpret a period alone
		 on a line as the terminator of a message you are sending.

     _h_o_l_d	 This option is used to hold messages in the system mailbox by
		 default.

     _i_g_n_o_r_e	 Causes interrupt signals from your terminal to be ignored and
		 echoed as @'s.

     _i_g_n_o_r_e_e_o_f	 An option related to _d_o_t is _i_g_n_o_r_e_e_o_f which makes mmaaiill refuse
		 to accept a control-d as the end of a message.  _I_g_n_o_r_e_e_o_f
		 also applies to mmaaiill command mode.

     _m_e_t_o_o	 Usually, when a group is expanded that contains the sender,
		 the sender is removed from the expansion.  Setting this op-
		 tion causes the sender to be included in the group.

     _n_o_h_e_a_d_e_r	 Setting the option _n_o_h_e_a_d_e_r is the same as giving the --NN flag
		 on the command line.

     _n_o_s_a_v_e	 Normally, when you abort a message with two RUBOUT (erase or
		 delete) mmaaiill copies the partial letter to the file
		 ``_d_e_a_d._l_e_t_t_e_r'' in your home directory. Setting the binary
		 option _n_o_s_a_v_e prevents this.

     _R_e_p_l_y_a_l_l	 Reverses the sense of rreeppllyy and RReeppllyy commands.

     _q_u_i_e_t	 Suppresses the printing of the version when first invoked.

     _v_e_r_b_o_s_e	 Setting the option _v_e_r_b_o_s_e is the same as using the --vv flag
		 on the command line. When mail runs in verbose mode, the ac-
		 tual delivery of messages is displayed on he users terminal.

     _E_D_I_T_O_R	 Pathname of the text editor to use in the eeddiitt command and ~~ee
		 escape.  If not defined, then a default editor is used.

     _L_I_S_T_E_R	 Pathname of the directory lister to use in the ffoollddeerrss com-
		 mand.	Default is /_b_i_n/_l_s.

     _P_A_G_E_R	 Pathname of the program to use in the mmoorree command or when
		 ccrrtt variable is set.  The default paginator more(1) is used
		 if this option is not defined.

     _S_H_E_L_L	 Pathname of the shell to use in the !!	command and the ~~!!
		 escape.  A default shell is used if this option is not de-
		 fined.

     _V_I_S_U_A_L	 Pathname of the text editor to use in the vviissuuaall command and
		 ~~vv escape.

     _c_r_t	 The valued option _c_r_t is used as a threshold to determine how
		 long a message must be before _P_A_G_E_R is used to read it.  If
		 _c_r_t is set without a value, then the height of the terminal
		 screen stored in the system is used to compute the threshold
		 (see stty(1)).

     _e_s_c_a_p_e	 If defined, the first character of this option gives the
		 character to use in the place of ~ to denote escapes.

     _f_o_l_d_e_r	 The name of the directory to use for storing folders of mes-
		 sages. If this name begins with a `/', mmaaiill considers it to
		 be an absolute pathname; otherwise, the folder directory is
		 found relative to your home directory.

     _M_B_O_X	 The name of the _m_b_o_x file.  It can be the name of a folder.
		 The default is ``mbox'' in the user's home directory.

     _r_e_c_o_r_d	 If defined, gives the pathname of the file used to record all
		 outgoing mail.  If not defined, then outgoing mail is not so
		 saved.

     _i_n_d_e_n_t_p_r_e_f_i_x
		 String used by the ``~m'' tilde escape for indenting mes-
		 sages, in place of the normal tab character (^I).  Be sure to
		 quote the value if it contains spaces or tabs.

     _t_o_p_l_i_n_e_s	 If defined, gives the number of lines of a message to be
		 printed out with the ttoopp command; normally, the first five
		 lines are printed.

     There are some flags that are not documented here. Most are not useful to
     the general user.

     Usually, mmaaiill is just a link to MMaaiill, which can be confusing.
