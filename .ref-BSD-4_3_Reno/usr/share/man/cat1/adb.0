     AAddbb is a general purpose debugging program.  It may be used to examine
     files and to provide a controlled environment for the execution of UNIX
     programs.

     _O_b_j_f_i_l is normally an executable program file, preferably containing a
     symbol table; if not then the symbolic features of aaddbb cannot be used
     although the file can still be examined.  The default for _o_b_j_f_i_l is
     _a._o_u_t.  _C_o_r_f_i_l is assumed to be a core image file produced after execut-
     ing _o_b_j_f_i_l; the default for _c_o_r_f_i_l is _c_o_r_e

     Requests to aaddbb are read from the standard input and responses are to the
     standard output.  If the --ww flag is present then both _o_b_j_f_i_l and _c_o_r_f_i_l
     are created if necessary and opened for reading and writing so that files
     can be modified using aaddbb.

     The --kk option makes aaddbb do UNIX kernel memory mapping; it should be used
     when _c_o_r_e is a UNIX crash dump or /_d_e_v/_m_e_m.

     The --II option specifies a directory where files to be read with $$<< or $$<<<<
     (see below) will be sought; the default is /_u_s_r/_l_i_b/_a_d_b.

     AAddbb ignores QUIT; INTERRUPT causes return to the next aaddbb command.

     In general requests to aaddbb are of the form

	   [_a_d_d_r_e_s_s] [ _c_o_u_n_t] [ccoommmmaanndd] [;]

     If _a_d_d_r_e_s_s is present then _d_o_t is set to _a_d_d_r_e_s_s.	Initially _d_o_t is set
     to 0.  For most commands _c_o_u_n_t specifies how many times the command will
     be executed.  The default _c_o_u_n_t is 1.  _A_d_d_r_e_s_s and _c_o_u_n_t are expressions.

     The interpretation of an address depends on the context it is used in.
     If a subprocess is being debugged then addresses are interpreted in the
     usual way in the address space of the subprocess.	If the operating sys-
     tem is being debugged either post-mortem or using the special file
     /_d_e_v/_m_e_m to interactively examine and/or modify memory, the maps are set
     to map the kernel virtual addresses which start at 0x80000000 (on the
     VAX); see ADDRESSES below.

EEXXPPRREESSSSIIOONNSS
     ..		     The value of _d_o_t.

     ++		     The value of _d_o_t incremented by the current increment.

     ^^		     The value of _d_o_t decremented by the current increment.

     ""		     The last _a_d_d_r_e_s_s typed.

     _i_n_t_e_g_e_r	     A number.	The prefixes 0o and 0O (zero oh) force in-
		     terpretation in octal radix; the prefixes 0t and 0T force
		     interpretation in decimal radix; the prefixes 0x and 0X
		     force interpretation in hexadecimal radix.  Thus 0o20 =
		     0t16 = 0x10 = sixteen.  If no prefix appears, then the
		     _d_e_f_a_u_l_t _r_a_d_i_x is used; see the $$dd command.  The default
		     radix is initially hexadecimal.  The hexadecimal digits
		     are 0123456789abcdefABCDEF with the obvious values.  Note
		     that a hexadecimal number whose most significant digit
		     would otherwise be an alphabetic character must have a 0x
		     (or 0X) prefix (or a leading zero if the default radix is
		     hexadecimal).

     _i_n_t_e_g_e_r._f_r_a_c_t_i_o_n
		     A 32 bit floating point number.

     'cccc'	     The ASCII value of up to 4 characters.  \ may be used to
		     escape a '.

     < _n_a_m_e	     The value of _n_a_m_e, which is either a variable name or a
		     register name.  AAddbb maintains a number of variables (see
		     VARIABLES below) named by single letters or digits.  If
		     _n_a_m_e is a register name then the value of the register is
		     obtained from the system header in _c_o_r_f_i_l.  The register
		     names are those printed by the $$rr command.

     _s_y_m_b_o_l	     A _s_y_m_b_o_l is a sequence of upper or lower case letters,
		     underscores or digits, not starting with a digit.	The
		     backslash character \ may be used to escape other charac-
		     ters.  The value of the _s_y_m_b_o_l is taken from the symbol
		     table in _o_b_j_f_i_l.  An initial _ will be prepended to
		     _s_y_m_b_o_l if needed.

     __s_y_m_b_o_l	     In C, the `true name' of an external symbol begins with
		     _.  It may be necessary to utter this name to distinguish
		     it from internal or hidden variables of a program.

     _r_o_u_t_i_n_e._n_a_m_e    The address of the variable _n_a_m_e in the specified C rou-
		     tine.  Both _r_o_u_t_i_n_e and _n_a_m_e are _s_y_m_b_o_l_s.	If _r_o_u_t_i_n_e is
		     omitted, the currently active frame is used.  (This form
		     is currently broken; local variables can be examined only
		     with dbx(1)).  If _n_a_m_e is omitted the value is the ad-
		     dress of the most recently activated C stack frame
		     corresponding to _r_o_u_t_i_n_e (this much works).

     (exp)	     The value of the expression _e_x_p.

  MMoonnaaddiicc OOppeerraattoorrss

	   *_e_x_p                The contents of the location addressed by _e_x_p
			       in _c_o_r_f_i_l.
	   @_e_x_p                The contents of the location addressed by _e_x_p
			       in _o_b_j_f_i_l.
	   -_e_x_p                Integer negation.
	   ~_e_x_p                Bitwise complement.

CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS
     Most commands consist of a verb followed by a modifier or list of modif-
     iers.  The following verbs are available.	(The commands ??  and / may be
     followed by *; see the ADDRESSES section for further details.)

     ??_f    Locations starting at _a_d_d_r_e_s_s in _o_b_j_f_i_l are printed according to
	   the format _f.  _d_o_t is incremented by the sum of the increments for
	   each format letter (q.v.).

     //_f    Locations starting at _a_d_d_r_e_s_s in _c_o_r_f_i_l are printed according to
	   the format _f and _d_o_t is incremented as for ??.

     ==_f    The value of _a_d_d_r_e_s_s itself is printed in the styles indicated by
	   the format _f.  (For _i format zero values are assumed for the parts
	   of the instruction that reference subsequent words.)

     A _f_o_r_m_a_t consists of one or more characters that specify a style of
     printing.	Each format character may be preceded by a decimal integer
     that is a repeat count for the format character.  While stepping through
     a format _d_o_t is incremented by the amount given for each format letter.
     If no format is given then the last format is used.  The format charac-
     ters available are as follows.  Note that a backslash (\) must be used to
     quote the three numeric formats.

	   11  _1      Print 1 byte in the current radix (which may be either
		     signed or unsigned; see the $$dd command).
	   22  _2      Print 2 bytes in the current radix.
	   44  _4      Print 4 bytes in the current radix.
	   vv  _2      Print 2 bytes in the signed variant of the current radix.
	   VV  _4      Print 4 bytes in the signed variant of the current radix.
	   oo  _2      Print 2 bytes in unsigned octal.  All octal numbers
		     output by aaddbb are preceded by 0.
	   OO  _4      Print 4 bytes in unsigned octal.
	   qq  _2      Print 2 bytes in signed octal.
	   QQ  _4      Print 4 bytes in signed octal.
	   uu  _2      Print 2 bytes in unsigned decimal.
	   UU  _4      Print 4 bytes in long unsigned decimal.
	   dd  _2      Print 2 bytes in signed decimal.
	   DD  _4      Print 4 bytes in long signed decimal.
	   xx  _2      Print 2 bytes in unsigned hexadecimal.
	   XX  _4      Print 4 bytes in unsigned hexadecimal.
	   zz  _2      Print 2 bytes in signed hexadecimal.
	   ZZ  _4      Print 4 bytes in signed hexadecimal.
	   ff  _4      Print 4 bytes as a floating point number.
	   FF  _8      Print 8 bytes as a double floating point number.
	   bb  _1      Print 1 byte in unsigned octal.
	   cc  _1      Print 1 byte as a character.
	   CC  _1      Print 1 byte as a character, using the standard escape
		     convention where control characters are printed as ^_X and
		     the delete character is printed as ^?.
	   ss  _n      Print the addressed characters until a zero character is
		     reached.
	   SS  _n      Print a string using the ^_X escape convention (see _C
		     above).  _n is the length of the string including its zero
		     terminator.
	   YY  _4      Print 4 bytes in date format (see ctime(3)).
	   ii  _n      Print as machine instructions.  _n is the number of bytes
		     occupied by the instruction.  This style of printing
		     causes the numeric variables 1, 2, ... to be set accord-
		     ing to the offset parts of the arguments, if any, of the
		     instruction (up to 6 on the VAX).
	   aa  _0      Print the value of _d_o_t in symbolic form.  Symbols are
		     checked to ensure that they have an appropriate type as
		     indicated below.

			   /	  local or global data symbol
			   ?	  local or global text symbol
			   =	  local or global absolute symbol

	   pp  _4      Print the addressed value in symbolic form using the same
		     rules for symbol lookup as aa.
	   tt  _0      When preceded by an integer tabs to the next appropriate
		     tab stop.	For example, 8t moves to the next 8-space tab
		     stop.
	   rr  _0      Print a space.
	   nn  _0      Print a newline.
	   ````......''''   _0
		     Print the enclosed string.
	   ^^	     _D_o_t is decremented by the current increment.  Nothing is
		     printed.
	   ++	     _D_o_t is incremented by 1.  Nothing is printed.
	   --	     _D_o_t is decremented by 1.  Nothing is printed.
	   newline   Repeat the previous command with a _c_o_u_n_t of 1.


     [??//]ll _v_a_l_u_e _m_a_s_k
		 Words starting at _d_o_t are masked with _m_a_s_k and compared with
		 _v_a_l_u_e until a match is found.	If LL is used then the match is
		 for 4 bytes at a time instead of 2.  If no match is found
		 then _d_o_t is unchanged; otherwise _d_o_t is set to the matched
		 location.  If _m_a_s_k is omitted then all bits are compared.

     [??//]ww _v_a_l_u_e ...
		 Write the 2-byte _v_a_l_u_e into the addressed location.  If the
		 command is WW, write 4 bytes.  Odd addresses _a_r_e allowed when
		 writing to the subprocess address space.

     [??//]mm _b_1 _e_1 _f_1[??//]
		 New values for (_b_1, _e_1 are recorded.  If less than three
		 expressions are given then the remaining map parameters are
		 left unchanged.  If the ??  or // is followed by * then the
		 second segment (_b_2, _e_2 of the mapping is changed.  If the
		 list is terminated by ??  or // then the file (_o_b_j_f_i_l or _c_o_r_f_i_l
		 respectively) is used for subsequent requests.  For example,
		 `/m?' will cause // to refer to _o_b_j_f_i_l.

     >>_n_a_m_e	 _D_o_t is assigned to the variable or register named.

     !!		 A shell (/_b_i_n/_s_h) is called to read the rest of the line
		 following !!.

     $$_m_o_d_i_f_i_e_r	 Miscellaneous commands.  The available _m_o_d_i_f_i_e_r_s are:

		 <<_f_i_l_e
		       Read commands from _f_i_l_e If this command is executed in
		       a file, further commands in the file are not seen.  If
		       _f_i_l_e is omitted, the current input stream is terminat-
		       ed.  If a _c_o_u_n_t is given, and is zero, the command will
		       be ignored.  The value of the count will be placed in
		       variable _9 before the first command in _f_i_l_e is execut-
		       ed.

		 <<<<_f_i_l_e
		       Similar to << except it can be used in a file of com-
		       mands without causing the file to be closed.  Variable
		       _9 is saved during the execution of this command, and
		       restored when it completes.  There is a (small) finite
		       limit to the number of <<<< files that can be open at
		       once.

		 >>_f_i_l_e
		       Append output to the file _f_i_l_e, which is created if it
		       does not exist.	If _f_i_l_e is omitted, output is returned
		       to the terminal.

		 ??_f_i_l_e
		       Print process id, the signal which caused stoppage or
		       termination, as well as the registers as $$rr.  This is
		       the default if _m_o_d_i_f_i_e_r is omitted.

		 rr     Print the general registers and the instruction ad-
		       dressed by ppcc.  _D_o_t is set to ppcc.

		 bb     Print all breakpoints and their associated counts and
		       commands.

		 cc     C stack backtrace.  If _a_d_d_r_e_s_s is given then it is tak-
		       en as the address of the current frame instead of the
		       contents of the frame-pointer register.	If CC is used
		       then the names and (32 bit) values of all automatic and
		       static variables are printed for each active function
		       (this is partially broken; the names are not now avail-
		       able).  If _c_o_u_n_t is given then only the first _c_o_u_n_t
		       frames are printed.

		 dd     Set the default radix to _a_d_d_r_e_s_s and report the new
		       value.  If no _a_d_d_r_e_s_s is given, the default radix is
		       not changed.  The new radix must be between -16 (de-
		       cimal) and 16 (decimal) and must not be 0, 1, or -1.  A
		       negative radix implies that numbers printed in that ra-
		       dix will be treated as signed; otherwise they are
		       treated as unsigned.  Note that _a_d_d_r_e_s_s is interpreted
		       in the (old) current radix.  Thus 10$d simply changes
		       the default radix to unsigned.  To make signed decimal
		       the default radix, use -0t10$d.

		 ee     The names and values of external variables are printed.

		 ww     Set the page width for output to _a_d_d_r_e_s_s (default 80).

		 ss     Set the limit for symbol matches to _a_d_d_r_e_s_s (default
		       1024).

		 qq     Exit from aaddbb.

		 vv     Print all non zero variables in octal.

		 mm     Print the address map.

		 pp     (_K_e_r_n_e_l _d_e_b_u_g_g_i_n_g) Change the current kernel memory
		       mapping to map the designated uusseerr ssttrruuccttuurree to the ad-
		       dress given by the symbol __uu.  The _a_d_d_r_e_s_s argument is
		       the address of the user's user page table entries.

     :_m_o_d_i_f_i_e_r	 Manage a subprocess.  Available modifiers are:

		 bb_c    Set breakpoint at _a_d_d_r_e_s_s.  The breakpoint is executed
		       _c_o_u_n_t-_1 times before causing a stop, after which it
		       stops unconditionally.  Each time the breakpoint is en-
		       countered the command _c is executed.  If this command
		       is omitted or sets _d_o_t to zero, the breakpoint causes a
		       stop immediately, regardless of any remaining count.

		 dd     Delete breakpoint at _a_d_d_r_e_s_s.

		 DD     Delete all breakpoints.

		 rr     Run _o_b_j_f_i_l as a subprocess.  If _a_d_d_r_e_s_s is given expli-
		       citly then the program is entered at this point; other-
		       wise the program is entered at its standard entry
		       point.  _c_o_u_n_t specifies how many breakpoints are to be
		       ignored before stopping.  Arguments to the subprocess
		       may be supplied on the same line as the command.  An
		       argument starting with < or > causes the standard input
		       or output to be established for the command.

		 cc_s    The subprocess is continued with signal _s see
		       sigvec(2).  If _a_d_d_r_e_s_s is given then the subprocess is
		       continued at this address.  If no signal is specified
		       then the signal that caused the subprocess to stop is
		       sent.  Breakpoint skipping is the same as for rr.

		 ss_s    As for cc except that the subprocess is single stepped
		       _c_o_u_n_t times.  If there is no current subprocess then
		       _o_b_j_f_i_l is run as a subprocess as for rr.	In this case
		       no signal can be sent; the remainder of the line is
		       treated as arguments to the subprocess.

		 kk     The current subprocess, if any, is terminated.

VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS
     AAddbb provides a number of variables.  Named variables are set initially by
     aaddbb but are not used subsequently.  Numbered variables are reserved for
     communication as follows.

     0	   The last value printed.
     1	   The last offset part of an instruction source.  This continues up
	   through at most 6 on the VAX.  For a three-operand instruction,
	   variable 2 is the second source offset and variable 3 the destina-
	   tion offset part.
     9	   The count on the last $< or $<< command.

     On entry the following are set from the system header in the _c_o_r_f_i_l.  If
     _c_o_r_f_i_l does not appear to be a _c_o_r_e file then these values are set from
     _o_b_j_f_i_l.

     b	   The base address of the data segment.
     d	   The data segment size.
     e	   The entry point.
     m	   The `magic' number (0407, 0410 or 0413).
     s	   The stack segment size.
     t	   The text segment size.

     The address in a file associated with a written address is determined by
     a mapping associated with that file.  Each mapping is represented by two
     triples (_b_1, _e_1 and (_b_2, _e_2 and the _f_i_l_e _a_d_d_r_e_s_s corresponding to a writ-
     ten _a_d_d_r_e_s_s is calculated as follows.

	   _b_1<<==_a_d_d_r_e_s_s<<_e_1 -->> _f_i_l_e _a_d_d_r_e_s_s==_a_d_d_r_e_s_s++_f_1--_b_1, otherwise,

	   _b_2<<==_a_d_d_r_e_s_s<<_e_2 -->> _f_i_l_e _a_d_d_r_e_s_s==_a_d_d_r_e_s_s++_f_2--_b_2,

     otherwise, the requested _a_d_d_r_e_s_s is not legal.  In some cases (e.g. for
     programs with separated I and D space) the two segments for a file may
     overlap.  If a ??  or // is followed by an ** then only the second triple is
     used.

     The initial setting of both mappings is suitable for normal _a._o_u_t and
     _c_o_r_e files.  If either file is not of the kind expected then, for that
     file, _b_1 is set to 0, _e_1 is set to the maximum file size and _f_1 is set to
     0; in this way the whole file can be examined with no address transla-
     tion.
