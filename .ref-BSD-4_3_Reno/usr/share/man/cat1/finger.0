     The ffiinnggeerr command has two basic output formats providing essentially the
     same information.

     Options are:

     --ss    FFiinnggeerr displays the user's login name, real name, terminal name and
	   write status (as a ``*'' after the terminal name if write permis-
	   sion is denied), idle time, login time, office location and office
	   phone number.

	   Idle time is in minutes if it is a single integer, hours and
	   minutes if a ``:'' is present, or days if a ``d'' is present.  Lo-
	   gin time is displayed as month, day, hours and minutes, unless more
	   than six months ago, in which case the year is displayed rather
	   than the hours and minutes.

	   Unknown devices as well as nonexistent idle and login times are
	   displayed as single asterisks.

     --ll    Produces a multi-line format displaying all of the information
	   described for the --ss option as well as the user's home directory,
	   home phone number, login shell, and the contents of the files
	   ``._p_l_a_n'' and ``._p_r_o_j_e_c_t'' from the user's home directory.

	   If idle time is at least a minute and less than a day, it is
	   presented in the form ``hh:mm''.  Idle times greater than a day are
	   presented as ``d day[s]hh:mm''.

	   Phone numbers specified as eleven digits are printed as ``+N-NNN-
	   NNN-NNNN''.	Numbers specified as ten or seven digits are printed
	   as the appropriate subset of that string.  Numbers specified as
	   five digits are printed as ``xN-NNNN''.

	   If write permission is denied to the device, the phrase ``(messages
	   off)'' is appended to the line containing the device name.  One en-
	   try per user is displayed with the --ll option; if a user is logged
	   on multiple times, terminal information is repeated once per login.

     --pp    Prevents the --ll option of ffiinnggeerr from displaying the contents of
	   the ``._p_l_a_n'' and ``._p_r_o_j_e_c_t'' files.

	   Note that some fields may be missing, in either format, if informa-
	   tion is not available for them.

     --mm    Prevent matching of _u_s_e_r names.  _U_s_e_r is usually a login name; how-
	   ever, matching will also be done on the users' real names, unless
	   the --mm option is supplied.  All name matching performed by ffiinnggeerr
	   is case insensitive.

     If no options are specified, ffiinnggeerr defaults to the --ll style output if
     operands are provided, otherwise to the --ss style.

     If no arguments are specified, ffiinnggeerr will print an entry for each user
     currently logged into the system.

     FFiinnggeerr may be used to look up users on a remote machine.  The format is
     to specify a _u_s_e_r as ``user@host'', or ``@host'', where the default out-
     put format for the former is the --ll style, and the default output format
     for the latter is the --ss style.  The --ll option is the only option that
     may be passed to a remote machine.
