     MMoorree is a filter for paging through text one screenful at a time.	It
     uses termcap(3) so it can run on a variety of terminals.  There is even
     limited support for hardcopy terminals.  (On a hardcopy terminal, lines
     which should be printed at the top of the screen are prefixed with an
     up-arrow.) _F_i_l_e may be a single dash (``-''), implying stdin.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     Command line options are described below.	Options are also taken from
     the environment variable MORE (make sure to precede them with a dash
     (``-'')) but command line options will override them.

     --cc        Normally, mmoorree will repaint the screen by scrolling from the
	       bottom of the screen.  If the --cc option is set, when mmoorree needs
	       to change the entire display, it will paint from the top line
	       down.

     --ee        Normally, if displaying a single file, mmoorree exits as soon as it
	       reaches end-of-file.  The --ee option tells more to exit if it
	       reaches end-of-file twice without an intervening operation.  If
	       the file is shorter than a single screen mmoorree will exit at
	       end-of-file regardless.

     --ii        The --ii option causes searches to ignore case; that is, upper-
	       case and lowercase are considered identical.

     --nn        The --nn flag suppresses line numbers.  The default (to use line
	       numbers) may cause mmoorree to run more slowly in some cases, espe-
	       cially with a very large input file.  Suppressing line numbers
	       with the --nn flag will avoid this problem.  Using line numbers
	       means: the line number will be displayed in the == command, and
	       the vv command will pass the current line number to the editor.

     --ss        The --ss option causes consecutive blank lines to be squeezed
	       into a single blank line.

     --tt        The --tt option, followed immediately by a tag, will edit the
	       file containing that tag.  For more information, see the
	       ctags(1) command.

     --uu        By default, mmoorree treats backspaces and CR-LF sequences special-
	       ly.  Backspaces which appear adjacent to an underscore charac-
	       ter are displayed as underlined text.  Backspaces which appear
	       between two identical characters are displayed as emboldened
	       text.  CR-LF sequences are compressed to a single linefeed
	       character.  The --uu option causes backspaces to always be
	       displayed as control characters, i.e. as the two character se-
	       quence ``^H'', and CR-LF to be left alone.

     --xx        The --xx option sets tab stops every _N positions. The default for
	       _N is 8.

     --//        The --// option specifies a string that will be searched for be-
	       fore each file is displayed.

CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS
     Interactive commands for mmoorree are based on vi(1).	Some commands may be
     preceeded by a decimal number, called N in the descriptions below.  In
     the following descriptions, ^X means control-X.
     hh	       help: display a summary of these commands.  If you forget all
	       the other commands, remember this one.

     SSPPAACCEE or ff or ^^FF
	       Scroll forward N lines, default one window.  If N is more than
	       the screen size, only the final screenful is displayed.

     bb or ^^BB   Scroll backward N lines, default one window (see option -z
	       below).	If N is more than the screen size, only the final
	       screenful is displayed.

     jj or RREETTUURRNN
	       Scroll forward N lines, default 1.  The entire N lines are
	       displayed, even if N is more than the screen size.

     kk	       Scroll backward N lines, default 1.  The entire N lines are
	       displayed, even if N is more than the screen size.

     dd or ^^DD   Scroll forward N lines, default one half of the screen size.
	       If N is specified, it becomes the new default for subsequent d
	       and u commands.

     uu or ^^UU   Scroll backward N lines, default one half of the screen size.
	       If N is specified, it becomes the new default for subsequent d
	       and u commands.

     gg	       Go to line N in the file, default 1 (beginning of file).

     GG	       Go to line N in the file, default the end of the file.

     pp or %%    Go to a position N percent into the file.  N should be between
	       0 and 100.  (This works if standard input is being read, but
	       only if mmoorree has already read to the end of the file.  It is
	       always fast, but not always useful.)

     rr or ^^LL   Repaint the screen.

     RR	       Repaint the screen, discarding any buffered input.  Useful if
	       the file is changing while it is being viewed.

     mm	       Followed by any lowercase letter, marks the current position
	       with that letter.

     ''	       (Single quote.) Followed by any lowercase letter, returns to
	       the position which was previously marked with that letter.
	       Followed by another single quote, returns to the postion at
	       which the last "large" movement command was executed, or the
	       beginning of the file if no such movements have occurred.  All
	       marks are lost when a new file is examined.

     //_p_a_t_t_e_r_n
	       Search forward in the file for the N-th line containing the
	       pattern.  N defaults to 1.  The pattern is a regular
	       expression, as recognized by ed.  The search starts at the
	       second line displayed.

     ??_p_a_t_t_e_r_n
	       Search backward in the file for the N-th line containing the
	       pattern.  The search starts at the line immediately before the
	       top line displayed.

     //!!_p_a_t_t_e_r_n
	       Like /, but the search is for the N-th line which does NOT
	       contain the pattern.

     ??!!_p_a_t_t_e_r_n
	       Like ?, but the search is for the N-th line which does NOT
	       contain the pattern.

     nn	       Repeat previous search, for N-th line containing the last pat-
	       tern (or NOT containing the last pattern, if the previous
	       search was /! or ?!).

     EE [_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e]
	       Examine a new file.  If the filename is missing, the "current"
	       file (see the N and P commands below) from the list of files in
	       the command line is re-examined.  If the filename is a pound
	       sign (#), the previously examined file is re-examined.

     NN or ::nn   Examine the next file (from the list of files given in the
	       command line).  If a number N is specified (not to be confused
	       with the command N), the N-th next file is examined.

     PP or ::pp   Examine the previous file.  If a number N is specified, the N-
	       th previous file is examined.

     ::tt        Go to supplied tag.

     vv	       Invokes an editor to edit the current file being viewed.  The
	       editor is taken from the environment variable EDITOR, or de-
	       faults to vi(1).

     == or ^^GG   These options print out the number of the file currently being
	       displayed relative to the total number of files there are to
	       display, the current line number, the current byte number and
	       the total bytes to display, and what percentage of the file has
	       been displayed.	If mmoorree is reading from stdin, or the file is
	       shorter than a single screen, some of these items may not be
	       available.  Note, all of these items reference the first byte
	       of the last line displayed on the screen.

     qq or ::qq or ZZZZ
	       Exits mmoorree.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     MMoorree utilizes the following environment variables, if they exist:

     MORE      This variable may be set with favored options to mmoorree.

     EDITOR    Specify default editor.

     SHELL     Current shell in use (normally set by the shell at login time).

     TERM      Specifies terminal type, used by more to get the terminal
	       characteristics necessary to manipulate the screen.
