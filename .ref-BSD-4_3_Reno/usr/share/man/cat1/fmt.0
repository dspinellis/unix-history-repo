     FFmmtt is a simple text formatter which reads the concatenation of input
     files (or standard input if none are given) and produces on standard out-
     put a version of its input with lines as close to the _g_o_a_l length as pos-
     sible without exceeding the maximum.  The _g_o_a_l length defaults to 65 and
     the maximum to 75.  The spacing at the beginning of the input lines is
     preserved in the output, as are blank lines and interword spacing.

     FFmmtt is meant to format mail messages prior to sending, but may also be
     useful for other simple tasks.  For instance, within visual mode of the
     ex(1) editor (e.g.  vi(1)) the command

	   !}fmt

     will reformat a paragraph, evening the lines.

     The program was designed to be simple and fast - for more complex opera-
     tions, the standard text processors are likely to be more appropriate.
