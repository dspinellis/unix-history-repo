     FFpprr is a filter that transforms files formatted according to Fortran's
     carriage control conventions into files formatted according to UNIX line
     printer conventions.

     FFpprr copies its input onto its output, replacing the carriage control
     characters with characters that will produce the intended effects when
     printed using lpr(1).  The first character of each line determines the
     vertical spacing as follows:

	   Blank	One line

	   0		Two lines
	   1		To first line of next page
	   +		No advance

     A blank line is treated as if its first character is a blank. A blank
     that appears as a carriage control character is deleted. A zero is
     changed to a newline.  A one is changed to a form feed. The effects of a
     "+" are simulated using backspaces.
