     The _k_i_n_i_t command is used to login to the Kerberos authenti-
     cation and authorization system.  Note that only registered
     Kerberos users can use the Kerberos system.  For information
     about registering as a Kerberos user, see the _k_e_r_b_e_r_o_s(_1)
     manual page.

     If you are logged in to a workstation that is running the
     _t_o_e_h_o_l_d service, you do not have to use _k_i_n_i_t. The _t_o_e_h_o_l_d
     login procedure will log you into Kerberos automatically.
     You will need to use _k_i_n_i_t only in those situations in which
     your original tickets have expired.  (Tickets expire in
     about a day.) Note as well that _t_o_e_h_o_l_d will automatically
     destroy your tickets when you logout from the workstation.

     When you use _k_i_n_i_t without options, the utility prompts for
     your username and Kerberos password, and tries to authenti-
     cate your login with the local Kerberos server.

     If Kerberos authenticates the login attempt, _k_i_n_i_t retrieves
     your initial ticket and puts it in the ticket file specified
     by your KRBTKFILE environment variable.  If this variable is
     undefined, your ticket will be stored in the /_t_m_p directory,
     in the file _t_k_t_u_i_d , where _u_i_d specifies your user identifi-
     cation number.

     If you have logged in to Kerberos without the benefit of the
     workstation _t_o_e_h_o_l_d system, make sure you use the _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y
     command to destroy any active tickets before you end your
     login session.  You may want to put the _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y command in
     your ._l_o_g_o_u_t file so that your tickets will be destroyed
     automatically when you logout.

     The options to _k_i_n_i_t are as follows:

     --ii     _k_i_n_i_t prompts you for a Kerberos instance.

     --rr     _k_i_n_i_t prompts you for a Kerberos realm.  This option
	    lets you authenticate yourself with a remote Kerberos
	    server.

     --vv     Verbose mode.  _k_i_n_i_t prints the name of the ticket
	    file used, and a status message indicating the suc-
	    cess or failure of your login attempt.

     --ll     _k_i_n_i_t prompts you for a ticket lifetime in minutes.
