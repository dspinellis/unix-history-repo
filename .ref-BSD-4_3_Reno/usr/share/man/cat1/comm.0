     ccoommmm - Select or reject lines common to two files

     The ccoommmm utility reads _f_i_l_e_1 and _f_i_l_e_2, which should be sorted lexically,
     and produces three text columns as output: lines only in _f_i_l_e_1; lines
     only in _f_i_l_e_2; and lines in both files.

     The filename `--' means the standard input.

     The following options are available:

     --11    Suppress printing of column 1.

     --22    Suppress printing of column 2.

     --33    Suppress printing of column 3.

     Each column will have a number of tab characters prepended to it equal to
     the number of lower numbered columns that are being printed.  For exam-
     ple, if column number two is being suppressed, lines printed in column
     number one will not have any tabs preceding them, and lines printed in
     column number three will have one.

     CCoommmm assumes that the files are lexically sorted; all characters partici-
     pate in line comparisons.

     CCoommmm exits 0 on success, >0 if an error occurred.
