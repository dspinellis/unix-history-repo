     ddeerrooffff - remove nroff, troff, tbl and eqn constructs

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     DDeerrooffff reads each file in sequence and removes all nroff(1) and troff(1)
     command lines, backslash constructions, macro definitions, eqn(1) con-
     structs (between `.EQ' and `.EN' lines or between delimiters), and table
     descriptions and writes the remainder on the standard output.  DDeerrooffff
     follows chains of included files (`.so' and `.nx' commands); if a file
     has already been included, a `.so' is ignored and a `.nx' terminates exe-
     cution.  If no input file is given, ddeerrooffff reads from the standard input
     file.

     If the --ww flag is given, the output is a word list, one `word' (string of
     letters, digits, and apostrophes, beginning with a letter; apostrophes
     are removed) per line, and all other characters ignored.  Otherwise, the
     output follows the original, with the deletions mentioned above.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     DDeerrooffff appeared in Version 7 AT&T Unix.

BBUUGGSS
     DDeerrooffff is not a complete troff(1) interpreter, so it can be confused by
     subtle constructs.  Most errors result in too much rather than too little
     output.
