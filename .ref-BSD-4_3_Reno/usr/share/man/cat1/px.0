     PPxx interprets the abstract machine code generated by pi(1).  The first
     argument is the file to be interpreted, and defaults to _o_b_j; remaining
     arguments are available to the Pascal program using the built-ins _a_r_g_v
     and _a_r_g_c.	PPxx is also invoked by ppiixx when running `load and go'.

     If the program terminates abnormally an error message and a control flow
     backtrace are printed.  The number of statements executed and total exe-
     cution time are printed after normal termination.	The pp option of ppii
     suppresses all of this except the message indicating the cause of abnor-
     mal termination.

     Most run-time error messages are self-explanatory.  Some of the more
     unusual ones are:

     Reference to an inactive file
	   A file other than _i_n_p_u_t or _o_u_t_p_u_t was used before a call to _r_e_s_e_t
	   or _r_e_w_r_i_t_e.

     Statement count limit exceeded
	   The limit of 500,000 executed statements (which prevents excessive
	   looping or recursion) has been exceeded.

     Bad data found on integer read

     Bad data found on real read
	   Usually, non-numeric input was found for a number.  For reals, Pas-
	   cal requires digits before and after the decimal point so that
	   numbers like `.1' or `21.' evoke the second diagnostic.

     panic:
	   _S_o_m_e _m_e_s_s_a_g_e Indicates an internal inconsistency detected in ppxx
	   probably due to a Pascal system bug.

     Post-mortem traceback is not limited; infinite recursion leads to almost
     infinite traceback.
