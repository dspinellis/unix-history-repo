     The ggrroouuppss command shows the groups to which you or the optionally speci-
     fied user belong.	Each user belongs to a group specified in the password
     file /_e_t_c/_p_a_s_s_w_d and possibly to other groups as specified in the file
     /_e_t_c/_g_r_o_u_p.  If you do not own a file but belong to the group which it is
     owned by then you are granted group access to the file.

     When a new file is created it is given the group of the containing direc-
     tory.
