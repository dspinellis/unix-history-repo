     PPttxx generates a permuted index to file _i_n_p_u_t on file _o_u_t_p_u_t (standard in-
     put and output default).  It has three phases: the first does the permu-
     tation, generating one line for each keyword in an input line.  The key-
     word is rotated to the front.  The permuted file is then sorted.  Final-
     ly, the sorted lines are rotated so the keyword comes at the middle of
     the page.	PPttxx produces output in the form:

	   .xx tail before keyword keyword and after head

     where .xx may be an nroff(1) or troff(1) macro for user-defined format-
     ting.  The _b_e_f_o_r_e _k_e_y_w_o_r_d and _k_e_y_w_o_r_d _a_n_d _a_f_t_e_r fields incorporate as
     much of the line as will fit around the keyword when it is printed at the
     middle of the page.  _T_a_i_l and _h_e_a_d, at least one of which is an empty
     string "", are wrapped-around pieces small enough to fit in the unused
     space at the opposite end of the line.  When original text must be dis-
     carded, `/' marks the spot.

     The following options can be applied:

     --ff        Fold upper and lower case letters for sorting.

     --tt        Prepare the output for the phototypesetter; the default line
	       length is 100 characters.

     --ww _n      Use the next argument, _n, as the width of the output line.  The
	       default line length is 72 characters.

     --gg _n      Use the next argument, _n, as the number of characters to allow
	       for each gap among the four parts of the line as finally print-
	       ed.  The default gap is 3 characters.

     --oo _o_n_l_y   Use as keywords only the words given in the _o_n_l_y file.

     --ii _i_g_n_o_r_e
	       Do not use as keywords any words given in the ignore file.  If
	       the --ii and --oo options are missing, use /_u_s_r/_s_h_a_r_e/_d_i_c_t/_e_i_g_n as
	       the ignore file.

     --bb _b_r_e_a_k
	       Use the characters in the break file to separate words.	In any
	       case, tab, newline, and space characters are always used as
	       break characters.

     --rr        Take any leading nonblank characters of each input line to be a
	       reference identifier (as to a page or chapter) separate from
	       the text of the line.  Attach that identifier as a 5th field on
	       each output line.

     The index for this manual was generated using ppttxx.
