     _T_r copies the standard input to the standard output with
     substitution or deletion of selected characters.  Input
     characters found in _s_t_r_i_n_g_1 are mapped into the correspond-
     ing characters of _s_t_r_i_n_g_2.  When _s_t_r_i_n_g_2 is short it is pad-
     ded to the length of _s_t_r_i_n_g_1 by duplicating its last charac-
     ter.  Any combination of the options --ccddss may be used: --cc
     complements the set of characters in _s_t_r_i_n_g_1 with respect to
     the universe of characters whose ASCII codes are 0 through
     0377 octal; --dd deletes all input characters in _s_t_r_i_n_g_1; --ss
     squeezes all strings of repeated output characters that are
     in _s_t_r_i_n_g_2 to single characters.

     In either string the notation _a--_b means a range of charac-
     ters from _a to _b in increasing ASCII order.  The character
     `\' followed by 1, 2 or 3 octal digits stands for the char-
     acter whose ASCII code is given by those digits.  A `\' fol-
     lowed by any other character stands for that character.

     The following example creates a list of all the words in
     `file1', each on a separate line, in `file2', where a word
     is taken to be a string of alphabetics.  The second string
     is quoted to protect `\' from the Shell.  012 is the ASCII
     code for newline.

	  tr -cs A-Za-z '\012' <file1 >file2
