SLEEP(1)		    UNIX Reference Manual		      SLEEP(1)

NNAAMMEE
     sslleeeepp - suspend execution for an interval of time

     The sslleeeepp command suspends execution for a minimum of _s_e_c_o_n_d_s.  SSlleeeepp is
     used to schedule the execution of other commands (see EXAMPLES below).

     The SSlleeeepp utility exits with one of the following values:

     0	   On successful completetion, or if the signal SIGALRM was received.

     >0    An error occurred.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
     To schedule the execution of a command for _x number seconds later:

	   (sleep 1800; sh command_file >& errors)&

     This incantation would wait a half hour before running the script
     command_file. (See the at(1) utility.)

     To reiteratively run a command (with the csh(1)):

	   while (1)
		if (! -r zzz.rawdata) then
		     sleep 300
		else
		     foreach i (`ls *.rawdata`)
			  sleep 70
			  awk -f collapse_data $i >> results
		     end
		     break
		endif
	   end

     The scenario for a script such as this might be: a program currently run-
     ning is taking longer than expected to process a series of files, and it
     would be nice to have another program start processing the files created
     by the first program as soon as it is finished (when zzz.rawdata is
     created).	The script checks every five minutes for the file zzz.rawdata,
     when the file is found, then another portion processing is done curteous-
     ly by sleeping for 70 seconds in between each awk job.

     The sleep function is expected to be POSIX 1003.2 compatible.
