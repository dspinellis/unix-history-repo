     The ccuutt utility selects portions of each line (as specified by _l_i_s_t) from
     each _f_i_l_e (or the standard input by default), and writes them to the
     standard output.  The items specified by _l_i_s_t can be in terms of column
     position or in terms of fields delimited by a special character. Column
     numbering starts from 1.

     _L_i_s_t is a comma or whitespace separated set of increasing numbers and/or
     number ranges.  Number ranges consist of a number, a dash (``-''), and a
     second number and select the fields or columns from the first number to
     the second, inclusive.  Numbers or number ranges may be preceded by a
     dash, which selects all fields or columns from 1 to the first number.
     Numbers or number ranges may be followed by a dash, which selects all
     fields or columns from the last number to the end of the line.  Numbers
     and number ranges may be repeated, overlapping, and in any order.	It is
     not an error to select fields or columns not present in the input line.

     The options are as follows:

     --cc _l_i_s_t   The _l_i_s_t specifies character positions.

     --ff _l_i_s_t   The _l_i_s_t specifies fields, delimited in the input by a single
	       tab character.  Output fields are separated by a single tab
	       character.

     --dd _c_h_a_r   Use _c_h_a_r as the field delimiter character instead of the tab
	       character.

     --ss        Suppresses lines with no field delimiter characters.  Unless
	       specified, lines with no delimiters are passed through unmodi-
	       fied.

     CCuutt exits 0 on success, 1 if an error occurred.
