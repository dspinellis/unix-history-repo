     CCoollccrrtt provides virtual half-line and reverse line feed sequences for
     terminals without such capability, and on which overstriking is destruc-
     tive.  Half-line characters and underlining (changed to dashing `-') are
     placed on new lines in between the normal output lines.

     --	   Suppress all underlining.  It is especially useful for previewing
	   _a_l_l_b_o_x_e_d tables from tbl(1).

     --22    Causes all half-lines to be printed, effectively double spacing the
	   output.  Normally, a minimal space output format is used which will
	   suppress empty lines.  The program never suppresses two consecutive
	   empty lines, however.  The --22 option is useful for sending output
	   to the line printer when the output contains superscripts and sub-
	   scripts which would otherwise be invisible.

     A typical use of ccoollccrrtt would be

	   tbl exum2.n | nroff -ms | colcrt - |

     Should fold underlines onto blanks even with the `--' option so that a
     true underline character would show; if we did this, however, ccoollccrrtt
     wouldn't get rid of _c_u'_d underlining completely.

     Can't back up more than 102 lines.

     General overstriking is lost; as a special case `|' overstruck with `-'
     or underline becomes `+'.

     Lines are trimmed to 132 characters.

     Some provision should be made for processing superscripts and subscripts
     in documents which are already double-spaced.
