     The llnn utility creates a new directory entry (linked file) which inherits
     the same modes as the orginal file.  It is useful for maintaining multi-
     ple copies of a file in many places at once - without the `copies'; in-
     stead, a link `points' to the original copy.  There are two types of
     links; hard links and symbolic links.  How a link `points' to a file is
     one of the differences between a hard or symbolic link.

     Option available:

     --ss    Create a symbolic link.

     By default llnn makes _h_a_r_d links.  A hard link to a file is indistinguish-
     able from the original directory entry; any changes to a file are effec-
     tive independent of the name used to reference the file.  Hard links may
     not refer to directories (unless the proper incantations are supplied)
     and may not span file systems.

     A symbolic link contains the name of the file to which it is linked.  The
     referenced file is used when an open(2) operation is performed on the
     link.  A stat(2) on a symbolic link will return the linked-to file; an
     lstat(2) must be done to obtain information about the link.  The
     readlink(2) call may be used to read the contents of a symbolic link.
     Symbolic links may span file systems and may refer to directories.

     Given one or two arguments, llnn creates a link to an existing file
     _s_o_u_r_c_e__f_i_l_e.  If _t_a_r_g_e_t__f_i_l_e is given, the link has that name;
     _t_a_r_g_e_t__f_i_l_e may also be a directory in which to place the link; otherwise
     it is placed in the current directory.  If only the directory is speci-
     fied, the link will be made to the last component of _s_o_u_r_c_e__f_i_l_e.

     Given more than two arguments, llnn makes links in _t_a_r_g_e_t__d_i_r to all the
     named source files.  The links made will have the same name as the files
     being linked to.
