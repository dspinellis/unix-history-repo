     _S_t_a_t obtains information about the file _p_a_t_h.  Read, write
     or execute permission of the named file is not required, but
     all directories listed in the path name leading to the file
     must be reachable.

     _L_s_t_a_t is like _s_t_a_t except in the case where the named file
     is a symbolic link, in which case _l_s_t_a_t returns information
     about the link, while _s_t_a_t returns information about the
     file the link references.

     _F_s_t_a_t obtains the same information about an open file refer-
     enced by the argument descriptor, such as would be obtained
     by an _o_p_e_n call.

     _B_u_f is a pointer to a _s_t_a_t structure into which information
     is placed concerning the file.  The contents of the struc-
     ture pointed to by _b_u_f:

	 struct stat {
	     dev_t    st_dev;	   /* device inode resides on */
	     ino_t    st_ino;	   /* inode's number */
	     u_short  st_mode;	   /* inode protection mode */
	     short    st_nlink;    /* number or hard links to the file */
	     uid_t    st_uid;	   /* user-id of owner */
	     gid_t    st_gid;	   /* group-id of owner */
	     dev_t    st_rdev;	   /* device type, for special file inode */
	     off_t    st_size;	   /* file size, in bytes */
	     time_t   st_atime;    /* time of last access */
	     int      st_spare1;
	     time_t   st_mtime;    /* time of last data modification */
	     int      st_spare2;
	     time_t   st_ctime;    /* time of last file status change */

	     u_long   st_gen;	   /* file generation number */
	 };

     st_atime
	  Time when file data was last accessed.  Changed by the
	  following system calls: _m_k_n_o_d(2), _u_t_i_m_e_s(2), and
	  _r_e_a_d(2).  For reasons of efficiency, st_atime is not
	  set when a directory is searched, although this would
	  be more logical.

     st_mtime
	  Time when data was last modified.  It is not set by
	  changes of owner, group, link count, or mode.  Changed
	  by the following system calls: _m_k_n_o_d(2), _u_t_i_m_e_s(2),
	  _w_r_i_t_e(2).

     st_ctime
	  Time when file status was last changed.  It is set both
	  both by writing and changing the i-node.  Changed by
	  the following system calls: _c_h_m_o_d(2) _c_h_o_w_n(2), _l_i_n_k(2),
	  _m_k_n_o_d(2), _r_e_n_a_m_e(2), _u_n_l_i_n_k(2), _u_t_i_m_e_s(2), _w_r_i_t_e(2).

     st_blocks
	  The actual number of blocks allocated for the file in
	  512-byte units.

     The status information word _s_t__m_o_d_e has bits:
	  #define S_IFMT  0170000  /* type of file */
	  #define    S_IFDIR	   0040000/* directory */
	  #define    S_IFCHR	   0020000/* character special */
	  #define    S_IFBLK	   0060000/* block special */
	  #define    S_IFREG	   0100000/* regular */
	  #define    S_IFLNK	   0120000/* symbolic link */
	  #define    S_IFSOCK	   0140000/* socket */
	  #define S_ISUID 0004000  /* set user id on execution */
	  #define S_ISGID 0002000  /* set group id on execution */
	  #define S_ISVTX 0001000  /* save swapped text even after use */
	  #define S_IREAD 0000400  /* read permission, owner */
	  #define S_IWRITE	   0000200/* write permission, owner */
	  #define S_IEXEC 0000100  /* execute/search permission, owner */

     The mode bits 0000070 and 0000007 encode group and others
     permissions (see _c_h_m_o_d(2)).

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEE
     Upon successful completion a value of 0 is returned.  Other-
     wise, a value of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate
     the error.

EERRRROORRSS
     _S_t_a_t and _l_s_t_a_t will fail if one or more of the following are
     true:

     [ENOTDIR]	    A component of the path prefix is not a
		    directory.

     [EINVAL]	    The pathname contains a character with the
		    high-order bit set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG] A component of a pathname exceeded 255 char-
		    acters, or an entire path name exceeded 1023
		    characters.

     [ENOENT]	    The named file does not exist.

     [EACCES]	    Search permission is denied for a component
		    of the path prefix.

     [ELOOP]	    Too many symbolic links were encountered in
		    translating the pathname.

     [EFAULT]	    _B_u_f or _n_a_m_e points to an invalid address.

     [EIO]	    An I/O error occurred while reading from or
		    writing to the file system.

     _F_s_t_a_t will fail if one or both of the following are true:

     [EBADF]	    _F_i_l_d_e_s is not a valid open file descriptor.

     [EFAULT]	    _B_u_f points to an invalid address.

     [EIO]	    An I/O error occurred while reading from or
		    writing to the file system.

     The fields in the stat structure currently marked _s_t__s_p_a_r_e_1,
     _s_t__s_p_a_r_e_2, and _s_t__s_p_a_r_e_3 are present in preparation for
     inode time stamps expanding to 64 bits.  This, however, can
     break certain programs that depend on the time stamps being
     contiguous (in calls to _u_t_i_m_e_s(2)).

     chmod(2), chown(2), utimes(2)

BBUUGGSS
     Applying _f_s_t_a_t to a socket (and thus to a pipe) returns a
     zero'd buffer, except for the blocksize field, and a unique
     device and inode number.
