     _R_e_b_o_o_t reboots the system.  Only the super-user may reboot a
     machine on demand.  However, a reboot is invoked automati-
     cally in the event of unrecoverable system failures.

     _H_o_w_t_o is a mask of options; the system call interface passes
     the following options, defined in the include file
     ``<sys/reboot.h>'', to be passed to the new kernel or the
     new bootstrap and init programs.

     RB_AUTOBOOT
	  The default, causing the system to reboot in its usual
	  fashion.

     RB_ASKNAME
	  Interpreted by the bootstrap program itself, causing it
	  to prompt on the console as to what file should be
	  booted.  Normally, the system is booted from the file
	  ``_x_x(0,0)vmunix'', where _x_x is the default disk name,
	  without prompting for the file name.

     RB_DFLTROOT
	  Use the compiled in root device.  Normally, the system
	  uses the device from which it was booted as the root
	  device if possible.  (The default behavior is dependent
	  on the ability of the bootstrap program to determine
	  the drive from which it was loaded, which is not possi-
	  ble on all systems.)

     RB_DUMP
	  Dump kernel memory before rebooting; see _s_a_v_e_c_o_r_e(8)
	  for more information.

     RB_HALT
	  the processor is simply halted; no reboot takes place.
	  This option should be used with caution.

     RB_INITNAME
	  An option allowing the specification of an init program
	  (see _i_n_i_t(8) other than ``/sbin/init'' to be run when
	  the system reboots.  This switch is not currently
	  available.

     RB_KDB
	  Load the symbol table and enable a built-in debugger in
	  the system.  This option will have no useful function
	  if the kernel is not configured for debugging.  Several
	  other options have different meaning if combined with
	  this option, although their use may not be possible via
	  the _r_e_b_o_o_t call.  See _k_a_d_b(4) for more information.

     RB_NOSYNC
	  Normally, the disks are sync'd (see _s_y_n_c(8)) before the
	  processor is halted or rebooted.  This option may be
	  useful if file system changes have been made manually
	  or if the processor is on fire.

     RB_RDONLY
	  Initially mount the root file system read-only.  This
	  is currently the default, and this option has been
	  deprecated as a no-op.

     RB_SINGLE
	  Normally, the reboot procedure involves an automatic
	  disk consistency check and then multi-user operations.
	  RB_SINGLE prevents this, booting the system with a
	  single-user shell on the console.  RB_SINGLE is actu-
	  ally interpreted by the _i_n_i_t(8) program in the newly
	  booted system.

     When no options are given (i.e., RB_AUTOBOOT is used), the
     system is rebooted from file ``vmunix'' in the root file
     system of unit 0 of a disk chosen in a processor specific
     way.  An automatic consistency check of the disks is then
     normally performed (see _f_s_c_k(8)).

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEESS
     If successful, this call never returns.  Otherwise, a -1 is
     returned and an error is returned in the global variable
     _e_r_r_n_o.

EERRRROORRSS
     [EPERM]	    The caller is not the super-user.

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
     kadb(4), crash(8), halt(8), init(8), reboot(8), savecore(8)

BBUUGGSS
     The HP300 implementation supports neither RB_DFLTROOT or
     RB_KDB.
