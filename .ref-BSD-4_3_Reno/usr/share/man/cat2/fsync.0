     fsync - synchronize a file's in-core state with that on disk

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     _F_s_y_n_c causes all modified data and attributes of _f_d to be
     moved to a permanent storage device.  This normally results
     in all in-core modified copies of buffers for the associated
     file to be written to a disk.

     _F_s_y_n_c should be used by programs that require a file to be
     in a known state, for example, in building a simple transac-
     tion facility.

     A 0 value is returned on success.	A -1 value indicates an
     error.

EERRRROORRSS
     The _f_s_y_n_c fails if:

     [EBADF]	    _F_d is not a valid descriptor.

     [EINVAL]	    _F_d refers to a socket, not to a file.

     [EIO]	    An I/O error occurred while reading from or
		    writing to the file system.
