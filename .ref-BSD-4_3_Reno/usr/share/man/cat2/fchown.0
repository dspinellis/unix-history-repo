     The file that is named by _p_a_t_h or referenced by _f_d has its
     _o_w_n_e_r and _g_r_o_u_p changed as specified.  Only the super-user
     may change the owner of the file, because if users were able
     to give files away, they could defeat the file-space
     accounting procedures.  The owner of the file may change the
     group to a group of which he is a member.

     On some systems, _c_h_o_w_n clears the set-user-id and set-
     group-id bits on the file to prevent accidental creation of
     set-user-id and set-group-id programs.

     _F_c_h_o_w_n is particularly useful when used in conjunction with
     the file locking primitives (see _f_l_o_c_k(2)).

     One of the owner or group id's may be left unchanged by
     specifying it as -1.

     If the final component of _p_a_t_h is a symbolic link, the own-
     ership and group of the symbolic link is changed, not the
     ownership and group of the file or directory to which it
     points.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEE
     Zero is returned if the operation was successful; -1 is
     returned if an error occurs, with a more specific error code
     being placed in the global variable _e_r_r_n_o.

EERRRROORRSS
     _C_h_o_w_n will fail and the file will be unchanged if:

     [ENOTDIR]	    A component of the path prefix is not a
		    directory.

     [EINVAL]	    The pathname contains a character with the
		    high-order bit set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG] A component of a pathname exceeded 255 char-
		    acters, or an entire path name exceeded 1023
		    characters.

     [ENOENT]	    The named file does not exist.

     [EACCES]	    Search permission is denied for a component

     [ELOOP]	    Too many symbolic links were encountered in

     [EINVAL]	    _F_d refers to a socket, not a file.

     [EPERM]	    The effective user ID is not the super-user.

     [EROFS]	    The named file resides on a read-only file
