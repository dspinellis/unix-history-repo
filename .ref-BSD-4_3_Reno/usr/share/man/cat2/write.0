     _W_r_i_t_e attempts to write _n_b_y_t_e_s of data to the object refer-
     enced by the descriptor _d from the buffer pointed to by _b_u_f.
     _W_r_i_t_e_v performs the same action, but gathers the output data
     from the _i_o_v_c_n_t buffers specified by the members of the _i_o_v
     array: iov[0], iov[1], ..., iov[iovcnt-1].

     For _w_r_i_t_e_v, the _i_o_v_e_c structure is defined as

	  struct iovec {
	       caddr_t	 iov_base;
	       int  iov_len;
	  };

     Each _i_o_v_e_c entry specifies the base address and length of an
     area in memory from which data should be written.	_W_r_i_t_e_v
     will always write a complete area before proceeding to the
     next.

     On objects capable of seeking, the _w_r_i_t_e starts at a posi-
     tion given by the pointer associated with _d, see _l_s_e_e_k(2).
     Upon return from _w_r_i_t_e, the pointer is incremented by the
     number of bytes actually written.

     Objects that are not capable of seeking always write from
     the current position.  The value of the pointer associated
     with such an object is undefined.

     If the real user is not the super-user, then _w_r_i_t_e clears
     the set-user-id bit on a file.  This prevents penetration of
     system security by a user who "captures" a writable set-
     user-id file owned by the super-user.

     When using non-blocking I/O on objects such as sockets that
     are subject to flow control, _w_r_i_t_e and _w_r_i_t_e_v may write

     fewer bytes than requested; the return value must be noted,
     and the remainder of the operation should be retried when
     possible.

     Upon successful completion the number of bytes actually
     written is returned.  Otherwise a -1 is returned and the
     global variable _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the error.

     _W_r_i_t_e and _w_r_i_t_e_v will fail and the file pointer will remain
     unchanged if one or more of the following are true:

     [EBADF]	    _D is not a valid descriptor open for writing.

     [EPIPE]	    An attempt is made to write to a pipe that is
		    not open for reading by any process.

     [EPIPE]	    An attempt is made to write to a socket of
		    type SOCK_STREAM that is not connected to a
		    peer socket.

     [EFBIG]	    An attempt was made to write a file that
		    exceeds the process's file size limit or the
		    maximum file size.

     [EFAULT]	    Part of _i_o_v or data to be written to the file
		    points outside the process's allocated
		    address space.

     [EINVAL]	    The pointer associated with _d was negative.

     [ENOSPC]	    There is no free space remaining on the file
		    system containing the file.

     [EDQUOT]	    The user's quota of disk blocks on the file
		    system containing the file has been
		    exhausted.

     [EIO]	    An I/O error occurred while reading from or
		    writing to the file system.

     [EWOULDBLOCK]  The file was marked for non-blocking I/O, and
		    no data could be written immediately.

     In addition, _w_r_i_t_e_v may return one of the following errors:

     [EINVAL]	    _I_o_v_c_n_t was less than or equal to 0, or
		    greater than 16.

     [EINVAL]	    One of the _i_o_v__l_e_n values in the _i_o_v array
		    was negative.

WRITE(2)		      1986			 WRITE(2)



     [EINVAL]	    The sum of the _i_o_v__l_e_n values in the _i_o_v
		    array overflowed a 32-bit integer.
