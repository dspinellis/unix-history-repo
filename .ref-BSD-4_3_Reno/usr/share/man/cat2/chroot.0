     _D_i_r_n_a_m_e is the address of the pathname of a directory, ter-
     minated by a null byte.  _C_h_r_o_o_t causes this directory to
     become the root directory, the starting point for path names
     beginning with ``/''.

     In order for a directory to become the root directory a pro-
     cess must have execute (search) access to the directory.

     It should be noted that _c_h_r_o_o_t has no effect on the
     process's current directory.

     This call is restricted to the super-user.

     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Oth-
     erwise, a value of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indi-
     cate an error.

     _C_h_r_o_o_t will fail and the root directory will be unchanged if
     one or more of the following are true:

     [ENOTDIR]	    A component of the path name is not a direc-
		    tory.

     [EINVAL]	    The pathname contains a character with the
		    high-order bit set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG] A component of a pathname exceeded 255 char-
		    acters, or an entire path name exceeded 1023
		    characters.

     [ENOENT]	    The named directory does not exist.

     [EACCES]	    Search permission is denied for any component
		    of the path name.

     [ELOOP]	    Too many symbolic links were encountered in
		    translating the pathname.

     [EFAULT]	    _P_a_t_h points outside the process's allocated
		    address space.

     [EIO]	    An I/O error occurred while reading from or
