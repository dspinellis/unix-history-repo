     _E_x_p_o_r_t_s specifies remote mount points for the NFS mount pro-
     tocol per the NFS server specification; see ``Network File
     System Protocol Specification, RFC1094''.

     Each line in the file specifies one remote mount point.  The
     first field is the mount point directory path followed
     optionally by export options and specific hosts separated by
     white space.  Only the first entry for a given local file
     system may specify the export options, since these are han-
     dled on a _p_e_r _l_o_c_a_l _f_i_l_e _s_y_s_t_e_m basis.  If no specific hosts
     are specified, the mount point is exported to all hosts.

     The export options are as follows: --rroooott==<<uuiidd>> specifies how
     to map root's uid (default -2).  The option --rr is synonyms
     for --rroooott in an effort to be backward compatible with older
     export file formats.

     --rroo specifies that the file system should be exported Read-
     only (default Read/Write).  The option --oo is synonyms for
     --rroo in an effort to be backward compatible with older export
     file formats.

     For example:
	  /usr -root=0 rickers snowhite.cis.uoguelph.ca
	  /usr/local 131.104.48.16
	  /u -root=5
	  /u2 -ro

     given that //uussrr, //uu and //uu22 are local file system mount
     points, specifies the following:
	  //uussrr is exported to hosts _r_i_c_k_e_r_s and
	  _s_n_o_w_h_i_t_e._c_i_s._u_o_g_u_e_l_p_h._c_a with root mapped to root.
	  //uussrr//llooccaall is exported to host _1_3_1._1_0_4._4_8._1_6 with root
	  mapped to root.
	  //uu is exported to all hosts with root mapped to uid 5.
	  //uu22 is exported to all hosts Read-only with root mapped
	  to -2.

     Note that //uussrr//llooccaall --rroooott==55 would have been incorrect,
     since //uussrr and //uussrr//llooccaall reside in the same local file sys-
     tem.

     It would be nice if the export options were not tied to
     local mount points.
