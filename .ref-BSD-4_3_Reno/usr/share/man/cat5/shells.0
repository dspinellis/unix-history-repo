DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The _s_h_e_l_l_s file contains a list of the shells on the system.
     For each shell a single line should be present, consisting
     of the shell's path, relative to root.

     A hash mark (``#'') indicates the beginning of a comment;
     subsequent characters up to the end of the line are not
     interpreted by the routines which search the file.  Blank
     lines are also ignored.
