     cpio - format of cpio archive

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The header structure, when the -c option of cpio(1) is not
     used, is:

	  struct {
	       short	 h_magic,
			 h_dev;
	       ushort	 h_ino,
			 h_mode,
			 h_uid,
			 h_gid;
	       short	 h_nlink,
			 h_rdev,
			 h_mtime[2],
			 h_namesize,
			 h_filesize[2];
	       char h_name[h_namesize rounded to word];
	  } Hdr;


     When the -c option is used, the header information is described by:

	  sscanf(Chdr,"%6o%6o%6o%6o%6o%6o%6o%6o%11lo%6o%11lo%s",
	       &Hdr.h_magic, &Hdr.h_dev, &Hdr.h_ino, &Hdr.h_mode,
	       &Hdr.h_uid, &Hdr.h_gid, &Hdr.h_nlink, &Hdr.h_rdev,
	       &Longtime, &Hdr.h_namesize,&Longfile,Hdr.h_name);

     Longtime and Longfile are equivalent to Hdr.h_mtime and
     Hdr.h_filesize, respectively.  The contents of each file are
     recorded in an element of the array of varying lenght struc-
     tures, archive, together with other items describing the
     file.  Every instance of h_magic contains the constant
     070707 (octal).  The itimes h_dev through h_mtime have mean-
     ings explained in stat(2).  The length of the null- ter-
     minated path name H_name, icluding the null byte, is given
     by h_namesize.

     The last record of the archive always contains the name
     TRAILER!!!.  Special files, directories, and the trailer are
     recorded with H_filesize equal to zero.
