     _k_r_b._r_e_a_l_m_s provides a translation from a hostname to the
     Kerberos realm name for the services provided by that host.

     Each line of the translation file is in one of the following
     forms (domain_name should be of the form .XXX.YYY, e.g.
     .LCS.MIT.EDU):
	  host_name kerberos_realm
	  domain_name kerberos_realm
     If a hostname exactly matches the _h_o_s_t__n_a_m_e field in a line
     of the first form, the corresponding realm is the realm of
     the host.	If a hostname does not match any _h_o_s_t__n_a_m_e in the
     file, but its domain exactly matches the _d_o_m_a_i_n__n_a_m_e field
     in a line of the second form, the corresponding realm is the
     realm of the host.

     If no translation entry applies, the host's realm is con-
     sidered to be the hostname's domain portion converted to
     upper case.
