     tc - HP98544-98550 ``Topcat'' and ``Catseye'' device inter-
     face

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     This driver is for the HP98544, 98545 and 98547 ``Topcat''
     and HP98548, 98549, and 98550 ``Catseye'' display cards.
     This driver merely checks for the existence of the device
     and does minimal set up, as it is expected the applications
     will initialize the device to their requirements.	The Top-
     cat and Catseye are nearly identical in common usage and
     only the Topcat will be referred to from now on.

     The Topcat display cards are not user configurable.  If one
     is present on a system, it will always have a frame buffer
     address of 0x200000 and a control register address of
     0x560000.	These are the HP series 300 ITE (Internal Termi-
     nal Emulator) defaults.  The device can also be used as a
     graphics output device.

     The _i_o_c_t_l(2) calls supported by the BSD system for the Top-
     cat are:

     GRFIOCGINFO
	  Get Graphics Info

	  Get info about device, setting the entries in the
	  _g_r_f_i_n_f_o structure, as defined in <hpdev/grfioctl.h>.
	  For the 98544 or 98549, the number of planes should be
	  1, as they are monochrome devices.  The number of
	  planes for a 98545 is 4, translating to 15 colors,
	  excluding black.  The 98547 and 98548 cards have 6
	  planes, yielding 63 colors and black.  The 98550 has 8
	  planes, yielding 255 colors and black.  The displayed
	  frame buffer size for the 98549 and 98550 is 2048 x
	  1024, for the others it is 1024 x 768.

     GRFIOCON
	  Graphics On

	  Turn graphics on by enabling CRT output.  The screen
	  will come on, displaying whatever is in the frame
	  buffer, using whatever colormap is in place.

     GRFIOCOFF
	  Graphics Off

	  Turn graphics off by disabling output to the CRT.  The
	  frame buffer contents are not affected.

     GRFIOCMAP
	  Map Device to user space

	  Map in control registers and framebuffer space. Once
	  the device file is mapped, the frame buffer structure
	  is accessible.  The frame buffer structure describing
	  Topcat/Catseye devices is defined in
	  <hpdev/grf_tcreg.h>.

     page.

     A small example of opening, mapping and using the device is
     given below.  For more examples of the details on the
     behavior of the device, see the device dependent source
     files for the X Window System, in the /_u_s_r/_s_r_c/_n_e_w/_X/_l_i_b_h_p
     directory.

		disp_fd = open("/dev/grf0",1);

		     (void) ioctl (disp_fd, GRFIOCOFF, 0);
		     return -1;
		}
		tc = (tcboxfb *) Addr;				/* Control Registers   */
		frame_buffer = (u_char *) Addr + gi.gd_regsize; /* Frame buffer memory */
