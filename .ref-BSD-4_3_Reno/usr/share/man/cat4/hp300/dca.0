     The 98644A is a single port EIA RS-232C (CCITT V.28) commun-
     ications interface with a single character buffer.  Such an
     interface is built-in to all series 300 machines.

     Each 98644A line behaves as described in _t_t_y(4).  Input and
     output for each line may set to one of following baud rates;
     50, 75, 110, 134.5, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800,
     9600, 19200. See _t_t_y(4) for the encoding.

     Flags should be set to 1 if the line should be treated as
     hard-wired with carrier always present or 0 if modem control
     is desired.

BBUUGGSS
     Data loss is possible on busy systems with baud rates
     greater than 300.	The _d_c_a has never been tested with modem
     control enabled or on anything but the built-in interface.
