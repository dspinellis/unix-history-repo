     The 98628A is a buffered EIA RS-232C (CCITT V.28) communica-
     tions interface.  It has one port with full modem control.

     Each line attached to the 98628A behaves as described in
     _t_t_y(4).  Input and output for each line may set to one of
     following baud rates; 0, 50, 75, 110, 134.5, 150, 200, 300,
     600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200. See _t_t_y(4) for the
     encoding.

     _F_l_a_g_s should be set to 1 if the line should be treated as
     hard-wired with carrier always present, or to 0 if modem
     control is desired.

     Use HP cable "98626 & 98628 opts.002, RS232-C DCE CABLE,
     5061-4216" to attach non-modem devices.  Use HP cable "98626
     & 98628 opts.001, RS232-C DTE CABLE, 5061-4215" to attach
     modems.

     The 98628A has a 256 byte input silo and a 256 output silo.
     Input interrupts happen on a per character basis.

     The high water and low water marks in the kernel tty rou-
     tines are totally inappropriate for a device like this with
     a large input buffer.  Don't use tandem mode if possible.	A
     fast system can handle input at 19.2K baud without receive
     overflow.

     For output to devices that make heavy use of XON/XOFF a
     write size of less then 256 will improve performance margi-
     nally.

     Breaks received at a faster rate then 1 break every second
     will be recognized as a single break.

     Console use is not supported.

     The RS-422/423/499, MTS-DSN/DL modes of the card are not
     supported.
