     The tm-11/te-10 combination provides a standard tape drive
     interface as described in _m_t_i_o(4).  Hardware implementing
     this on the VAX is typified by the Emulex TC-11 controller
     operating with a Kennedy model 9300 tape transport, provid-
     ing 800 and 1600 bpi operation at 125 ips.

     ttee%%dd:: nnoo wwrriittee rriinngg.  An attempt was made to write on the
     tape drive when no write ring was present; this message is
     written on the terminal of the user who tried to access the
     tape.

     ttee%%dd:: nnoott oonnlliinnee.	An attempt was made to access the tape
     while it was offline; this message is written on the termi-
     nal of the user who tried to access the tape.

     to write on a tape at a different density than is already
     recorded on the tape.  This message is written on the termi-
     nal of the user who tried to switch the density.

     ttee%%dd:: hhaarrdd eerrrroorr bbnn%%dd eerr==%%bb.   A tape error occurred at
     block _b_n; the tm error register is printed in octal with the
     bits symbolically decoded.  Any error is fatal on non-raw
     tape; when possible the driver will have retried the opera-
     tion which failed several times before reporting the error.

     ttee%%dd:: lloosstt iinntteerrrruupptt.  A tape operation did not complete
     within a reasonable time, most likely because the tape was
     taken off-line during rewind or lost vacuum.  The controller
     should, but does not, give an interrupt in these cases.  The
     device will be made available again after this message, but
     any current open reference to the device will return an
     error as the operation in progress aborts.

BBUUGGSS
     If any non-data error is encountered on non-raw tape, it
     refuses to do anything more until closed.
