     The _p_s driver provides access to an Evans and Sutherland
     Picture System 2 graphics device.	Each minor device is a
     new PS2.  When the device is opened, its interface registers
     are mapped, via virtual memory, into a user process's
     address space.  This allows the user process very high
     bandwidth to the device with no system call overhead.

     DMA to and from the PS2 is not supported. All read and write
     system calls will fail.  All data is moved to and from the
     PS2 via programmed I/O using the device's interface regis-
     ters.

     Commands are fed to and from the driver using the following
     ioctls:

     PSIOGETADDR
	  Returns the virtual address through which the user pro-
	  cess can access the device's interface registers.

     PSIOAUTOREFRESH
	  Start auto refreshing the screen.  The argument is an
	  address in user space where the following data resides.
	  The first longword is a _c_o_u_n_t of the number of static
	  refresh buffers.  The next _c_o_u_n_t longwords are the
	  addresses in refresh memory where the refresh buffers
	  lie.	The driver will cycle through these refresh
	  buffers displaying them one by one on the screen.

     PSIOAUTOMAP
	  Start automatically passing the display file through
	  the matrix processor and into the refresh buffer.  The
	  argument is an address in user memory where the follow-
	  ing data resides.  The first longword is a _c_o_u_n_t of the
	  number of display files to operate on.  The next _c_o_u_n_t
	  longwords are the address of these display files.  The
	  final longword is the address in refresh buffer memory
	  where transformed coordinates are to be placed if the
	  driver is not in double buffer mode (see below).

     PSIODOUBLEBUFFER
	  Cause the driver to double buffer the output from the
	  map that is going to the refresh buffer.  The argument
	  is again a user space address where the real arguments

	  are stored.  The first argument is the starting address
	  of refresh memory where the two double buffers are
	  located.  The second argument is the length of each
	  double buffer.  The refresh mechanism displays the
	  current double buffer, in addition to its static
	  refresh lists, when in double buffer mode.

     PSIOSINGLEREFRESH
	  Single step the refresh process. That is, the driver
	  does not continually refresh the screen.

     PSIOSINGLEMAP
	  Single step the matrix process.  The driver does not
	  automatically feed display files through the matrix
	  unit.

     PSIOSINGLEBUFFER
	  Turn off double buffering.

     PSIOTIMEREFRESH
	  The argument is a count of the number of refresh inter-
	  rupts to take before turning off the screen.	This is
	  used to do time exposures.

     PSIOWAITREFRESH
	  Suspend the user process until a refresh interrupt has
	  occurred.  If in TIMEREFRESH mode, suspend until count
	  refreshes have occurred.

     PSIOSTOPREFRESH
	  Wait for the next refresh, stop all refreshes, and then
	  return to user process.

     PSIOWAITMAP
	  Wait until a map done interrupt has occurred.

     PSIOSTOPMAP
	  Wait for a map done interrupt, do not restart the map,
	  and then return to the user.

     This shouldn't happen, check your device configuration for
     overlapping interrupt vectors.

BBUUGGSS
     An invalid access (e.g., longword) to a mapped interface
     register can cause the system to crash with a machine check.

     A user process could possibly cause infinite interrupts
     hence bringing things to a crawl.
