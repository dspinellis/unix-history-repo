     The tm-03/transport combination provides a standard tape
     drive interface as described in _m_t_i_o(4).  All drives provide
     both 800 and 1600 bpi; the TE-16 runs at 45 ips, the TU-45
     at 75 ips, while the TU-77 runs at 125 ips and autoloads
     tapes.

     ttuu%%dd:: nnoo wwrriittee rriinngg.  An attempt was made to write on the
     tape drive when no write ring was present; this message is
     written on the terminal of the user who tried to access the
     tape.

     ttuu%%dd:: nnoott oonnlliinnee.	An attempt was made to access the tape
     while it was offline; this message is written on the termi-
     nal of the user who tried to access the tape.

     to write on a tape at a different density than is already
     recorded on the tape.  This message is written on the termi-
     nal of the user who tried to switch the density.

     occurred at block _b_n; the ht error register and drive status
     register are printed in octal with the bits symbolically
     decoded.  Any error is fatal on non-raw tape; when possible
     the driver will have retried the operation which failed
     several times before reporting the error.

BBUUGGSS
     If any non-data error is encountered on non-raw tape, it
     refuses to do anything more until closed.
