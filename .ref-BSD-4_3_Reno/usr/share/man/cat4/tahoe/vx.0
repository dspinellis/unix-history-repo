     A VIOC-X provides 16 communication lines with partial modem
     control, adequate for UNIX dialup use.  Each line attached
     to the VIOC-X communications multiplexor behaves as
     described in _t_t_y(4) and may be set to run at any of 16
     speeds; see _t_t_y(4) for the encoding.

     porting the bit oriented protocol.  The number %%dd is the
     board number assigned by the system while the address %%xx is
     the address of the command control block for the vioc.

     the command queue failed because it was full.  The device is
     either overloaded or hung up for some reason.  If this hap-
     pens, the system tries to reset the device to unwedge it.

     the device in response to some command.  The command iden-
     tifier and data carrier detect mask are printed followed by
     the contents of the command buffer in error.

     to be delivered to the vioc is full.  This is probably due
     to the vioc being wedged.	The system resets the vioc if
     this occurs.
