.UC UNIX
.ul
Programmer's Manual,
Bell Laboratories, 1978 (PS2:3)\(dd
Lists commands,
system routines and interfaces, file formats,
and some of the maintenance procedures.
You can't live without this,
although you will probably only need to read section 1.

\(dd These are among the "Programmer Supplementary" Documents for 4.3BSD.
PS1 is Volume 1, PS2 is Volume 2.
.FE
An overview of the system,
for people interested in operating systems.
Worth reading by anyone who programs.
Contains a remarkable number of one-sentence observations
on how to do things right.
.LP
The Bell System Technical Journal
(BSTJ)
Special Issue on 
.UC UNIX ,
July/August, 1978,
contains many papers describing recent developments,
and some retrospective material.

B. W. Kernighan,
``A Tutorial Introduction to the
.UC UNIX
Text Editor'' (USD:12)
and
``Advanced Editing on
.UC UNIX ,''
(USD:13) Bell Laboratories, 1978.\(dg
Beginners need the introduction;
the advanced material will help you get the most
out of the editor.
.LP
M. E. Lesk,
``Typing Documents on
.UC UNIX ,''
Bell Laboratories, 1978. (USD:20)\(dg
Describes the
.UL \-ms
macro package, which isolates the novice
from the vagaries of
.UL nroff
and
.UL troff ,
and takes care of most formatting situations.
If this specific package isn't available on your system,
something similar probably is.
The most likely alternative is the
.UC PWB/UNIX
macro package
.UL \-mm ;
see your local guru if you use
.UC PWB/UNIX .*
.FS
*The macro package -me is additionally available on Berkeley Unix Systems.
-mm is typically not available.
