.SH NAME
gettytab \- terminal configuration data base
.SH SYNOPSIS
/etc/gettytab
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Gettytab
is a simplified version of the
.IR termcap (5)
data base
used to describe terminal lines.
The initial terminal login process
.IR getty (8)
accesses the
.I gettytab
file each time it starts, allowing simpler
reconfiguration of terminal characteristics.
Each entry in the data base
is used to describe one class of terminals.
.PP
There is a default terminal class,
.IR default ,
that is used to set global defaults for all other classes.
(That is, the
.I default 
entry is read, then the entry for the class required
is used to override particular settings.)
.SH CAPABILITIES
Refer to
.IR termcap (5)
for a description of the file layout.
The
.I default
column below lists defaults obtained if there is
no entry in the table obtained, nor one in the special
.I default
table.

.PP
If no line speed is specified, speed will not be altered
from that which prevails when getty is entered.
Specifying an input or output speed will override
line speed for stated direction only.
.PP
Terminal modes to be used for the output of the message,
for input of the login name,
and to leave the terminal set as upon completion,
are derived from the boolean flags specified.
If the derivation should prove inadequate,
any (or all) of these three may be overriden
with one of the
.BR f0 ,
.BR f1 ", or"
.B f2
numeric specifications, which can be used to specify
(usually in octal, with a leading '0')
the exact values of the flags.
Local (new tty) flags are set in the top 16 bits
of this (32 bit) value.
.PP
Should
.I getty
receive a null character
(presumed to indicate a line break)
it will restart using the table indicated by the
.B nx
entry. If there is none, it will re-use its original table.
.PP
Delays are specified in milliseconds, the nearest possible
delay available in the tty driver will be used.
Should greater certainty be desired, delays
with values 0, 1, 2, and 3 are interpreted as
choosing that particular delay algorithm from the driver.
.PP
The
.B cl
screen clear string may be preceded by a (decimal) number
of milliseconds of delay required (a la termcap).
This delay is simulated by repeated use of the pad character
.BR pc .
.PP
The initial message, and login message,
.B im
and
.B lm
may include the character sequence \fB%h\fP or \fB%t\fP to obtain
the hostname or tty name respectively.
(\fB%%\fP obtains a single '%' character.)
The hostname is normally obtained from the system,
but may be set by the
.B hn
table entry.
In either case it may be edited with
.BR he .
The
.B he
string is a sequence of characters, each character that
is neither '@' nor '#' is copied into the final hostname.
A '@' in the
.B he
string, causes one character from the real hostname to
be copied to the final hostname.
A '#' in the
.B he
string, causes the next character of the real hostname
to be skipped.
Surplus '@' and '#' characters are ignored.
.PP
When getty execs the login process, given
in the
.B lo
string (usually "/usr/bin/login"), it will have set
the enviroment to include the terminal type, as indicated
by the
.B tt
string (if it exists).
The
.B ev
string, can be used to enter additional data into
the environment.
It is a list of comma separated strings, each of which
will presumably be of the form
.IR name=value .
.PP
If a non-zero timeout is specified, with
.BR to ,
then getty will exit within the indicated
number of seconds, either having
received a login name and passed control
to
.IR login ,
or having received an alarm signal, and exited.
This may be useful to hangup dial in lines.
.PP
Output from
.I getty
is even parity unless
.B op
is specified.
.B Op
may be specified with
.B ap
to allow any parity on input, but generate odd parity output.
Note: this only applies while getty is being run,
terminal driver limitations prevent a more complete
implementation.
.I Getty
does not check parity of input characters in
.I RAW
mode.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
login(1),
termcap(5),
getty(8).
.SH BUGS
The special characters (erase, kill, etc.) are reset to system defaults
by
.IR login (1).
In
.B all
cases, '#' or '^H' typed in a login name will be treated as
an erase character, and '@' will be treated as a kill character.
.PP
The delay stuff is a real crock.
Apart form its general lack of flexibility, some
of the delay algorithms are not implemented.
The terminal driver should support sane delay settings.
.PP
The
.B he
capability is stupid.
.PP
.I Termcap
format is horrid, something more rational should
have been chosen.
