.SH DESCRIPTION
.B "This interface is made obsolete by sigaction(2).
.LP
The system defines a set of signals that may be delivered to a process.
Signal delivery resembles the occurence of a hardware interrupt:
the signal is blocked from further occurrence, the current process 
context is saved, and a new one is built.  A process may specify a
.I handler
to which a signal is delivered, or specify that a signal is to be 
.I blocked
or
.IR ignored .
A process may also specify that a default action is to be taken
by the system when a signal occurs.
Normally, signal handlers execute on the current stack
of the process.  This may be changed, on a per-handler basis,
so that signals are taken on a special
.IR "signal stack" .
.PP
All signals have the same
.IR priority .
Signal routines execute with the signal that caused their
invocation
.IR blocked ,
but other signals may yet occur.
A global 
.I "signal mask"
defines the set of signals currently blocked from delivery
to a process.  The signal mask for a process is initialized
from that of its parent (normally 0).  It
may be changed with a
.IR sigblock (2)
or
.IR sigsetmask (2)
call, or when a signal is delivered to the process.
.PP
When a signal
condition arises for a process, the signal is added to a set of
signals pending for the process.  If the signal is not currently
.I blocked
by the process then it is delivered to the process.  When a signal
is delivered, the current state of the process is saved,
a new signal mask is calculated (as described below), 
and the signal handler is invoked.  The call to the handler
is arranged so that if the signal handling routine returns
normally the process will resume execution in the context
from before the signal's delivery.
If the process wishes to resume in a different context, then it
must arrange to restore the previous context itself.
.PP
When a signal is delivered to a process a new signal mask is
installed for the duration of the process' signal handler
(or until a
.I sigblock
or
.I sigsetmask
call is made).
This mask is formed by taking the current signal mask,
adding the signal to be delivered, and 
.IR or 'ing
in the signal mask associated with the handler to be invoked.
.PP
.I Sigvec
assigns a handler for a specific signal.  If
.I vec
is non-zero, it
specifies a handler routine and mask
to be used when delivering the specified signal.
Further, if the SV_ONSTACK bit is set in
.I sv_flags,
the system will deliver the signal to the process on a
.IR "signal stack" ,
specified with
.IR sigstack (2).
If 
.I ovec
is non-zero, the previous handling information for the signal
is returned to the user.
.PP

with names as in the include file

.PP
The starred signals in the list above cause a core image
if not caught or ignored.
.PP
Once a signal handler is installed, it remains installed
until another
.I sigvec
call is made, or an 
.IR execve (2)
is performed.
The default action for a signal may be reinstated by setting
.I sv_handler
to SIG_DFL; this default is termination
(with a core image for starred signals)
except for signals marked with \*b or \*d.
Signals marked with \*b are discarded if the action
is SIG_DFL; signals marked
with \*d cause the process to stop.
If
.I sv_handler
is SIG_IGN the signal is subsequently ignored,
and pending instances of the signal are discarded.
.PP
If a caught signal occurs during certain system calls,
the call is normally restarted.
The call can be forced to terminate prematurely with an
EINTR error return by setting the SV_INTERRUPT bit in
.I sv_flags.
The affected system calls include
.IR read (2),
.IR write (2),
.IR sendto (2),
.IR recvfrom (2),
.IR sendmsg (2)
and
.IR recvmsg (2)
on a communications channel or a slow device (such as a terminal,
but not a regular file)
and during a
.IR wait (2)
or
.IR ioctl (2).
However, calls that have already committed are not restarted,
but instead return a partial success (for example, a short read count).
.PP
After a
.IR fork (2)
or
.IR vfork (2)
the child inherits
all signals, the signal mask, the signal stack,
and the restart/interrupt flags.
.PP
.IR  Execve (2)
resets all
caught signals to default action and
resets all signals to be caught on the user stack.
Ignored signals remain ignored;
the signal mask remains the same;
signals that interrupt system calls continue to do so.
.SH NOTES
The mask specified in 
.I vec
is not allowed to block SIGKILL or SIGSTOP.
This is done silently by the system.
.PP
The SV_INTERRUPT flag is not available in 4.2BSD,
hence it should not be used if backward compatibility is needed.
.SH "RETURN VALUE
A 0 value indicated that the call succeeded.  A \-1 return value
indicates an error occurred and
.I errno
is set to indicated the reason.
.SH ERRORS
.I Sigvec
will fail and no new signal handler will be installed if one
of the following occurs:
.TP 15
[EFAULT]
Either
.I vec
or 
.I ovec
points to memory that is not a valid part of the process
address space.
.TP 15
[EINVAL]
.I Sig
is not a valid signal number.
.TP 15
[EINVAL]
An attempt is made to ignore or supply a handler for SIGKILL
or SIGSTOP.

.SH "NOTES  (VAX-11)"
The handler routine can be declared:
.PP
    void handler(sig, code, scp)
    int sig, code;
    struct sigcontext *scp;
.PP
Here
.I sig
is the signal number, into which the hardware faults and traps are
mapped as defined below. 
.I Code
is a parameter that is either a constant
as given below or, for compatibility mode faults, the code provided by
the hardware (Compatibility mode faults are distinguished from the
other SIGILL traps by having PSL_CM set in the psl).
.I Scp
is a pointer to the
.I sigcontext
structure (defined in
.RI < signal.h >),
used to restore the context from before the signal.
.PP
The following defines the mapping of hardware traps to signals
and codes.  All of these symbols are defined in
.RI < signal.h >:
