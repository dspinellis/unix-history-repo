.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Strcasecmp
and
.B strncasecmp
compare the null-terminated strings
.I s1
and
.I s2
and return an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0,
according as
.I s1
is lexicographically greater than, equal to, or less than
.IR s2
after translation of each corresponding character to lower-case.
The strings themselves are not modified.
The comparison is done using unsigned characters, so that '\e200'
is greater than '\e0'.
.PP
.B Strncasecmp
compares at most
.I len
characters.
