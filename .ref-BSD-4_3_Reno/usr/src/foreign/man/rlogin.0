     RRllooggiinn starts a terminal session on a remote host _h_o_s_t.

     RRllooggiinn first attempts to use the Kerberos authorization mechanism,
     described below.  If the remote host does not supporting Kerberos the
     standard Berkeley _r_h_o_s_t_s authorization mechanism is used.	The options
     are as follows:

     --88        The --88 option allows an eight-bit input data path at all times;
	       otherwise parity bits are stripped except when the remote
	       side's stop and start characters are other than ^S/^Q.

     --EE        The --EE option stops any character from being recognized as an
	       escape character.  When used with the --88 option, this provides
	       a completely transparent connection.

     --KK        The --KK option turns off all Kerberos authentication.

     --LL        The --LL option allows the rlogin session to be run in ``litout''
	       (see tty(4)) mode.

     --dd        The --dd option turns on socket debugging (see setsockopt(2)) on
	       the TCP sockets used for communication with the remote host.

     --ee        The --ee option allows user specification of the escape charac-
	       ter, which is ``~'' by default.	This specification may be as a
	       literal character, or as an octal value in the form \nnn.

     --kk        The option requests rlogin to obtain tickets for the remote
	       host in realm _r_e_a_l_m instead of the remote host's realm as
	       determined by krb_realmofhost(3).

     A line of the form ``<escape char>.'' disconnects from the remote host.
     Similarly, the line ``<escape char>^Z'' will suspend the rrllooggiinn session,
     and ``<escape char><delayed-suspend char>'' suspends the send portion of
     the rlogin, but allows output from the remote system.  By default, the
     tilde (``~'') character is the escape character, and normally control-Y
     (``^Y'') is the delayed-suspend character.

     All echoing takes place at the remote site, so that (except for delays)
     the rrllooggiinn is transparent.  Flow control via ^S/^Q and flushing of input
     and output on interrupts are handled properly.

     Each user may have a private authorization list in the file ._k_l_o_g_i_n in
     their home directory.  Each line in this file should contain a Kerberos
     principal name of the form _p_r_i_n_c_i_p_a_l._i_n_s_t_a_n_c_e@_r_e_a_l_m.  If the originating
     user is authenticated to one of the principals named in ._k_l_o_g_i_n, access
     is granted to the account.  The principal _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_n_a_m_e.@_l_o_c_a_l_r_e_a_l_m is
     granted access if there is no ._k_l_o_g_i_n file.  Otherwise a login and pass-
     word will be prompted for on the remote machine as in login(1).  To avoid
     certain security problems, the ._k_l_o_g_i_n file must be owned by the remote
     user.

     If Kerberos authentication fails, a warning message is printed and the
     standard Berkeley _r_l_o_g_i_n is used instead.

     RRllooggiinn appeared in 4.2 BSD.

     RRllooggiinn will be replaced by telnet(1) in the near future.

     More of the environment should be propagated.
