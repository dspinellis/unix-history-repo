.Sh NAME
.Nm mtree
.Nd map a directory hierarchy
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mtree
.Op Fl cderux
.Op Fl f Ar spec
.Op Fl p Ar path
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Mtree
compares a directory hierarchy against a specification for a
directory hierarchy.
By default, the specification is read from the standard input.
.Nm Mtree
verifies that the tree rooted in the current directory matches the
specification.
.Pp
Messages are written to standard output for any files whose
characteristics do not match those of the specification, or which are
missing from either the specification or the tree.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Tp Fl c
Print a specification for the tree to standard output.
.Tp Fl d
Ignore everything except directory type files.
.Tp Fl e
Don't object to files that are in the tree but not in the specification.
.Tp Fl f
Read the specification from
.Ar file  ,
instead of from standard input.
.Tp Fl p
Traverse the tree rooted in
.Ar path  ,
instead of the current directory.
.Tp Fl r
Remove any files in the tree that are not described in the
specification.
.Tp Fl u
Modify the owner, group, and permissions of existing files to match
the specification, as well as create any missing directories.
Owner, group, and permissions must all be specified for missing
directories to be created.
.Tp Fl x
Don't descend below any mount points.
.Tp
.Pp
Specifications are mostly composed of ``keywords'', i.e. strings that
that specify values relating to files.
No keywords have default values, and if a keyword has no set value no
checks based on it are performed.
.Pp
Currently supported keywords are as follows:
.Tw Cm
.Tp Cm cksum
The checksum of the file using the algorithm specified by
the program
.Xr cksum  1  .
.Tp Cm ignore
Causes the hierarchy below the file to be ignored.
.Tp Cm group
The group of the file; may be either numeric or symbolic.
.Tp Cm mode
The current file's permissions as an absolute (octal) or symbolic
value (see
.Xr chmod  1  ) .
.Tp Cm nlink
The number of hard links the file is expected to have.
.Tp Cm owner
The owner of the file; may be either numeric or symbolic.
.Tp Cm size
The size, in bytes, of the file.
.Tp Cm link
The file a symbolic link is expected to reference.
.Tp Cm time
The last modification time of the file.
.Tp Cm type
The type of the file; may be set to any one of the following:
.Tw Cm
.Tp Cm block
block special device
.Tp Cm char
character special device
.Tp Cm dir
directory
.Tp Cm fifo
fifo
.Tp Cm file
regular file
.Tp Cm link
symbolic link
.Tp Cm socket
socket
.Tp
.Tp
.Pp
There are four types of lines in a specification.
.Pp
The first type of line sets a ``global'' value for a keyword, and
consists of a leading ``/set'' followed by whitespace, followed by
sets of keyword/value pairs, separated by whitespace.
Keyword/value pairs consist of a keyword, followed by a equals sign
(``=''), followed by a value, without intervening whitespace.
Once a keyword has been set, its value remains unchanged until either
set again or unset.
.Pp
The second type of line unsets keywords and consists of a leading
``/unset'', followed by whitespace, followed by one or more keywords,
separated by whitespace.
.Pp
The third type of line is a file specification and consists of a file
name, followed by whitespace, followed by zero or more whitespace
separated keyword/value pairs.
The file name may be preceded by any number of whitespace characters.
The file name may contain any of the standard file name matching
characters (``['', ``]'', ``?'' or ``*''), in which case files
in the hierarchy will be associated with the first pattern that
they match.
.Pp
Each of the keyword/value pairs consist of a keyword, followed by an
equals sign (``=''), followed by the keyword's value, without intervening
whitespace.
These values override, without changing, the global value of the
corresponding keyword.
.Pp
All paths are relative.
Specifying a directory will cause subsequent files to be searched
for in that directory hierarchy.
Which brings us to the last type of line in a specification: a line
containing only the string
.Dq Nm \&..
causes the current directory
path to ascend one level.
.Pp
Empty lines and lines whose first non-whitespace character is a hash
mark (``#'') are ignored.
.Pp
.Nm Mtree
exits with a status of 0 on success and >0 if an error occurred or the
tree did not match the specification.

.Sh BUGS
The
.Cm cksum
keyword is not yet implemented.
.Pp
The
.Cm time
keyword should be specifiable in human readable terms.
