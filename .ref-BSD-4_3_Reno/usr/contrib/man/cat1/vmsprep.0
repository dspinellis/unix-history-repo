     _V_m_s_p_r_e_p traverses hierarchies of files and prepares them for
     transportation to VMS.  Since ANSI stardard tapes (the VMS
     standard) do not allow hierarchy, this program provides a
     method of flattening the hierarchy onto a tape in such a way
     that it can be unpacked on VMS to recreate the same tree
     structure.

     For reasons best not described here, _v_m_s_p_r_e_p will attempt to
     exclude all RCS and SCCS archives by ignoring all files or
     directories named 'RCS' or 'SCCS', or files starting with
     's.' or ending in ',v'.

     The output of _v_m_s_p_r_e_p is a pair of files vmsprep.namelist
     and UNPACK.COM.  vmsprep.namelist is a list of files to be
     placed on the tape in the format required by _a_n_s_i_t_a_p_e. If
     the first argument is '-' instead of a file or directory
     name, vmsprep will instead send the namelist to standard
     output, and place UNPACK.COM in /tmp to avoid attempting to
     write in the current directory.  All of the files except
     UNPACK.COM will be placed on the tape under cryptic names.
     UNPACK.COM is a VMS command script which will recreate all
     of the necessary directories and then move the cryptically
     named files to their proper place.

     A typical sequence would be:
	  vmsprep - tree1 tree2 file | ansitape cln trees -
     _T_h_e_n _o_n _a _V_M_S _m_a_c_h_i_n_e
	  mount MFA0: trees
	  copy MFA0:*.*.* *
	  @UNPACK

     A warning is reported if a file or directory name contains a
     character not permitted in VMS names. The offending charac-
     ter is replaced by 'Z' and _v_m_s_p_r_e_p continues.

     Extra periods in file names may not be dealt with optimally.

     All files and directories to be moved must be descendants of
     the current working directory.  Absolute path names and
     paths containing ".." will produce unpredictable results.
     Since vmsprep uses find(1) internally, it does not follow
     symbolic links.
     The exclusion of RCS and SCCS files should be controlled by
     a command line flag.
     Assumes VMS v4.0 or greater for long file names.
