 a command (a Lisp function suitable for interactive calling)
 a string (treated as a keyboard macro),
 a keymap (to define a prefix key),
 a list (KEYMAP . CHAR), meaning use definition of CHAR in map KEYMAP,
 or a symbol.  The symbol's function definition is used as the key's
definition, and may be any of the above (including another symbol).Flookup-key
In keymap KEYMAP, look up key sequence KEYS.  Return the definition.

Select buffer BUFFER in the current window.
BUFFER may be a buffer or a buffer name.
Optional second arg NORECORD non-nil means
do not put this buffer at the front of the list of recently selected ones.

WARNING: This is NOT the way to work on another buffer temporarily
within a Lisp program!  Use `set-buffer' instead.  That avoids messing with
the window-buffer correspondances.Fpop-to-buffer
Select buffer BUFFER in some window, preferably a different one.
If  pop-up-windows  is non-nil, windows can be split to do this.
If second arg  OTHER-WINDOW is non-nil, insist on finding another
window even if BUFFER is already visible in the selected window.Fcurrent-buffer
Return the current buffer as a Lisp buffer object.Fset-buffer
Set the current buffer to the buffer or buffer name supplied as argument.
That buffer will then be the default for editing operations and printing.
This function's effect can't last past end of current command
because returning to command level
selects the chosen buffer of the current window,
and this function has no effect on what buffer that is.
See also `save-excursion' when you want to select a buffer temporarily.
Use `switch-to-buffer' or `pop-to-buffer' for interactive buffer selection.Fbarf-if-buffer-read-only
Signal a  buffer-read-only  error if the current buffer is read-only.Fbury-buffer
Put BUFFER at the end of the list of all buffers.
There it is the least likely candidate for other-buffer to return;
thus, the least likely buffer for \[switch-to-buffer] to select by default.Ferase-buffer

Display a list of names of existing buffers.
Inserts it in buffer *Buffer List* and displays that.

This is the same as (default-value 'case-fold-search).Vmode-line-format
Template for displaying mode line for current buffer.
Each buffer has its own value of this variable.
Value may be a string, a symbol or a list or cons cell.
For a symbol, its value is used (but it is ignored if t or nil).
 A string appearing directly as the value of a symbol is processed verbatim
 in that the %-constructs below are not recognized.
For a list whose car is a symbol, the symbol's value is taken,
 and if that is non-nil, the cadr of the list is processed recursively.
 Otherwise, the caddr of the list (if there is one) is processed.
For a list whose car is a string or list, each element is processed
 recursively and the results are effectively concatenated.
For a list whose car is an integer, the cdr of the list is processed
  and padded (if the number is positive) or truncated (if negative)
  to the width specified by that number.
A string is printed verbatim in the mode line except for %-constructs:
  (%-constructs are allowed when the string is the entire mode-line-format
   or when it is found in a cons-cell or a list)
  %b -- print buffer name.      %f -- print visited file name.
  %* -- print *, % or hyphen.   %m -- print value of mode-name (obsolete).
  %s -- print process status.   %M -- print value of global-mode-string. (obs)
  %p -- print percent of buffer above top of window, or top, bot or all.
  %n -- print Narrow if appropriate.
  %[ -- print one [ for each recursive editing level.  %] similar.
  %% -- print %.   %- -- print infinitely many dashes.
Decimal digits after the % specify field width to which to pad.Vdefault-major-mode

PROMPT is a string to prompt with; normally it ends in a colon and a space.
TABLE is an alist whose elements' cars are strings, or an obarray (see try-completion).
PREDICATE limits completion to a subset of TABLE; see try-completion for details.
If REQUIRE-MATCH is non-nil, the user is not allowed to exit unless
 the input is (or completes to) an element of TABLE.

A $ begins a request to substitute; the env variable name is the alphanumeric
characters and underscores after the $, or is surrounded by braces.

representations of the character between the start of the previous line
and point.  (eg control characters will have a width of 2 or 4, tabs
will have a variable width)
Ignores finite width of screen, which means that this function may return
values greater than (screen-width).
Whether the line is visible (if `selective-display' is t) has no effect.Findent-to

matched by parenthesis constructs in the pattern.Fskip-chars-forward
Move point forward, stopping before a char not in CHARS, or at position LIM.
CHARS is like the inside of a [...] in a regular expression

Return the car of CONSCELL.  If arg is nil, return nil.Fcar-safe
Return the car of OBJECT if it is a cons cell, or else  nil.Fcdr
Return the cdr of CONSCELL.  If arg is nil, return nil.Fcdr-safe

Set SYMBOL's default value to VAL.  SYMBOL and VAL are evaluated.
The default value is seen in buffers that do not have their own values
for this variable.Fsetq-default
Set SYMBOL's default value to VAL.  VAL is evaluated; SYMBOL is not.
The default value is seen in buffers that do not have their own values
for this variable.Fmake-variable-buffer-local
Make VARIABLE have a separate value for each buffer.
At any time, the value for the current buffer is in effect.
There is also a default value which is seen in any buffer which has not yet
set its own value.
The function `default-value' gets the default value and `set-default' sets it.
Using `set' or `setq' to set the variable causes it to have a separate value
for the current buffer if it was previously using the default value.Fmake-local-variable
Make VARIABLE have a separate value in the current buffer.
Other buffers will continue to share a common default value.
See also `make-variable-buffer-local'.Fkill-local-variable
Make VARIABLE no longer have a separate value in the current buffer.
From now on the default value will apply in this buffer.Faref
Return the element of ARRAY at index INDEX.
ARRAY may be a vector or a string.  INDEX starts at 0.Faset

T if NUMBER is zero.Fint-to-string
Convert INT to a string by printing it in decimal, with minus sign if negative.Fstring-to-int
Convert STRING to an integer by parsing it as a decimal number.
Optional second arg FLAG non-nil means also convert "yes" to 1, "no" to 0.F+

Negate number or subtract numbers.
With one arg, negates it.  With more than one arg,
subtracts all but the first from the first.F*

Returns first argument divided by rest of arguments.F%
Returns remainder of first arg divided by second.Fmax
Return largest of all the arguments (which must be numbers.)Fmin
Return smallest of all the arguments (which must be numbers.)Flogand
Return bitwise and of all the arguments (numbers).Flogior
Return bitwise or of all the arguments (numbers).Flogxor
Return bitwise exclusive-or of all the arguments (numbers).Fash
Return VALUE with its bits shifted left by COUNT.
If COUNT is negative, shifting is actually to the right.
In this case, the sign bit is duplicated.Flsh
Return VALUE with its bits shifted left by COUNT.
If COUNT is negative, shifting is actually to the right.
In this case,  zeros are shifted in on the left.F1+
Return NUMBER plus one.F1-
Return NUMBER minus one.Flognot
Return the bitwise complement of ARG.Fdocumentation
Return the documentation string of FUNCTION.Fdocumentation-property
Return the documentation string that is SYMBOL's PROP property.
This differs from using `get' only in that it can refer to strings
stored in the etc/DOC file.FSnarf-documentation
Used during Emacs initialization, before dumping runnable Emacs,
to find pointers to doc strings stored in etc/DOC... and
record them in function definitions.
One arg, FILENAME, a string which does not include a directory.
The file is found in ../etc now; found in the exec-directory
when doc strings are referred to later in the dumped Emacs.Fsubstitute-command-keys
Return the STRING with substrings of the form \=\[COMMAND]
replaced by either:  a keystroke sequence that will invoke COMMAND,
or "M-x COMMAND" if COMMAND is not on any keys.
Substrings of the form \=\{MAPVAR} are replaced by summaries
(made by describe-bindings) of the value of MAPVAR, taken as a keymap.
Substrings of the form \=\<MAPVAR> specify to use the value of MAPVAR
as the keymap for future \=\[COMMAND] substrings.
\=\= quotes the following character and is discarded;
thus, \=\=\=\= puts \=\= into the output, and \=\=\=\[ puts \=\[ into the output.Fchar-to-string
Convert arg CHAR to a string containing that character.Fstring-to-char
Convert arg STRING to a character, the first character of that string.Fpoint
Return value of point, as an integer.
Beginning of buffer is position (point-min)Fpoint-marker
Return value of point, as a marker object.Fgoto-char
One arg, a number.  Set point to that number.
Beginning of buffer is position (point-min), end is (point-max).Fregion-beginning
Return position of beginning of region, as an integer.Fregion-end
Return position of end of region, as an integer.Fmark
Return this buffer's mark value as integer, or nil if no mark.
If you are using this in an editing command, you are most likely making
a mistake; see the documentation of `set-mark'.Fmark-marker
Return this buffer's mark, as a marker object.
Watch out!  Moving this marker changes the mark position.
The marker will not point anywhere if mark is not set.Fset-mark
Set this buffer's mark to POS.  Don't use this function!
That is to say, don't use this function unless you want
the user to see that the mark has moved, and you want the previous
mark position to be lost.

Normally, when a new mark is set, the old one should go on the stack.
This is why most applications should use push-mark, not set-mark.

Novice programmers often try to use the mark for the wrong purposes.
The mark saves a location for the user's convenience.
Most editing commands should not alter the mark.
To remember a location for internal use in the Lisp program,
store it in a Lisp variable.  Example:

   (let ((beg (point))) (forward-line 1) (delete-region beg (point))).Fsave-excursion
Save point (and mark), execute BODY, then restore point and mark.
Executes BODY just like PROGN.  Point and mark values are restored
even in case of abnormal exit (throw or error).Fbuffer-size
Return the number of characters in the current buffer.Fpoint-min
Return the minimum permissible value of point in the current buffer.
This is 1, unless a clipping restriction is in effect.Fpoint-min-marker
Return a marker to the beginning of the currently visible part of the buffer.
This is the beginning, unless a clipping restriction is in effect.Fpoint-max
Return the maximum permissible value of point in the current buffer.
This is (1+ (buffer-size)), unless a clipping restriction is in effect,
in which case it is less.Fpoint-max-marker
Return a marker to the end of the currently visible part of the buffer.
This is the actual end, unless a clipping restriction is in effect.Ffollowing-char
Return the character following point, as a number.Fpreceding-char
Return the character preceding point, as a number.Fbobp
Return T if point is at the beginning of the buffer.
If the buffer is narrowed, this means the beginning of the narrowed part.Feobp
Return T if point is at the end of the buffer.
If the buffer is narrowed, this means the end of the narrowed part.Fbolp
Return T if point is at the beginning of a line.Feolp
Return T if point is at the end of a line.
`End of a line' includes point being at the end of the buffer.Fchar-after
One arg, POS, a number.  Return the character in the current buffer
at position POS.
If POS is out of range, the value is NIL.Fuser-login-name
Return the name under which user logged in, as a string.
This is based on the effective uid, not the real uid.Fuser-real-login-name
Return the name of the user's real uid, as a string.
Differs from user-login-name when running under su.Fuser-uid
Return the effective uid of Emacs, as an integer.Fuser-real-uid
Return the real uid of Emacs, as an integer.Fuser-full-name
Return the full name of the user logged in, as a string.Fsystem-name
Return the name of the machine you are running on, as a string.Fcurrent-time-string
Return the current time, as a human-readable string.Finsert
Any number of args, strings or chars.  Insert them after point, moving point forward.Finsert-before-markers
Any number of args, strings or chars.  Insert them after point,
moving point forward.  Also, any markers pointing at the insertion point
get relocated to point after the newly inserted text.Finsert-char
Insert COUNT (second arg) copies of CHAR (first arg).
Both arguments are required.Fbuffer-substring
Return the contents of part of the current buffer as a string.
The two arguments specify the start and end, as character numbers.Fbuffer-string
Return the contents of the current buffer as a string.Finsert-buffer-substring
Insert before point a substring of the contents buffer BUFFER.
BUFFER may be a buffer or a buffer name.
Arguments START and END are character numbers specifying the substring.
They default to the beginning and the end of BUFFER.Fsubst-char-in-region
From START to END, replace FROMCHAR with TOCHAR each time it occurs.
If optional arg NOUNDO is non-nil, don't record this change for undo
and don't mark the buffer as really changed.Fdelete-region
Delete the text between point and mark.
When called from a program, expects two arguments,
character numbers specifying the stretch to be deleted.Fwiden
Remove restrictions from current buffer, allowing full text to be seen and edited.Fnarrow-to-region
Restrict editing in this buffer to the current region.
The rest of the text becomes temporarily invisible and untouchable
but is not deleted; if you save the buffer in a file, the invisible
text is included in the file.  \[widen] makes all visible again.

When calling from a program, pass two arguments; character numbers
bounding the text that should remain visible.Fsave-restriction
Execute the body, undoing at the end any changes to current buffer's restrictions.
Changes to restrictions are made by narrow-to-region or by widen.
Thus, the restrictions are the same after this function as they were before it.
The value returned is that returned by the last form in the body.

This function can be confused if, within the body, you widen
and then make changes outside the area within the saved restrictions.

Note: if you are using both save-excursion and save-restriction,
use save-excursion outermost.Fmessage
Print a one-line message at the bottom of the screen.
The first argument is a control string.
It may contain %s or %d or %c to print successive following arguments.
%s means print an argument as a string, %d means print as number in decimal,
%c means print a number as a single character.
The argument used by %s must be a string or a symbol;
the argument used by %d or %c must be a number.Fformat
Format a string out of a control-string and arguments.
The first argument is a control string.
It, and subsequent arguments substituted into it, become the value, which is a string.
It may contain %s or %d or %c to substitute successive following arguments.
%s means print an argument as a string, %d means print as number in decimal,
%c means print a number as a single character.
The argument used by %s must be a string or a symbol;
the argument used by %d, %b, %o, %x or %c must be a number.Fchar-equal
T if args (both characters (numbers)) match.  May ignore case.
Case is ignored if the current buffer specifies to do so.Fgetenv
One arg VAR, a string.  Return the value of environment variable VAR, as a string.Finteractive
Specify a way of parsing arguments for interactive use of a function.
For example, write
  (defun fun (arg) "Doc string" (interactive "p") ...use arg...)
to make arg be the prefix numeric argument when foo is called as a command.
This is actually a declaration rather than a function;
 it tells  call-interactively  how to read arguments
 to pass to the function.
When actually called,  interactive  just returns nil.

The argument of  interactive  is usually a string containing a code letter
 followed by a prompt.  (Some code letters do not use I/O to get
 the argument and do not need prompts.)  To prompt for multiple arguments,
 give a code letter, its prompt, a newline, and another code letter, etc.
If the argument is not a string, it is evaluated to get a list of
 arguments to pass to the function.
Just  (interactive)  means pass no args when calling interactively.

Code letters available are:
a -- Function name: symbol with a function definition.
b -- Name of existing buffer.
B -- Name of buffer, possibly nonexistent.
c -- Character.
C -- Command name: symbol with interactive function definition.
d -- Value of point as number.  Does not do I/O.
D -- Directory name.
f -- Existing file name.
F -- Possibly nonexistent file name.
k -- Key sequence (string).
m -- Value of mark as number.  Does not do I/O.
n -- Number read using minibuffer.
N -- Prefix arg converted to number, or if none, do like code `n'.
p -- Prefix arg converted to number.  Does not do I/O.
P -- Prefix arg in raw form.  Does not do I/O.
r -- Region: point and mark as 2 numeric args, smallest first.  Does no I/O.
s -- Any string.
S -- Any symbol.
v -- Variable name: symbol that is user-variable-p.
x -- Lisp expression read but not evaluated.
X -- Lisp expression read and evaluated.
In addition, if the first character of the string is '*' then an error is
 signaled if the buffer is read-only.
 This happens before reading any arguments.Fcall-interactively
Call FUNCTION, reading args according to its interactive calling specs.
The function contains a specification of how to do the argument reading.
In the case of user-defined functions, this is specified by placing a call
to the function `interactive' at the top level of the function body.
See `interactive'.

Optional second arg RECORD-FLAG non-nil
means unconditionally put this command in the command-history.
Otherwise, this is done only if an arg is read using the minibuffer.Fprefix-numeric-value
Return numeric meaning of raw prefix argument ARG.
A raw prefix argument is what you get from (interactive "P").Vprefix-arg
The value of the prefix argument for the next editing command.
It may be a number, or the symbol - for just a minus sign as arg,
or a list whose car is a number for just one or more C-U's
or nil if no argument has been specified.

You cannot examine this variable to find the argument for this command
since it has been set to nil by the time you can look.
Instead, you should use the variable current-prefix-arg, although
normally commands can get this prefix argument with (interactive "P").Vcurrent-prefix-arg
The value of the prefix argument for this editing command.
It may be a number, or the symbol - for just a minus sign as arg,
or a list whose car is a number for just one or more C-U's
or nil if no argument has been specified.
This is what (interactive "P") returns.Vcommand-history
List of recent commands that read arguments from terminal.
Each command is represented as a form to evaluate.For
Eval args until one of them yields non-NIL, then return that value.
The remaining args are not evalled at all.
If all args return NIL, return NIL.Fand
Eval args until one of them yields NIL, then return NIL.
The remaining args are not evalled at all.
If no arg yields NIL, return the last arg's value.Fif
(if C T E...) if C yields non-NIL do T, else do E...
Returns the value of T or the value of the last of the E's.
There may be no E's; then if C yields NIL, the value is NIL.Fcond
(cond CLAUSES...) tries each clause until one succeeds.
Each clause looks like (C BODY...).  C is evaluated
and, if the value is non-nil, this clause succeeds:
then the expressions in BODY are evaluated and the last one's
value is the value of the cond expression.
If a clause looks like (C), C's value if non-nil is returned from cond.
If no clause succeeds, cond returns nil.Fprogn
Eval arguments in sequence, and return the value of the last one.Fprog1
Eval arguments in sequence, then return the FIRST arg's value.
This value is saved during the evaluation of the remaining args,
whose values are discarded.Fprog2
Eval arguments in sequence, then return the SECOND arg's value.
This value is saved during the evaluation of the remaining args,
whose values are discarded.Fsetq
(setq SYM VAL SYM VAL ...) sets each SYM to the value of its VAL.
The SYMs are not evaluated.  Thus (setq x y) sets x to the value of y.
Each SYM is set before the next VAL is computed.Fquote
Return the argument, without evaluating it.  (quote x)  yields  x.Ffunction
Quote a function object.
Equivalent to the quote function in the interpreter,
but causes the compiler to compile the argument as a function
if it is not a symbol.Finteractive-p
Return t if function in which this appears was called interactively.
This means that the function was called with call-interactively (which
includes being called as the binding of a key)
and input is currently coming from the keyboard (not in keyboard macro).Fdefun
(defun NAME ARGLIST [DOCSTRING] BODY...) defines NAME as a function.
The definition is (lambda ARGLIST [DOCSTRING] BODY...).
See also the function  interactive .Fdefmacro
(defmacro NAME ARGLIST [DOCSTRING] BODY...) defines NAME as a macro.
The definition is (macro lambda ARGLIST [DOCSTRING] BODY...).
When the macro is called, as in (NAME ARGS...),
the function (lambda ARGLIST BODY...) is applied to
the list ARGS... as it appears in the expression,
and the result should be a form to be evaluated instead of the original.Fdefvar
(defvar SYMBOL INITVALUE DOCSTRING) defines SYMBOL as an advertised variable.
INITVALUE is evaluated, and used to set SYMBOL, only if SYMBOL's value is void.
INITVALUE and DOCSTRING are optional.
If DOCSTRING starts with *, this variable is identified as a user option.
 This means that M-x set-variable and M-x edit-options recognize it.
If INITVALUE is missing, SYMBOL's value is not set.Fdefconst
(defconst SYMBOL INITVALUE DOCSTRING) defines SYMBOL as a constant variable.
The intent is that programs do not change this value (but users may).
Always sets the value of SYMBOL to the result of evalling INITVALUE.
DOCSTRING is optional.
If DOCSTRING starts with *, this variable is identified as a user option.
 This means that M-x set-variable and M-x edit-options recognize it.Fuser-variable-p
Returns t if VARIABLE is intended to be set and modified by users,
as opposed to by programs.
Determined by whether the first character of the documentation
for the variable is "*"Flet*
(let* VARLIST BODY...) binds variables according to VARLIST then executes BODY.
The value of the last form in BODY is returned.
Each element of VARLIST is a symbol (which is bound to NIL)
or a list (SYMBOL VALUEFORM) (which binds SYMBOL to the value of VALUEFORM).
Each VALUEFORM can refer to the symbols already bound by this VARLIST.Flet
(let VARLIST BODY...) binds variables according to VARLIST then executes BODY.
The value of the last form in BODY is returned.
Each element of VARLIST is a symbol (which is bound to NIL)
or a list (SYMBOL VALUEFORM) (which binds SYMBOL to the value of VALUEFORM).
All the VALUEFORMs are evalled before any symbols are bound.Fwhile
(while TEST BODY...) if TEST yields non-NIL, execute the BODY forms and repeat.Fmacroexpand
If FORM is a macro call, expand it.
If the result of expansion is another macro call, expand it, etc.
Return the ultimate expansion.
The second optional arg ENVIRONMENT species an environment of macro
definitions to shadow the loaded ones for use in file byte-compilation.Fcatch
(catch TAG BODY...) perform BODY allowing nonlocal exits using (throw TAG).
TAG is evalled to get the tag to use.  throw  to that tag exits this catch.
Then the BODY is executed.  If no  throw  happens, the value of the last BODY
form is returned from  catch.  If a  throw  happens, it specifies the value to
return from  catch.Fthrow
(throw TAG VALUE): throw to the catch for TAG and return VALUE from it.
Both TAG and VALUE are evalled.Funwind-protect
Do BODYFORM, protecting with UNWINDFORMS.
Usage looks like (unwind-protect BODYFORM UNWINDFORMS...) 
If BODYFORM completes normally, its value is returned
after executing the UNWINDFORMS.
If BODYFORM exits nonlocally, the UNWINDFORMS are executed anyway.Fcondition-case
Regain control when an error is signaled.
 (condition-case VAR BODYFORM HANDLERS...)
executes BODYFORM and returns its value if no error happens.
Each element of HANDLERS looks like (CONDITION-NAME BODY...)
where the BODY is made of Lisp expressions.
The handler is applicable to an error
if CONDITION-NAME is one of the error's condition names.
When a handler handles an error,
control returns to the condition-case and the handler BODY... is executed
with VAR bound to (SIGNALED-CONDITIONS . SIGNAL-DATA).
The value of the last BODY form is returned from the condition-case.
See SIGNAL for more info.Fsignal
Signal an error.  Args are SIGNAL-NAME, and associated DATA.
A signal name is a symbol with an  error-conditions  property
that is a list of condition names.
A handler for any of those names will get to handle this signal.
The symbol  error  should always be one of them.

DATA should be a list.  Its elements are printed as part of the error message.
If the signal is handled, DATA is made available to the handler.
See  condition-case.Fcommandp
T if FUNCTION makes provisions for interactive calling.
This means it contains a description for how to read arguments to give it.
The value is nil for an invalid function or a symbol with no function definition.

Interactively callable functions include strings (treated as keyboard macros),
lambda-expressions that contain a top-level call to  interactive ,
autoload definitions made by  autoload  with non-nil fourth argument,
and some of the built-in functions of Lisp.

Also, a symbol is commandp if its function definition is commandp.Fautoload
Define FUNCTION to autoload from FILE.
FUNCTION is a symbol; FILE is a file name string to pass to  load.
Third arg DOCSTRING is documentation for the function.
Fourth arg INTERACTIVE if non-nil says function can be called interactively.
Fifth arg MACRO if non-nil says the function is really a macro.
Third through fifth args give info about the real definition.
They default to nil.
If FUNCTION is already defined other than as an autoload,
this does nothing and returns nil.Feval
Evaluate FORM and return its value.Fapply
Call FUNCTION, passing remaining arguments to it.  The last argument
is a list of arguments to pass.
Thus, (apply '+ 1 2 '(3 4)) returns 10.Ffuncall
Call first argument as a function, passing remaining arguments to it.
Thus,  (funcall 'cons 'x 'y)  returns  (x . y).Fbacktrace-debug
Set the debug-on-exit flag of eval frame LEVEL levels down to FLAG.
The debugger is entered when that frame exits, if the flag is non-nil.Fbacktrace
Print a trace of Lisp function calls currently active.
Output stream used is value of standard-output.Vmax-specpdl-size
Limit on number of Lisp variable bindings & unwind-protects before error.Vmax-lisp-eval-depth
Limit on depth in eval, apply and funcall before error.Vquit-flag
Non-nil causes  eval  to abort, unless  inhibit-quit  is non-nil.
Typing C-G sets  quit-flag  non-nil, regardless of  inhibit-quit.Vinhibit-quit
Non-nil inhibits C-g quitting from happening immediately.
Note that  quit-flag  will still be set by typing C-g,
so a quit will be signalled as soon as  inhibit-quit  is nil.
To prevent this happening, set  quit-flag  to nil
before making  inhibit-quit  nil.Vstack-trace-on-error
*Non-nil means automatically display a backtrace buffer
after any error that is handled by the editor command loop.Vdebug-on-error
*Non-nil means enter debugger if an error is signaled.
Does not apply to errors handled by condition-case.
See also variable debug-on-quit.Vdebug-on-quit
*Non-nil means enter debugger if quit is signaled (C-G, for example).
Does not apply if quit is handled by a condition-case.Vdebug-on-next-call
Non-nil means enter debugger before next eval, apply or funcall.Vdebugger
Function to call to invoke debugger.
If due to frame exit, args are 'exit and value being returned;
 this function's value will be returned instead of that.
If due to error, args are 'error and list of signal's args.
If due to apply or funcall entry, one arg, 'lambda.
If due to eval entry, one arg, 't.Vmocklisp-arguments
While in a mocklisp function, the list of its unevaluated args.Fidentity
Return the argument unchanged.Frandom
Return a pseudo-random number.
On most systems all integers representable in Lisp are equally likely.
  This is 24 bits' worth.
On some systems, absolute value of result never exceeds 2 to the 14.
If optional argument is supplied as  t,
 the random number seed is set based on the current time and pid.Flength
Return the length of vector, list or string SEQUENCE.Fstring-equal
T if two strings have identical contents.
Symbols are also allowed; their print names are used instead.Fstring-lessp
T if first arg string is less than second in lexicographic order.
Symbols are also allowed; their print names are used instead.Fappend
Concatenate arguments and make the result a list.
The result is a list whose elements are the elements of all the arguments.
Each argument may be a list, vector or string.Fconcat
Concatenate arguments and make the result a string.
The result is a string whose elements are the elements of all the arguments.
Each argument may be a string, a list of numbers, or a vector of numbers.Fvconcat
Concatenate arguments and make the result a vector.
The result is a vector whose elements are the elements of all the arguments.
Each argument may be a list, vector or string.Fcopy-sequence
Return a copy of a list, vector or string.Fcopy-alist
Return a copy of ALIST.
This is a new alist which represents the same mapping
from objects to objects, but does not share the alist structure with ALIST.
The objects mapped (cars and cdrs of elements of the alist)
are shared, however.Fsubstring
Return a substring of STRING, starting at index FROM and ending before TO.
TO may be nil or omitted; then the substring runs to the end of STRING.
If FROM or TO is negative, it counts from the end.Fnthcdr
Takes cdr N times on LIST, returns the result.Fnth
Returns the Nth element of LIST.
N counts from zero.  If LIST is not that long, nil is returned.Felt
Returns element of SEQUENCE at index N.Fmemq
Returns non-nil if ELT is an element of LIST.  Comparison done with EQ.
The value is actually the tail of LIST whose car is ELT.Fassq

Two-character sequences are represented as described below.
The second character of S is the matching parenthesis,
 used only if the first character is ( or ).
Any additional characters are flags.
Defined flags are the characters 1, 2, 3 and 4.
 1 means C is the start of a two-char comment start sequence.
 2 means C is the second character of such a sequence.
 3 means C is the start of a two-char comment end sequence.
 4 means C is the second character of such a sequence.Fdescribe-syntax

Normally returns t.
If an edge of the buffer is reached, point is left there
and nil is returned.Fscan-lists
Scan from character number FROM by COUNT lists.
Returns the character number of the position thus found.

If DEPTH is nonzero, paren depth begins counting from that value,
only places where the depth in parentheses becomes zero
are candidates for stopping; COUNT such places are counted.
Thus, a positive value for DEPTH means go out levels.

Comments are ignored if parse-sexp-ignore-comments is non-nil.

If the beginning or end of (the visible part of) the buffer is reached
and the depth is wrong, an error is signaled.
If the depth is right but the count is not used up, nil is returned.Fscan-sexps
Scan from character number FROM by COUNT balanced expressions.
Returns the character number of the position thus found.

Comments are ignored if parse-sexp-ignore-comments is non-nil.

    (it is the character that will terminate the string.)
 5. t if inside a comment.
 6. t if following a quote character.
 7. the minimum paren-depth encountered during this scan.
If third arg TARGETDEPTH is non-nil, parsing stops if the depth
in parentheses becomes equal to TARGETDEPTH.
Fourth arg STOPBEFORE non-nil means stop when come to
 any character that starts a sexp.
Fifth arg STATE is a seven-list like what this function returns.
It is used to initialize the state of the parse.Vparse-sexp-ignore-comments
Non-nil means forward-sexp, etc., should treat comments as whitespace.
Non-nil works only when the comment terminator is something like */,
and appears only when it ends a comment.
If comments are terminated by newlines,
you must make this variable nil.Fml-if

Kill between point and mark.
The text is deleted but saved in the kill ring.
The command \[yank] can retrieve it from there.
(If you want to kill and then yank immediately, use \[copy-region-as-kill].)

This is the primitive for programs to kill text (as opposed to deleting it).
Supply two arguments, character numbers indicating the stretch of text
 to be killed.
Any command that calls this function is a "kill command".
If the previous command was also a kill command,
the text killed this time appends to the text killed last time
to make one entry in the kill ring.Fcopy-region-as-kill
Save the region as if killed, but don't kill it.Fappend-next-kill
Cause following command, if kill, to append to previous kill.Frotate-yank-pointer

This command is allowed only immediately after a  yank  or a  yank-pop.
At such a time, the region contains a stretch of reinserted
previously-killed text.  yank-pop  deletes that text and inserts in its
place a different stretch of killed text.

With no argument, the previous kill is inserted.
With argument n, the n'th previous kill is inserted.
If n is negative, this is a more recent kill.

The sequence of kills wraps around, so that after the oldest one
comes the newest one.Fyank
Reinsert the last stretch of killed text.
More precisely, reinsert the stretch of killed text most recently
killed OR yanked.
With just C-U as argument, same but put point in front (and mark at end).
With argument n, reinsert the nth most recently killed stretch of killed
text.
See also the command \[yank-pop].Finsert-buffer
Insert after point the contents of BUFFER.
Puts mark after the inserted text.
BUFFER may be a buffer or a buffer name.Fappend-to-buffer
Append to specified buffer the text of the region.
It is inserted into that buffer before its point.

When calling from a program, give three arguments:
a buffer or the name of one, and two character numbers
specifying the portion of the current buffer to be copied.Fprepend-to-buffer
Prepend to specified buffer the text of the region.
It is inserted into that buffer after its point.

When calling from a program, give three arguments:
a buffer or the name of one, and two character numbers
specifying the portion of the current buffer to be copied.Fcopy-to-buffer
Copy to specified buffer the text of the region.
It is inserted into that buffer, replacing existing text there.

When calling from a program, give three arguments:
a buffer or the name of one, and two character numbers
specifying the portion of the current buffer to be copied.Fmark
Return this buffer's mark value as integer, or nil if no mark.
If you are using this in an editing command, you are most likely making
a mistake; see the documentation of `set-mark'.Fset-mark
Set this buffer's mark to POS.  Don't use this function!
That is to say, don't use this function unless you want
the user to see that the mark has moved, and you want the previous
mark position to be lost.

Normally, when a new mark is set, the old one should go on the stack.
This is why most applications should use push-mark, not set-mark.

Novice emacs-lisp programmers often try to use the mark for the wrong
purposes.  The mark saves a location for the user's convenience.
Most editing commands should not alter the mark.
To remember a location for internal use in the Lisp program,
store it in a Lisp variable.  Example:

   (let ((beg (point))) (forward-line 1) (delete-region beg (point))).Vmark-ring
The list of saved former marks of the current buffer,
most recent first.Vmark-ring-max
*Maximum size of mark ring.  Start discarding off end if gets this big.Fset-mark-command
Set mark at where point is, or jump to mark.
With no prefix argument, set mark, and push previous mark on mark ring.
With argument, jump to mark, and pop into mark off the mark ring.

Novice emacs-lisp programmers often try to use the mark for the wrong
purposes.  See the documentation of `set-mark' for more information.Fpush-mark
Set mark at LOCATION (point, by default) and push old mark on mark ring.
Displays "Mark set" unless the optional second arg NOMSG is non-nil.

Novice emacs-lisp programmers often try to use the mark for the wrong
purposes.  See the documentation of `set-mark' for more information.Fpop-mark
Pop off mark ring into the buffer's actual mark.
Does not set point.  Does nothing if mark ring is empty.Fexchange-point-and-mark
Put the mark where point is now, and point where the mark is now.Fnext-line
Move cursor vertically down ARG lines.
If there is no character in the target line exactly under the current column,
the cursor is positioned after the character in that line which spans this
column, or at the end of the line if it is not long enough.
If there is no line in the buffer after this one,
a newline character is inserted to create a line
and the cursor moves to that line.

The command \[set-goal-column] can be used to create
a semipermanent goal column to which this command always moves.
Then it does not try to move vertically.

If you are thinking of using this in a Lisp program, consider
using `forward-line' instead.  It is usually easier to use
and more reliable (no dependence on goal column, etc.).Fprevious-line
Move cursor vertically up ARG lines.
If there is no character in the target line exactly over the current column,
the cursor is positioned after the character in that line which spans this
column, or at the end of the line if it is not long enough.

The command \[set-goal-column] can be used to create
a semipermanent goal column to which this command always moves.
Then it does not try to move vertically.

If you are thinking of using this in a Lisp program, consider using
`forward-line' with negative argument instead..  It is usually easier
to use and more reliable (no dependence on goal column, etc.).Vtrack-eol
*Non-nil means vertical motion starting at the end of a line should keep to ends of lines.
This means moving to the end of each line moved onto.Vgoal-column
*Semipermanent goal column for vertical motion, as set by \[set-goal-column], or nil.Vtemporary-goal-column
Current goal column for vertical motion.
It is the column where point was at the start of current run of vertical motion commands.Fset-goal-column
Set the current horizontal position as a goal for \[next-line] and \[previous-line].
Those commands will move to this position in the line moved to
rather than trying to keep the same horizontal position.
With a non-nil argument, clears out the goal column
so that \[next-line] and \[previous-line] resume vertical motion.Ftranspose-chars
Interchange characters around point, moving forward one character.
With prefix arg ARG, effect is to take character before point
and drag it forward past ARG other characters (backward if ARG negative).
If no argument and at end of line, the previous two chars are exchanged.Ftranspose-words
Interchange words around point, leaving point at end of them.
With prefix arg ARG, effect is to take word before or around point
and drag it forward past ARG other words (backward if ARG negative).
If ARG is zero, the words around or after point and around or after mark
are interchanged.Ftranspose-sexps
Like \[transpose-words] but applies to sexps.
Does not work on a sexp that point is in the middle of
if it is a list or string.Ftranspose-lines
Exchange current line and previous line, leaving point after both.
With argument ARG, takes previous line and moves it past ARG lines.
With argument 0, interchanges line point is in with line mark is in.Vcomment-column
*Column to indent right-margin comments to.
Setting this variable automatically makes it local to the current buffer.Vcomment-start
*String to insert to start a new comment, or nil if no comment syntax defined.Vcomment-start-skip
*Regexp to match the start of a comment plus everything up to its body.
If there are any \(...\) pairs, the comment delimiter text is held to begin
at the place matched by the close of the first pair.Vcomment-end
*String to insert to end a new comment.
Should be an empty string if comments are terminated by end-of-line.Vcomment-indent-hook
Function to compute desired indentation for a comment
given the character number it starts at.Findent-for-comment
Indent this line's comment to comment column, or insert an empty comment.Fset-comment-column
Set the comment column based on point.
With no arg, set the comment column to the current column.
With just minus as arg, kill any comment on this line.
With any other arg, set comment column to indentation of the previous comment
 and then align or create a comment on this line at that column.Fkill-comment
Kill the comment on this line, if any.
With argument, kill comments on that many lines starting with this one.Fbackward-word
Move backward until encountering the end of a word.
With argument, do this that many times.
In programs, it is faster to call forward-word with negative arg.Fmark-word
Set mark arg words away from point.Fkill-word
Kill characters forward until encountering the end of a word.
With argument, do this that many times.Fbackward-kill-word
Kill characters backward until encountering the end of a word.
With argument, do this that many times.Vfill-prefix
*String for filling to insert at front of new line, or nil for none.
Setting this variable automatically makes it local to the current buffer.Vcomment-multi-line
*Non-nil means \[indent-new-comment-line] should continue same comment
on new line, with no new terminator or starter.Findent-new-comment-line
Break line at point and indent, continuing comment if presently within one.
The body of the continued comment is indented under the previous comment line.Fauto-fill-mode
Toggle auto-fill mode.
With arg, turn auto-fill mode on iff arg is positive.
In auto-fill mode, inserting a space at a column beyond  fill-column
automatically breaks the line at a previous space.Fturn-on-auto-fill
Unconditionally turn on Auto Fill mode.Fset-fill-column
Set fill-column to current column, or to argument if given.
fill-column's value is separate for each buffer.Fset-selective-display
Set selective-display to ARG; clear it if no arg.
When selective-display is a number > 0,
lines whose indentation is >= selective-display are not displayed.
selective-display's value is separate for each buffer.Foverwrite-mode
Toggle overwrite mode.
With arg, turn overwrite mode on iff arg is positive.
In overwrite mode, printing characters typed in replace existing text
on a one-for-one basis, rather than pushing it to the right.Vblink-matching-paren
*Non-nil means show matching open-paren when close-paren is inserted.Vblink-matching-paren-distance
*If non-nil, is maximum distance to search for matching open-paren
when close-paren is inserted.Fblink-matching-open
Move cursor momentarily to the beginning of the sexp before point.Fkeyboard-quit
Signal a  quit  condition.Fset-variable
Set VARIABLE to VALUE.  VALUE is a Lisp object.
When using this interactively, supply a Lisp expression for VALUE.
If you want VALUE to be a string, you must surround it with doublequotes.Vmode-specific-map
Keymap for characters following C-c.Vhelp-map
Keymap for characters following the Help key.Fhelp-with-tutorial
Select the Emacs learn-by-doing tutorial.Fdescribe-key-briefly
Print the name of the function KEY invokes.  KEY is a string.Fprint-help-return-message
Display or return message saying how to restore windows after help command.
Computes a message and applies the argument FUNCTION to it.
If FUNCTION is nil, applies `message' to it, thus printing it.Fdescribe-key
Display documentation of the function KEY invokes.  KEY is a string.Fdescribe-mode
Display documentation of current major mode.Fdescribe-distribution
Display info on how to obtain the latest version of GNU Emacs.Fdescribe-copying
Display info on how you may redistribute copies of GNU Emacs.Fdescribe-no-warranty
Display info on all the kinds of warranty Emacs does NOT have.Fview-emacs-news
Display info on recent changes to Emacs.Fview-lossage
Display last 100 input keystrokes.Fhelp-for-help

Display the full documentation of FUNCTION (a symbol).Fdescribe-variable
Display the full documentation of VARIABLE (a symbol).Fcommand-apropos
Like apropos but lists only symbols that are names of commands
(interactively callable functions).Vdelete-auto-save-files
*Non-nil means delete a buffer's auto-save file
when the buffer is saved for real.Vmake-backup-files
*Create a backup of each file when it is saved for the first time.
This can be done by renaming the file or by copying.

Renaming means that Emacs renames the existing file so that it is a
backup file, then writes the buffer into a new file.  Any other names
that the old file had will now refer to the backup file.
The new file is owned by you and its group is defaulted.

Copying means that Emacs copies the existing file into the backup file,
then writes the buffer on top of the existing file.  Any other names
that the old file had will now refer to the new (edited) file.
The file's owner and group are unchanged.

The choice of renaming or copying is controlled by the variables
backup-by-copying, backup-by-copying-when-linked and
backup-by-copying-when-mismatch.Vbackup-by-copying
*Non-nil means always use copying to create backup files.
See documentation of variable  make-backup-files.Vbackup-by-copying-when-linked
*Non-nil means use copying to create backups for files with multiple names.
This causes the alternate names to refer to the latest version as edited.
This variable is relevant only if  backup-by-copying  is nil.Vbackup-by-copying-when-mismatch
*Non-nil means create backups by copying if this preserves owner or group.
Renaming may still be used (subject to control of other variables)
when it would not result in changing the owner or group of the file;
that is, for files which are owned by you and whose group matches
the default for a new file created there by you.
This variable is relevant only if  backup-by-copying  is nil.Vbuffer-offer-save
*Non-nil in a buffer means offer to save the buffer on exit
even if the buffer is not visiting a file.  Automatically local in
all buffers.Vfile-precious-flag
*Non-nil means protect against I/O errors while saving files.
Some modes set this non-nil in particular buffers.Vversion-control
*Control use of version numbers for backup files.
t means make numeric backup versions unconditionally.
nil means make them for files that have some already.
never means do not make them.Vdired-kept-versions
*When cleaning directory, number of versions to keep.Vtrim-versions-without-asking
*If true, deletes excess backup versions silently.
Otherwise asks confirmation.Vkept-old-versions
*Number of oldest versions to keep when a new numbered backup is made.Vkept-new-versions
*Number of newest versions to keep when a new numbered backup is made.
Includes the new backup.  Must be > 0Vrequire-final-newline
*t says silently put a newline at the end whenever a file is saved.
Non-nil but not t says ask user whether to add a newline in each such case.
nil means don't add newlines.Vauto-save-default
*t says by default do auto-saving of every file-visiting buffer.Vauto-save-visited-file-name
*t says auto-save a buffer in the file it is visiting, when practical.
Normally auto-save files are written under other names.Vsave-abbrevs
*Non-nil means save word abbrevs too when files are saved.
Loading an abbrev file sets this to t.Vfind-file-run-dired
*Non-nil says run dired if find-file is given the name of a directory.Vfind-file-not-found-hooks
List of functions to be called for find-file on nonexistent file.
These functions are called as soon as the error is detected.
buffer-file-name is already set up.
The functions are called in the order given,
until one of them returns non-nil.Vfind-file-hooks
List of functions to be called after a buffer is loaded from a file.
The buffer's local variables (if any) will have been processed before the
functions are called.Vwrite-file-hooks
List of functions to be called before writing out a buffer to a file.
If one of them returns non-nil, the file is considered already written
and the rest are not called.Vinhibit-local-variables
*Non-nil means query before obeying a file's local-variables list.
This applies when the local-variables list is scanned automatically
after you find a file.  If you explicitly request such a scan with
\[normal-mode], there is no query, regardless of this variable.Fpwd
Show the current default directory.Fcd
Make DIR become the current buffer's default directory.Fload-file
Load the file FILE of Lisp code.Fload-library
Load the library named LIBRARY.
This is an interface to the function `load'.Fswitch-to-buffer-other-window
Select buffer BUFFER in another window.Ffind-file
Edit file FILENAME.
Switch to a buffer visiting file FILENAME,
creating one if none already exists.Ffind-file-other-window
Edit file FILENAME, in another window.
May create a new window, or reuse an existing one;
see the function display-buffer.Ffind-file-read-only
Edit file FILENAME but don't save without confirmation.
Like find-file but marks buffer as read-only.Ffind-alternate-file
Find file FILENAME, select its buffer, kill previous buffer.
If the current buffer now contains an empty file that you just visited
(presumably by mistake), use this command to visit the file you really want.Fcreate-file-buffer
Create a suitably named buffer for visiting FILENAME, and return it.
FILENAME (sans directory) is used unchanged if that name is free;
otherwise a string <2> or <3> or ... is appended to get an unused name.Ffind-file-noselect
Read file FILENAME into a buffer and return the buffer.
If a buffer exists visiting FILENAME, return that one,
but verify that the file has not changed since visited or saved.
The buffer is not selected, just returned to the caller.Fafter-find-file
Called after finding a file and by the default revert function.
Sets buffer mode, parses local variables.
Optional args ERROR and WARN: ERROR non-nil means there was an
error in reading the file.  WARN non-nil means warn if there
exists an auto-save file more recent than the visited file.
Finishes by calling the functions in find-file-hooks.Fnormal-mode
Choose the major mode for this buffer automatically.
Also sets up any specified local variables of the file.
Uses the visited file name, the -*- line, and the local variables spec.

This function is called automatically from `find-file'.  In that case,
if `inhibit-local-variables' is non-`nil' we require confirmation before
processing a local variables spec.  If you run `normal-mode' explicitly,
confirmation is never required.Fset-auto-mode
Select major mode appropriate for current buffer.
May base decision on visited file name (See variable  auto-mode-list)
or on buffer contents (-*- line or local variables spec), but does not look
for the "mode:" local variable.  For that, use  hack-local-variables.Fhack-local-variables
Parse, and bind or evaluate as appropriate, any local variables
for current buffer.Fset-visited-file-name
Change name of file visited in current buffer to FILENAME.
The next time the buffer is saved it will go in the newly specified file.
nil or empty string as argument means make buffer not be visiting any file.
Remember to delete the initial contents of the minibuffer
if you wish to pass an empty string as the argument.Fwrite-file
Write current buffer into file FILENAME.
Makes buffer visit that file, and marks it not modified.Fbackup-buffer
Make a backup of the disk file visited by the current buffer, if appropriate.
This is normally done before saving the buffer the first time.
If the value is non-nil, it is the result of `file-modes' on the original file;
this means that the caller, after saving the buffer, should change the modes
of the new file to agree with the old modes.Ffile-name-sans-versions
Return FILENAME sans backup versions or strings.
This is a separate procedure so your site-init or startup file can
redefine it.Fmake-backup-file-name
Create the non-numeric backup file name for FILE.
This is a separate function so you can redefine it for customization.Fbackup-file-name-p
Return non-nil if FILE is a backup file name (numeric or not).
This is a separate function so you can redefine it for customization.
You may need to redefine file-name-sans-versions as well.Ffind-backup-file-name
Find a file name for a backup file, and suggestions for deletions.
Value is a list whose car is the name for the backup file
 and whose cdr is a list of old versions to consider deleting now.Ffile-nlinks
Return number of names file FILENAME has.Fsave-buffer
Save current buffer in visited file if modified.  Versions described below.

By default, makes the previous version into a backup file
 if previously requested or if this is the first save.
With 1 or 3 \[universal-argument]'s, marks this version
 to become a backup when the next save is done.
With 2 or 3 \[universal-argument]'s,
 unconditionally makes the previous version into a backup file.
With argument of 0, never makes the previous version into a backup file.

If a file's name is FOO, the names of its numbered backup versions are
 FOO.~i~ for various integers i.  A non-numbered backup file is called FOO~.
Numeric backups (rather than FOO~) will be made if value of
 `version-control' is not the atom `never' and either there are already
 numeric versions of the file being backed up, or `version-control' is
 non-nil.
We don't want excessive versions piling up, so there are variables
 `kept-old-versions', which tells Emacs how many oldest versions to keep,
 and `kept-new-versions', which tells how many newest versions to keep.
 Defaults are 2 old versions and 2 new.
`dired-kept-versions' controls dired's clean-directory (.) command.
If `trim-versions-without-asking' is nil, system will query user
 before trimming versions.  Otherwise it does it silently.Fdelete-auto-save-file-if-necessary
Delete the auto-save filename for the current buffer (if it has one)
if variable  delete-auto-save-files  is non-nil.Fbasic-save-buffer
Save the current buffer in its visited file, if it has been modified.Fsave-some-buffers
Save some modified file-visiting buffers.  Asks user about each one.
With argument, saves all with no questions.Fnot-modified
Mark current buffer as unmodified, not needing to be saved.Ftoggle-read-only
Change whether this buffer is visiting its file read-only.Finsert-file
Insert contents of file FILENAME into buffer after point.
Set mark after the inserted text.Fappend-to-file
Append the contents of the region to the end of file FILENAME.
When called from a function, expects three arguments,
START, END and FILENAME.  START and END are buffer positions
saying what text to write.Vrevert-buffer-function
Function to use to revert this buffer, or nil to do the default.Frevert-buffer
Replace the buffer text with the text of the visited file on disk.
This undoes all changes since the file was visited or saved.
If latest auto-save file is more recent than the visited file,
asks user whether to use that instead.
First argument (optional) non-nil means don't offer to use auto-save file.
 This is the prefix arg when called interactively.

Second argument (optional) non-nil means don't ask for confirmation at all.

If revert-buffer-function's value is non-nil, it is called to do the work.Frecover-file
Visit file FILE, but get contents from its last auto-save file.Fkill-some-buffers
For each buffer, ask whether to kill it.Fauto-save-mode
Toggle auto-saving of contents of current buffer.
With arg, turn auto-saving on if arg is positive, else off.Frename-auto-save-file
Adjust current buffer's auto save file name for current conditions.
Also rename any existing auto save file.Fmake-auto-save-file-name
Return file name to use for auto-saves of current buffer.
Does not consider auto-save-visited-file-name; that is checked
before calling this function.
You can redefine this for customization.
See also auto-save-file-name-p.Fauto-save-file-name-p
Return non-nil if FILENAME can be yielded by make-auto-save-file-name.
FILENAME should lack slashes.
You can redefine this for customization.Vlist-directory-brief-switches
*Switches for list-directory to pass to `ls' for brief listing,Vlist-directory-verbose-switches
*Switches for list-directory to pass to `ls' for verbose listing,Flist-directory
Display a list of files in or matching DIRNAME, a la `ls'.
DIRNAME is globbed by the shell if necessary.
Prefix arg (second arg if noninteractive) means supply -l switch to `ls'.
Actions controlled by variables list-directory-brief-switches
 and list-directory-verbose-switches.Fsave-buffers-kill-emacs
Offer to save each buffer, then kill this Emacs fork.
With prefix arg, silently save all file-visiting buffers, then kill.Vctl-x-4-map
Keymap for subcommands of C-x 4Fsplit-window-vertically
Split current window into two windows, one above the other.
This window becomes the uppermost of the two, and gets
ARG lines.  No arg means split equally.Fsplit-window-horizontally
Split current window into two windows side by side.
This window becomes the leftmost of the two, and gets
ARG columns.  No arg means split equally.Fenlarge-window-horizontally
Make current window ARG columns wider.Fshrink-window-horizontally
Make current window ARG columns narrower.Findent-according-to-mode
Indent line in proper way for current major mode.Findent-for-tab-command
Indent line in proper way for current major mode.Findent-rigidly
Indent all lines starting in the region sideways by ARG columns.
Called from a program, takes three arguments, START, END and ARG.Vindent-region-function
Function which is short cut to indent each line in region with Tab.
nil means really call Tab on each line.Findent-region
Indent each nonblank line in the region.
With no argument, indent each line with Tab.
With argument COLUMN, indent each line to that column.
Called from a program, takes three args: START, END and COLUMN.Findent-relative-maybe
Indent a new line like previous nonblank line.Findent-relative
Space out to under next indent point in previous nonblank line.
An indent point is a non-whitespace character following whitespace.
If the previous nonblank line has no indent points beyond
the column point starts at,  tab-to-tab-stop  is done instead.Vtab-stop-list
*List of tab stop positions used by tab-to-tab-stops.Vedit-tab-stops-map
Keymap used in edit-tab-stops.Vedit-tab-stops-buffer
Buffer whose tab stops are being edited--in case
the variable tab-stop-list is local in that buffer.Fedit-tab-stops
Edit the tab stops used by tab-to-tab-stop.
Creates a buffer *Tab Stops* containing text describing the tab stops.
A colon indicates a column where there is a tab stop.
You can add or remove colons and then do C-c C-c to make changes take effect.Fedit-tab-stops-note-changes
Put edited tab stops into effect.Ftab-to-tab-stop
Insert spaces or tabs to next defined tab-stop column.
The variable tab-stop-list is a list of columns at which there are tab stops.
Use \[edit-tab-stops] to edit them interactively.Vmode-line-buffer-identification
Mode-line control for identifying the buffer being displayed.
Its default value is "Emacs: %17b".  Major modes that edit things
other than ordinary files may change this (e.g. Info, Dired,...)Vmode-line-process
Mode-line control for displaying info on process status.
Normally nil in most modes, since there is no process to display.Vmode-line-modified
Mode-line control for displaying whether current buffer is modified.Vminor-mode-alist
Alist saying how to show minor modes in the mode line.
Each element looks like (VARIABLE STRING);
STRING is included in the mode line iff VARIABLE's value is non-nil.Vfunction-keymap

If you change this, you may have to change paragraph-start also.Vsentence-end
*Regexp describing the end of a sentence.
All paragraph boundaries also end sentences, regardless.Vpage-delimiter
*Regexp describing line-beginnings that separate pages.Vcase-replace
*Non-nil means query-replace should preserve case in replacements.Vindent-line-function
Function to indent current line.Vonly-global-abbrevs

Anything from beginning of line up to the end of what this pattern matches
is deemed to be prompt, and is not reexecuted.Vledit-save-files
*Non-nil means Ledit should save files before transferring to Lisp.Vledit-go-to-lisp-string
*Shell commands to execute to resume Lisp job.Vledit-go-to-liszt-string
*Shell commands to execute to resume Lisp compiler job.Vdisplay-time-day-and-date
*Non-nil means M-x display-time should display day and date as well as time.Vauto-mode-alist
Alist of filename patterns vs corresponding major mode functions.
Each element looks like (REGEXP . FUNCTION).
Visiting a file whose name matches REGEXP causes FUNCTION to be called.Vctl-x-4-map
Keymap for subcommands of C-x 4Fadd-change-log-entry
Find change log file and add an entry for today.
First arg (interactive prefix) non-nil means prompt for user name and site.
Second arg is file name of change log.
Optional third arg OTHER-WINDOW non-nil means visit in other window.Fadd-change-log-entry-other-window
Find change log file in other window, and add an entry for today.F`
(` FORM) Expands to a form that will generate FORM.
FORM is `almost quoted' -- see backquote.el for a description.Fbyte-compile-file
Compile a file of Lisp code named FILENAME into a file of byte code.
The output file's name is made by appending "c" to the end of FILENAME.Fbyte-recompile-directory
Recompile every .el file in DIRECTORY that needs recompilation.
This is if a .elc file exists but is older than the .el file.
If the .elc file does not exist, offer to compile the .el file
only if a prefix argument has been specified.Fbatch-byte-compile
Runs byte-compile-file on the files remaining on the command line.
Must be used only with -batch, and kills emacs on completion.
Each file will be processed even if an error occurred previously.
For example, invoke "emacs -batch -f batch-byte-compile $emacs/ ~/*.el"Fcalendar
Display three-month calendar in another window.
The three months appear side by side, with the current month in the middle
surrounded by the previous and next months.  The cursor is put on today's date.

An optional prefix argument ARG causes the calendar displayed to be
ARG months in the future if ARG is positive or in the past if ARG is
negative; in this case the cursor goes on the first day of the month.

The Gregorian calendar is assumed.

After preparing the calendar window, the hooks calendar-hook are run
when the calendar is for the current month--that is, the was no prefix
argument.  If the calendar is for a future or past month--that is, there
was a prefix argument--the hooks offset-calendar-hook are run.  Thus, for
example, setting calendar-hooks to 'star-date will cause today's date to be
replaced by asterisks to highlight it in the window.Flist-command-history
List history of commands typed to minibuffer.
The number of commands listed is controlled by  list-command-history-max.
Calls value of  list-command-history-filter  (if non-nil) on each history
element to judge if that element should be excluded from the list.

The buffer is left in Command History mode.Fcommand-history-mode
Major mode for examining commands from  command-history.
The number of commands listed is controlled by  list-command-history-max.
The command history is filtered by  list-command-history-filter  if non-nil.

Like Emacs-Lisp Mode except that characters do not insert themselves and
Digits provide prefix arguments.  Tab does not indent.
\{command-history-map}
Calls the value of  command-history-hook  if that is non-nil
The Command History listing is recomputed each time this mode is
invoked.Frepeat-matching-complex-command
Edit and re-evaluate complex command with name matching PATTERN.
Matching occurrences are displayed, most recent first, until you
select a form for evaluation.  If PATTERN is empty (or nil), every form
in the command history is offered.  The form is placed in the minibuffer
for editing and the result is evaluated.Fcompare-windows
Compare text in current window with text in next window.
Compares the text starting at point in each window,
moving over text in each one as far as they match.Fcompile
Compile the program including the current buffer.  Default: run `make'.
Runs COMMAND, a shell command, in a separate process asynchronously
with output going to the buffer *compilation*.
You can then use the command \[next-error] to find the next error message
and move to the source code that caused it.Fgrep
Run grep, with user-specified args, and collect output in a buffer.
While grep runs asynchronously, you can use the \[next-error] command
to find the text that grep hits refer to.Fnext-error
Visit next compilation error message and corresponding source code.
This operates on the output from the \[compile] command.
If all preparsed error messages have been processed,
the error message buffer is checked for new ones.
A non-nil argument (prefix arg, if interactive)
means reparse the error message buffer and start at the first error.Fdabbrev-expand
Expand previous word "dynamically".
Expands to the most recent, preceding word for which this is a prefix.
If no suitable preceding word is found, words following point are considered.

A positive prefix argument, N, says to take the Nth backward DISTINCT
possibility.  A negative argument says search forward.  The variable
dabbrev-backward-only may be used to limit the direction of search to
backward if set non-nil.

If the cursor has not moved from the end of the previous expansion and
no argument is given, replace the previously-made expansion
with the next possible expansion not yet tried.Fdebug
Enter debugger.  Returns if user says "continue".
Arguments are mainly for use when this is called
 from the internals of the evaluator.
You may call with no args, or you may
 pass nil as the first arg and any other args you like.
 In that case, the list of args after the first will 
 be printed into the backtrace buffer.Fcancel-debug-on-entry
Undoes effect of debug-on-entry on FUNCTION.Fdebug-on-entry
Request FUNCTION to invoke debugger each time it is called.
If the user continues, FUNCTION's execution proceeds.
Works by modifying the definition of FUNCTION,
which must be written in Lisp, not predefined.
Use `cancel-debug-on-entry' to cancel the effect of this command.
Redefining FUNCTION also does that.Fdired
"Edit" directory DIRNAME--delete, rename, print, etc. some files in it.
Dired displays a list of files in DIRNAME.
You can move around in it with the usual commands.
You can flag files for deletion with C-d
and then delete them by typing `x'.
Type `h' after entering dired for more info.Fdired-other-window
"Edit" directory DIRNAME.  Like \[dired] but selects in another window.Fdired-noselect
Like M-x dired but returns the dired buffer as value, does not select it.Fdissociated-press
Dissociate the text of the current buffer.
Output goes in buffer named *Dissociation*,
which is redisplayed each time text is added to it.
Every so often the user must say whether to continue.
If ARG is positive, require ARG chars of continuity.
If ARG is negative, require -ARG words of continuity.
Default is 2.Fdoctor
Switch to *doctor* buffer and start giving psychotherapy.Fdisassemble
Print disassembled code for OBJECT on (optional) STREAM.
OBJECT can be a function name, lambda expression or any function object
returned by SYMBOL-FUNCTION.  If OBJECT is not already compiled, we will
compile it (but not redefine it).Felectric-buffer-list
Vaguely like ITS lunar select buffer;
combining typeoutoid buffer listing with menuoid buffer selection.

This pops up a buffer describing the set of emacs buffers.
If the very next character typed is a space then the buffer list
 window disappears.

Otherwise, one may move around in the buffer list window, marking
 buffers to be selected, saved or deleted.

To exit and select a new buffer, type Space when the cursor is on the
 appropriate line of the buffer-list window.

Other commands are much like those of buffer-menu-mode.

Calls value of  electric-buffer-menu-mode-hook  on entry if non-nil.

\{electric-buffer-menu-mode-map}Felectric-command-history
Major mode for examining and redoing commands from  command-history.
The number of command listed is controlled by  list-command-history-max.
The command history is filtered by  list-command-history-filter  if non-nil.
Combines typeout Command History list window with menu like selection
of an expression from the history for re-evaluation in the *original* buffer.

The history displayed is filtered by  list-command-history-filter  if non-nil.

This pops up a window with the Command History listing.  If the very
next character typed is Space, the listing is killed and the previous
window configuration is restored.  Otherwise, you can browse in the
Command History with  Return  moving down and  Delete  moving up, possibly
selecting an expression to be redone with Space or quitting with `Q'.

Like Emacs-Lisp Mode except that characters do not insert themselves and
Tab and linefeed do not indent.  Instead these commands are provided:
Space or !	edit then evaluate current line in history inside
		   the ORIGINAL buffer which invoked this mode.
		   The previous window configuration is restored
		   unless the invoked command changes it.
C-c C-c, C-], Q	Quit and restore previous window configuration.
LFD, RET	Move to the next line in the history.
DEL		Move to the previous line in the history.
?		Provides a complete list of commands.

Calls the value of  electric-command-history-hook  if that is non-nil
The Command History listing is recomputed each time this mode is invoked.Fedt-emulation-on
Begin emulating DEC's EDT editor.
Certain keys are rebound; including nearly all keypad keys.
Use \[edt-emulation-off] to undo all rebindings except the keypad keys.
Note that this function does not work if called directly from the .emacs file.
Instead, the .emacs file should do (setq term-setup-hook 'edt-emulation-on)
Then this function will be called at the time when it will work.Ffortran-mode
Major mode for editing fortran code.
Tab indents the current fortran line correctly. 
`do' statements must not share a common `continue'.

Type `;?' or `;\[help-command]' to display a list of built-in abbrevs for Fortran keywords.

 	      indentation for a line of code.
    Default value is fixed.
 fortran-comment-indent-char
    Character to be inserted instead of space for full-line comment
    indentation.  (default is a space)
 fortran-minimum-statement-indent
    Minimum indentation for fortran statements. (default 6)
 fortran-line-number-indent
    Maximum indentation for line numbers.  A line number will get
    less than this much indentation if necessary to avoid reaching
    column 5.  (default 1)
 fortran-check-all-num-for-matching-do
    Non-nil causes all numbered lines to be treated as possible 'continue'
    statements.  (default nil)
 fortran-continuation-char
    character to be inserted in column 5 of a continuation line.
    (default $)

\{fortran-mode-map}Fftp-find-file
FTP to HOST to get FILE, logging in as USER with password PASSWORD.
Interactively, HOST and FILE are specified by reading a string with
 a colon character separating the host from the filename.
USER and PASSWORD are defaulted from the values used when
 last ftping from HOST (unless password-remembering is disabled).
 Supply a password of the symbol `t' to override this default
 (interactively, this is done by giving a prefix arg)Fftp-write-file
FTP to HOST to write FILE, logging in as USER with password PASSWORD.
Interactively, HOST and FILE are specified by reading a string with colon
separating the host from the filename.
USER and PASSWORD are defaulted from the values used when
 last ftping from HOST (unless password-remembering is disabled).
 Supply a password of the symbol `t' to override this default
 (interactively, this is done by giving a prefix arg)Fgdb
Run gdb on program FILE in buffer *gdb-FILE*.
The directory containing FILE becomes the initial working directory
and source-file directory for GDB.  If you wish to change this, use
the GDB commands `cd DIR' and `directory'.Fset-gosmacs-bindings
Rebind some keys globally to make GNU Emacs resemble Gosling Emacs.
Use \[set-gnu-bindings] to restore previous global bindings.Fhanoi

Check that every node pointer points to an existing node.FInfo-split
Split an info file into an indirect file plus bounded-size subfiles.
Each subfile will be up to 50000 characters plus one node.

To use this command, first visit a large Info file that has a tag table.
The buffer is modified into a (small) indirect info file
which should be saved in place of the original visited file.

The subfiles are written in the same directory the original file is in,
with names generated by appending `-' and a number to the original file name.

The indirect file still functions as an Info file, but it contains
just the tag table and a directory of subfiles.Fbatch-info-validate
Runs  Info-validate  on the files remaining on the command line.
Must be used only with -batch, and kills emacs on completion.
Each file will be processed even if an error occurred previously.
For example, invoke "emacs -batch -f batch-info-validate $info/ ~/*.info"Fledit-mode
Major mode for editing text and stuffing it to a Lisp job.
Like Lisp mode, plus these special commands:
  M-C-d	-- record defun at or after point
	   for later transmission to Lisp job.
  M-C-r -- record region for later transmission to Lisp job.
  C-x z -- transfer to Lisp job and transmit saved text.
  M-C-c -- transfer to Liszt (Lisp compiler) job
	   and transmit saved text.

`lpr-switches' is a list of extra switches (strings) to pass to lpr.Finsert-kbd-macro
Insert in buffer the definition of kbd macro NAME, as Lisp code.
Second argument KEYS non-nil means also record the keys it is on.
 (This is the prefix argument, when calling interactively.)

This Lisp code will, when executed, define the kbd macro with the
same definition it has now.  If you say to record the keys,
the Lisp code will also rebind those keys to the macro.
Only global key bindings are recorded since executing this Lisp code
always makes global bindings.

To save a kbd macro, visit a file of Lisp code such as your ~/.emacs,
use this command, and then save the file.Fkbd-macro-query
Query user during kbd macro execution.
With prefix argument, enters recursive edit,
 reading keyboard commands even within a kbd macro.
 You can give different commands each time the macro executes.
Without prefix argument, reads a character.  Your options are:
 Space -- execute the rest of the macro.
 DEL -- skip the rest of the macro; start next repetition.
 C-d -- skip rest of the macro and don't repeat it any more.
 C-r -- enter a recursive edit, then on exit ask again for a character
 C-l -- redisplay screen and ask again.Fname-last-kbd-macro
Assign a name to the last keyboard macro defined.
One arg, a symbol, which is the name to define.
The symbol's function definition becomes the keyboard macro string.
Such a "function" cannot be called from Lisp, but it is a valid command
definition for the editor command loop.Fmake-command-summary
Make a summary of current key bindings in the buffer *Summary*.
Previous contents of that buffer are killed first.Fdefine-mail-alias
Define NAME as a mail-alias that translates to DEFINITION.Fmanual-entry

  Control-c p procedure     Control-c Control-w with
  Control-c r record        Control-c s stdio
  Control-c t type          Control-c u until
  Control-c v var           Control-c w while
  Control-c x export        Control-c y import
  Control-c { begin-comment Control-c } end-comment
  Control-c Control-z suspend-emacs     Control-c Control-t toggle
  Control-c Control-c compile           Control-x ` next-error
  Control-c Control-l link

Selects a buffer containing such a list,
in which there are commands to set the option values.
Type \[describe-mode] in that buffer for a list of commands.Foutline-mode
Set major mode for editing outlines with selective display.
Headings are lines which start with asterisks: one for major headings,
two for subheadings, etc.  Lines not starting with asterisks are body lines. 

Body text or subheadings under a heading can be made temporarily
invisible, or visible again.  Invisible lines are attached to the end 
of the heading, so they move with it, if the line is killed and yanked
back.  A heading with text hidden under it is marked with an ellipsis (...).

Commands:
C-c C-n   outline-next-visible-heading      move by visible headings
C-c C-p   outline-previous-visible-heading
C-c C-f   outline-forward-same-level        similar but skip subheadings
C-c C-b   outline-backward-same-level
C-c C-u   outline-up-heading		    move from subheading to heading

Meta-x hide-body	make all text invisible (not headings).
Meta-x show-all		make everything in buffer visible.

The remaining commands are used when point is on a heading line.
They apply to some of the body or subheadings of that heading.
C-c C-h   hide-subtree	make body and subheadings invisible.
C-c C-s   show-subtree	make body and subheadings visible.
C-c C-i   show-children	make direct subheadings visible.
		 No effect on body, or subheadings 2 or more levels down.
		 With arg N, affects subheadings N levels down.
M-x hide-entry	   make immediately following body invisible.
M-x show-entry	   make it visible.
M-x hide-leaves	   make body under heading and under its subheadings invisible.
		     The subheadings remain visible.
M-x show-branches  make all subheadings at all levels visible.

The variable outline-regexp can be changed to control what is a heading.
A line is a heading if outline-regexp matches something at the
beginning of the line.  The longer the match, the deeper the level.

Turning on outline mode calls the value of text-mode-hook and then of
outline-mode-hook, if they are non-nil.Fedit-picture

direction is right.  Whitespace is inserted and tabs are changed to
spaces when required by movement.  You can move around in the buffer
with these commands:
  C-p	  Move vertically to SAME column in previous line.
  C-n	  Move vertically to SAME column in next line.
  C-e	  Move to column following last non-whitespace character.
  C-f	  Move right inserting spaces if required.
  C-b	  Move left changing tabs to spaces if required.
  C-c C-f Move in direction of current picture motion.
  C-c C-b Move in opposite direction of current picture motion.
  Return  Move to beginning of next line.
You can edit tabular text with these commands:
  M-Tab	  Move to column beneath (or at) next interesting charecter.
	    `Indents' relative to a previous line.
  Tab	  Move to next stop in tab stop list.
  C-c Tab Set tab stops according to context of this line.
	    With ARG resets tab stops to default (global) value.
	    See also documentation of variable	picture-tab-chars
	    which defines "interesting character".  You can manually
	    change the tab stop list with command \[edit-tab-stops].
You can manipulate text with these commands:
  C-d	  Clear (replace) ARG columns after point without moving.
  C-c C-d Delete char at point - the command normally assigned to C-d.
  Delete  Clear (replace) ARG columns before point, moving back over them.
  C-k	  Clear ARG lines, advancing over them.	 The cleared
	    text is saved in the kill ring.
  C-o	  Open blank line(s) beneath current line.
You can manipulate rectangles with these commands:
  C-c C-k Clear (or kill) a rectangle and save it.
  C-c C-w Like C-c C-k except rectangle is saved in named register.
  C-c C-y Overlay (or insert) currently saved rectangle at point.
  C-c C-x Like C-c C-y except rectangle is taken from named register.
  \[copy-rectangle-to-register]   Copies a rectangle to a register.
  \[advertised-undo]   Can undo effects of rectangle overlay commands
	    commands if invoked soon enough.
You can return to the previous mode with:
  C-c C-c Which also strips trailing whitespace from every line.
	    Stripping is suppressed by supplying an argument.

Entry to this mode calls the value of  edit-picture-hook  if non-nil.

Note that Picture mode commands will work outside of Picture mode, but
they are not defaultly assigned to keys.Fprolog-mode
Major mode for editing Prolog code for Prologs.
Blank lines and `%%...' separate paragraphs.  `%'s start comments.
Commands:

The text previously in the region is not overwritten by the blanks,
but insted winds up to the right of the rectangle.Fyank-rectangle
Yank the last killed rectangle with upper left corner at point.Frnews

With argument, asks for a command line.Fscheme-mode
Major mode for editing Scheme code.
Editing commands are similar to those of lisp-mode.

In addition, if an inferior Scheme process is running, some additional
commands will be defined, for evaluating expressions and controlling
the interpreter, and the state of the process will be displayed in the
modeline of all Scheme buffers.  The names of commands that interact
with the Scheme process start with "xscheme-".  For more information
see the documentation for xscheme-interaction-mode.

Commands:
Delete converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.
Blank lines separate paragraphs.  Semicolons start comments.
\{scheme-mode-map}

  Non-nil makes Scribe mode use a different style of paragraph separation.

scribe-electric-quote
  Non-nil makes insert of double quote use `` or '' depending on context.

scribe-electric-parenthesis
  Non-nil makes an open-parenthesis char (one of `([<{')
  automatically insert its close if typed after an @Command form.Vsend-mail-function
Function to call to send the current buffer as mail.
The headers are delimited by a string found in mail-header-separator.Vmail-self-blind
*Non-nil means insert BCC to self in messages to be sent.
This is done when the message is initialized,
so you can remove or alter the BCC field to override the default.Vmail-interactive
*Non-nil means when sending a message wait for and display errors.
nil means let mailer mail back a message to report errors.Vmail-yank-ignored-headers
Delete these headers from old message when it's inserted in a reply.Vmail-header-separator
*Line used to separate headers from text in messages being composed.Vmail-archive-file-name
*Name of file to write all outgoing messages in, or nil for none.Vmail-aliases
Alias of mail address aliases,
or t meaning should be initialized from .mailrc.Fmail-other-window
Like `mail' command, but display mail buffer in another window.Fmail
Edit a message to be sent.  Argument means resume editing (don't erase).
Returns with message buffer selected; value t if message freshly initialized.
While editing message, type C-c C-c to send the message and exit.

Various special commands starting with C-c are available in sendmail mode
to move to message header fields:
\{mail-mode-map}

If mail-self-blind is non-nil, a BCC to yourself is inserted
when the message is initialized.

If mail-default-reply-to is non-nil, it should be an address (a string);
a Reply-to: field with that address is inserted.

If mail-archive-file-name is non-nil, an FCC field with that file name
is inserted.

If mail-setup-hook is bound, its value is called with no arguments
after the message is initialized.  It can add more default fields.

When calling from a program, the second through fifth arguments
 TO, SUBJECT, IN-REPLY-TO and CC specify if non-nil
 the initial contents of those header fields.
 These arguments should not have final newlines.
The sixth argument REPLYBUFFER is a buffer whose contents
 should be yanked if the user types C-c C-y.Vmail-use-rfc822
*If non-nil, use a full, hairy RFC822 parser on mail addresses.
Otherwise, (the default) use a smaller, somewhat faster and
often-correct parser.Fserver-start
Allow this Emacs process to be a server for client processes.
This starts a server communications subprocess through which
client "editors" can send your editing commands to this Emacs job.
To use the server, set up the program `etc/emacsclient' in the
Emacs distribution as your standard "editor".

Prefix arg means just kill any existing server communications subprocess.Frun-lisp
Run an inferior Lisp process, input and output via buffer *lisp*.Fshell
Run an inferior shell, with I/O through buffer *shell*.
If buffer exists but shell process is not running, make new shell.
Program used comes from variable explicit-shell-file-name,
 or (if that is nil) from the ESHELL environment variable,
 or else from SHELL if there is no ESHELL.
If a file ~/.emacs_SHELLNAME exists, it is given as initial input
 (Note that this may lose due to a timing error if the shell
  discards input when it starts up.)
The buffer is put in shell-mode, giving commands for sending input
and controlling the subjobs of the shell.  See shell-mode.
See also variable shell-prompt-pattern.

The shell file name (sans directories) is used to make a symbol name
such as `explicit-csh-arguments'.  If that symbol is a variable,
its value is used as a list of arguments when invoking the shell.
Otherwise, one argument `-i' is passed to the shell.

Note that many people's .cshrc files unconditionally clear the prompt.
If yours does, you will probably want to change it.Fsort-lines
Sort lines in region alphabetically; argument means descending order.
Called from a program, there are three arguments:
REVERSE (non-nil means reverse order), BEG and END (region to sort).Fsort-paragraphs
Sort paragraphs in region alphabetically; argument means descending order.
Called from a program, there are three arguments:
REVERSE (non-nil means reverse order), BEG and END (region to sort).Fsort-pages
Sort pages in region alphabetically; argument means descending order.
Called from a program, there are three arguments:
REVERSE (non-nil means reverse order), BEG and END (region to sort).Fsort-numeric-fields
Sort lines in region numerically by the ARGth field of each line.
Fields are separated by whitespace and numbered from 1 up.
Specified field must contain a number in each line of the region.
With a negative arg, sorts by the -ARG'th field, in reverse order.
Called from a program, there are three arguments:
FIELD, BEG and END.  BEG and END specify region to sort.Fsort-fields
Sort lines in region lexicographically by the ARGth field of each line.
Fields are separated by whitespace and numbered from 1 up.
With a negative arg, sorts by the -ARG'th field, in reverse order.
Called from a program, there are three arguments:
FIELD, BEG and END.  BEG and END specify region to sort.Fsort-columns
Sort lines in region alphabetically by a certain range of columns.
For the purpose of this command, the region includes
the entire line that point is in and the entire line the mark is in.
The column positions of point and mark bound the range of columns to sort on.
A prefix argument means sort into reverse order.

Note that sort-columns uses the sort utility program and therefore
cannot work on text containing TAB characters.  Use M-x untabify
to convert tabs to spaces before sorting.Fsort-regexp-fields
Sort the region lexicographically as specifed by RECORD-REGEXP and KEY.
RECORD-REGEXP specifies the textual units which should be sorted.
  For example, to sort lines RECORD-REGEXP would be "^.*$"
KEY specifies the part of each record (ie each match for RECORD-REGEXP)
  is to be used for sorting.
  If it is "\digit" then the digit'th "\(...\)" match field from
  RECORD-REGEXP is used.
  If it is "\&" then the whole record is used.
  Otherwise, it is a regular-expression for which to search within the record.
If a match for KEY is not found within a record then that record is ignored.

With a negative prefix arg sorts in reverse order.

For example: to sort lines in the region by the first word on each line
 starting with the letter "f",
 RECORD-REGEXP would be "^.*$" and KEY "\<f\w*\>"Fspell-buffer
Check spelling of every word in the buffer.
For each incorrect word, you are asked for the correct spelling
and then put into a query-replace to fix some or all occurrences.
If you do not want to change a word, just give the same word
as its "correct" spelling; then the query replace is skipped.Fspell-region
Like spell-buffer but applies only to region.
From program, applies from START to END.Fspell-word
Check spelling of word at or before point.
If it is not correct, ask user for the correct spelling
and query-replace the entire buffer to substitute it.Fspell-string
Check spelling of string supplied as argument.Funtabify
Convert all tabs in region to multiple spaces, preserving columns.
The variable tab-width controls the action.Ftabify
Convert multiple spaces in region to tabs when possible.
A group of spaces is partially replaced by tabs
when this can be done without changing the column they end at.
The variable tab-width controls the action.Ffind-tag
Find tag (in current tag table) whose name contains TAGNAME.
 Selects the buffer that the tag is contained in
and puts point at its definition.
 If TAGNAME is a null string, the expression in the buffer
around or before point is used as the tag name.
 If second arg NEXT is non-nil (interactively, with prefix arg),
searches for the next tag in the tag table
that matches the tagname used in the previous find-tag.

See documentation of variable tags-file-name.Ffind-tag-other-window
Find tag (in current tag table) whose name contains TAGNAME.
 Selects the buffer that the tag is contained in in another window
and puts point at its definition.
 If TAGNAME is a null string, the expression in the buffer
around or before point is used as the tag name.
 If second arg NEXT is non-nil (interactively, with prefix arg),
searches for the next tag in the tag table
that matches the tagname used in the previous find-tag.

See documentation of variable tags-file-name.Flist-tags
Display list of tags in file FILE.
FILE should not contain a directory spec
unless it has one in the tag table.Fnext-file
Select next file among files in current tag table.
Non-nil argument (prefix arg, if interactive)
initializes to the beginning of the list of files in the tag table.Ftags-apropos
Display list of all tags in tag table REGEXP matches.Ftags-loop-continue
Continue last \[tags-search] or \[tags-query-replace] command.
Used noninteractively with non-nil argument
to begin such a command.  See variable tags-loop-form.Ftag-table-files
Return a list of files in the current tag table.
File names returned are absolute.Ftags-query-replace
Query-replace-regexp FROM with TO through all files listed in tag table.
Third arg DELIMITED (prefix arg) means replace only word-delimited matches.
If you exit (C-G or ESC), you can resume the query-replace
with the command \[tags-loop-continue].

See documentation of variable tags-file-name.Ftags-search
Search through all files listed in tag table for match for REGEXP.
Stops when a match is found.
To continue searching for next match, use command \[tags-loop-continue].

See documentation of variable tags-file-name.Fvisit-tags-table
Tell tags commands to use tag table file FILE.
FILE should be the name of a file created with the `etags' program.
A directory name is ok too; it means file TAGS in that directory.Ftelnet
Open a network login connection to host named HOST (a string).
Communication with HOST is recorded in a buffer *HOST-telnet*.
Normally input is edited in Emacs and sent a line at a time.Fterminal-emulator
Under a display-terminal emulator in BUFFER, run PROGRAM on arguments ARGS.
ARGS is a list of argument-strings.  Remaining arguments are WIDTH and HEIGHT.
BUFFER's contents are made an image of the display generated by that program,
and any input typed when BUFFER is the current Emacs buffer is sent to that
program an keyboard input.

Interactively, BUFFER defaults to "*terminal*" and PROGRAM and ARGS
are parsed from an input-string using your usual shell.
WIDTH and HEIGHT are determined from the size of the current window
-- WIDTH will be one less than the window's width, HEIGHT will be its height.

To switch buffers and leave the emulator, or to give commands
to the emulator itself (as opposed to the program running under it),
type Control-^.  The following character is an emulator command.
Type Control-^ twice to send it to the subprogram.
This escape character may be changed using the variable `terminal-escape-char'.

`Meta' characters may not currently be sent through the terminal emulator.

Here is a list of some of the variables which control the behaviour
of the emulator -- see their documentation for more information:
terminal-escape-char, terminal-scrolling, terminal-more-processing,
terminal-redisplay-interval.

This function calls the value of terminal-mode-hook if that exists
and is non-nil after the terminal buffer has been set up and the
subprocess started.

Presently with `termcap' only; if somebody sends us code to make this
work with `terminfo' we will try to use it.Flatex-mode
Major mode for editing files of input for LaTeX.
Makes $ and } display the characters they match.
Makes " insert `` when it seems to be the beginning of a quotation,
and '' when it appears to be the end; it inserts " only after a \.

Use \[TeX-region] to run LaTeX on the current region, plus the preamble
copied from the top of the file (containing \documentstyle, etc.),
running LaTeX under a special subshell.  \[TeX-buffer] does the whole buffer.
\[TeX-print] prints the .dvi file made by either of these.

Use \[validate-TeX-buffer] to check buffer for paragraphs containing
mismatched $'s or braces.

Special commands:
\{TeX-mode-map}

Mode variables:
TeX-directory
	Directory in which to create temporary files for TeX jobs
	run by \[TeX-region] or \[TeX-buffer].
TeX-dvi-print-command
	Command string used by \[TeX-print] to print a .dvi file.
TeX-show-queue-command
	Command string used by \[TeX-show-print-queue] to show the print
	queue that \[TeX-print] put your job on.

Entering LaTeX mode calls the value of text-mode-hook,
then the value of TeX-mode-hook, and then the value
of LaTeX-mode-hook.Fplain-tex-mode
Major mode for editing files of input for plain TeX.
Makes $ and } display the characters they match.
Makes " insert `` when it seems to be the beginning of a quotation,
and '' when it appears to be the end; it inserts " only after a \.

Use \[TeX-region] to run TeX on the current region, plus a "header"
copied from the top of the file (containing macro definitions, etc.),
running TeX under a special subshell.  \[TeX-buffer] does the whole buffer.
\[TeX-print] prints the .dvi file made by either of these.

Use \[validate-TeX-buffer] to check buffer for paragraphs containing
mismatched $'s or braces.

Special commands:
\{TeX-mode-map}

Mode variables:
TeX-directory
	Directory in which to create temporary files for TeX jobs
	run by \[TeX-region] or \[TeX-buffer].
TeX-dvi-print-command
	Command string used by \[TeX-print] to print a .dvi file.
TeX-show-queue-command
	Command string used by \[TeX-show-print-queue] to show the print
	queue that \[TeX-print] put your job on.

Entering plain-TeX mode calls the value of text-mode-hook,
then the value of TeX-mode-hook, and then the value
of plain-TeX-mode-hook.Ftex-mode
Major mode for editing files of input for TeX or LaTeX.
Trys to intuit whether this file is for plain TeX or LaTeX and
calls plain-tex-mode or latex-mode.  If it cannot be determined
(e.g., there are no commands in the file), the value of
TeX-default-mode is used.Ftexinfo-mode
Major mode for editing texinfo files.
These are files that are input for TEX and also to be turned
into Info files by \[texinfo-format-buffer].
These files must be written in a very restricted and
modified version of TEX input format.

As for editing commands, like text-mode except for syntax table,
which is set up so expression commands skip texinfo bracket groups.Ftexinfo-format-buffer
Process the current buffer as texinfo code, into an Info file.
The Info file output is generated in a buffer
visiting the Info file names specified in the @setfilename command.

Non-nil argument (prefix, if interactive) means don't make tag table
and don't split the file if large.  You can use Info-tagify and
Info-split to do these manually.Ftexinfo-format-region
Convert the the current region of the Texinfo file to Info format.
This lets you see what that part of the file will look like in Info.
The command is bound to \[texinfo-format-region].  The text that is
converted to Info is stored in a temporary buffer.Fbatch-texinfo-format
Runs  texinfo-format-buffer  on the files remaining on the command line.
Must be used only with -batch, and kills emacs on completion.
Each file will be processed even if an error occurred previously.
For example, invoke
  "emacs -batch -funcall batch-texinfo-format $docs/ ~/*.texinfo".Fdisplay-time
Display current time and load level in mode line of each buffer.
Updates automatically every minute.
If display-time-day-and-date is non-nil, the current day and date
are displayed as well.Funderline-region

Works by overstriking underscores.
Called from program, takes two arguments START and END
which specify the range to operate on.Fununderline-region
Remove all underlining (overstruck underscores) in the region.
Called from program, takes two arguments START and END
which specify the range to operate on.Fask-user-about-lock
Ask user what to do when he wants to edit FILE but it is locked by USER.
This function has a choice of three things to do:
  do (signal 'buffer-file-locked (list FILE USER))
    to refrain from editing the file
  return t (grab the lock on the file)
  return nil (edit the file even though it is locked).
You can rewrite it to use any criterion you like to choose which one to do.Fask-user-about-supersession-threat
Ask a user who is about to modify an obsolete buffer what to do.
This function has two choices: it can return, in which case the modification
of the buffer will proceed, or it can (signal 'file-supersession (file)),
in which case the proposed buffer modification will not be made.
You can rewrite this to use any criterion you like to choose which one to do.Fvi-mode
Major mode that acts like the `vi' editor.
The purpose of this mode is to provide you the combined power of vi (namely,
the "cross product" effect of commands and repeat last changes) and Emacs.

This command redefines nearly all keys to look like vi commands.
It records the previous major mode, and any vi command for input
(`i', `a', `s', etc.) switches back to that mode.
Thus, ordinary Emacs (in whatever major mode you had been using)
is "input" mode as far as vi is concerned.

To get back into vi from "input" mode, you must issue this command again.
Therefore, it is recommended that you assign it to a key.

Major differences between this mode and real vi :

* Limitations and unsupported features
  - Search patterns with line offset (e.g. /pat/+3 or /pat/z.) are
    not supported.
  - Ex commands are not implemented; try ':' to get some hints.
  - No line undo (i.e. the 'U' command), but multi-undo is a standard feature.

* Modifications
  - The stopping positions for some point motion commands (word boundary,
    pattern search) are slightly different from standard 'vi'.
    Also, no automatic wrap around at end of buffer for pattern searching.
  - Since changes are done in two steps (deletion then insertion), you need
    to undo twice to completely undo a change command.  But this is not needed
    for undoing a repeated change command.
  - No need to set/unset 'magic', to search for a string with regular expr
    in it just put a prefix arg for the search commands.  Replace cmds too.
  - ^R is bound to incremental backward search, so use ^L to redraw screen.

* Extensions
  - Some standard (or modified) Emacs commands were integrated, such as
    incremental search, query replace, transpose objects, and keyboard macros.
  - In command state, ^X links to the 'ctl-x-map', and ESC can be linked to
    esc-map or set undefined.  These can give you the full power of Emacs.
  - See vi-com-map for those keys that are extensions to standard vi, e.g.
    `vi-name-last-change-or-macro', `vi-verify-spelling', `vi-locate-def',
    `vi-mark-region', and 'vi-quote-words'.  Some of them are quite handy.
  - Use \[vi-switch-mode] to switch among different modes quickly.
  
Syntax table and abbrevs while in vi mode remain as they were in Emacs.Fview-file
View FILE in View mode, returning to previous buffer when done.
The usual Emacs commands are not available; instead,
a special set of commands (mostly letters and punctuation)
are defined for moving around in the buffer.
Space scrolls forward, Delete scrolls backward.
For list of all View commands, type ? or h while viewing.

Calls the value of  view-hook  if that is non-nil.Fview-buffer
View BUFFER in View mode, returning to previous buffer when done.
The usual Emacs commands are not available; instead,
a special set of commands (mostly letters and punctuation)
are defined for moving around in the buffer.
Space scrolls forward, Delete scrolls backward.
For list of all View commands, type ? or h while viewing.

Calls the value of  view-hook  if that is non-nil.Fview-mode
Major mode for viewing text but not editing it.
Letters do not insert themselves.  Instead these commands are provided.
Most commands take prefix arguments.  Commands dealing with lines
default to "scroll size" lines (initially size of window).
Search commands default to a repeat count of one.
M-< or <	move to beginning of buffer.
M-> or >	move to end of buffer.
C-v or Space	scroll forward lines.
M-v or DEL	scroll backward lines.
CR or LF	scroll forward one line (backward with prefix argument).
z		like Space except set number of lines for further
		   scrolling commands to scroll by.
C-u and Digits	provide prefix arguments.  `-' denotes negative argument.
=		prints the current line number.
g		goes to line given by prefix argument.
/ or M-C-s	searches forward for regular expression
\ or M-C-r	searches backward for regular expression.
n		searches forward for last regular expression.
p		searches backward for last regular expression.
C-@ or .	set the mark.
x		exchanges point and mark.
C-s or s	do forward incremental search.
C-r or r	do reverse incremental search.
@ or '		return to mark and pops mark ring.
		  Mark ring is pushed at start of every
		  successful search and when jump to line to occurs.
		  The mark is set on jump to buffer start or end.
? or h		provide help message (list of commands).
C-h		provides help (list of commands or description of a command).
C-n		moves down lines vertically.
C-p		moves upward lines vertically.
C-l		recenters the screen.
q or C-c	exit view-mode and return to previous buffer.

Entry to this mode calls the value of  view-hook  if non-nil.
\{view-mode-map}Fvip-mode
Begin emulating the vi editor.  This is distinct from `vi-mode'.
This emulator has different capabilities from the `vi-mode' emulator.

Other control and meta characters terminate the search
 and are then executed normally.
The above special characters are mostly controlled by parameters;
 do M-x apropos on search-.*-char to find them.
C-g while searching or when search has failed
 cancels input back to what has been found successfully.
C-g when search is successful aborts and moves point to starting point.Fisearch-forward-regexp

only symbols with function definitions are considered.
Otherwise, all symbols with function definitions, values
or properties are considered.Fforward-page
Move forward to page boundary.  With arg, repeat, or go back if negative.
