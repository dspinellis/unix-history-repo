.TH EMACSTOOL 1
.SH NAME
.I emacstool 
\- run emacs under Sun windows with function-key and mouse support.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.I emacstool
[{window_args} {-rc run_command_path} args ... ]
.SH TYPICAL USAGE
In ~/.suntools or ~/.rootmenu include a line like this:
.br
"Emacstool"     emacstool -WI emacs.icon -f emacstool-init
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B  Emacstool
creates a SunView frame and a tty subwindow within which mouse events
and function keys are translated to ASCII sequences which Emacs can
parse.  The translated input events are sent to the process running in
the tty subwindow, which is typically GNU Emacs.  Emacstool thereby
allows GNU Emacs users to make full use of the mouse and function keys.
GNU Emacs can be loaded with functions to interpret the mouse and
function-key events to make a truely fine screen oriented editor for
the Sun Workstation.
.PP
(Note that GNU Emacs has a special interface to the X window system as
well.  The X window system has many technical advantages, it is an
industry standard, and it is also free software.  The Free Software
Foundation urges you to try X windows, and distributes a free copy of
X on Emacs distribution tapes.)
.PP
Function keys are translated to a sequence of the form
`^X*[a-o][lrt]'.  The last character is `l', `r', or `t' corresponding
to whether the key is among the Left, Right, or Top function keys.
The third character indicates which button of the group
was pressed.  Thus, the function key in the lower right corner will
transmit the sequence `^X*or'.  In addition, the [lrt] is affected by
the Control, Meta, and Shift keys.  Unshifted Control keys will be
non-alphabetic: C-l is [,], C-r is [2], C-t is [4].
.PP 
Mouse buttons are encoded as `^X^@([124] x y)\\n'.  ^X^@ is the
standard GNU Emacs mouse event prefix, it is followed by a list
indicating the button pressed and the character row and column of the
point in the window where the mouse cursor is, and followed by a
newline character.  In GNU Emacs, the ^X^@ dispatches to a
mouse event handler which then reads the following list.
.SH OPTIONS
.B Emacstool
supports all the standard window arguments, including font and icon 
specifiers.  
.PP
By default, Emacstool runs the program 
.I emacs
in the created subwindow.  
The value of the environment variable 
.I EMACSTOOL
can be used to override this if your version of 
.B Emacs
is not accessible on your search path by the name 
.I Emacs.
In addition, the run command can be set by the 
.I pathname 
following the last occurence of the
.I \-rc
flag.
This is convenient for using Emacstool to run on remote machines.
.PP
All other command line arguments not used by the window system are passed
as arguments to the program that runs in the Emacstool window.
.PP
For example: 
.PP
local% (emacstool -rc rlogin remote -8 &)&
.PP
will create an Emacstool window logged in to a machine named
.I remote.
If Emacs is run from this window, 
Emacstool will encode mouse and function keys, and send them to rlogin.
If Emacs is run from this shell on the remote machine, it will see
the mouse and function keys properly.
However, since the remote host does not have access to the screen,
the cursor cannot be changed, menus will not appear, and the selection
buffer (STUFF) is limited.
.SH Using With GNU Emacs:
The GNU Emacs files
lisp/term/sun.el,
lisp/sun-mouse.el, 
lisp/sun-fns.el, 
and 
src/sunfns.c
provide emacs support for the Emacstool and function keys.
Emacstool will automatically set the TERM environment variable to be "sun"
and unset the environment variable TERMCAP.  That is, these variables will
not be inherited from the shell that starts Emacstool.
Since the terminal type is
.I SUN
(that is, the environment variable TERM is set to 
.I SUN), 
Emacs will automatically load the file lisp/term/sun.
This, in turn, will ensure that sun-mouse.el is autoloaded when any mouse
events are detected.  It is suggested that 
.I sun-mouse 
and
.I sun-fns
be loaded in your site-init.el file, so that they will always be loaded
when running on a Sun workstation.
.PP
In addition, Emacstool sets the environment variable IN_EMACSTOOL = "t".
Lisp code in your ~/.emacs can use (getenv "IN_EMACSTOOL")
to determine whether to do Emacstool specific initalization.
Sun.el uses this to automatically call emacstool-init (getenv "IN_EMACSTOOL")
is defined.
.PP
The file src/sunfns.c defines several useful functions for emacs on
the Sun.  Among these are procedures to pop-up SunView 
.I menus, 
put and get from the SunView
.I STUFF
buffer, and a procedure for changing the cursor 
.I icon.
If you want to define or edit cursor icons, 
there is a rudimentary mouse driven icon editor in the file
lisp/sun-cursors.el.  Try invoking (sc:edit-cursor)
.SH BUGS
It takes a few milliseconds to create a menu before it pops up.
