Glossary
********

Abbrev     
     An abbrev is a text string which expands into a different text string
     when present in the buffer.  For example, you might define a short
     word as an abbrev for a long phrase that you want to insert
     frequently.  *Note Abbrevs::.
     
Aborting     
     Aborting means getting out of a recursive edit (q.v.).  The
     commands `C-]' and `M-x top-level' are used for this.
     *Note Quitting::.
     
Auto Fill mode     
     Auto Fill mode is a minor mode in which text that you insert is
     automatically broken into lines of fixed width.  *Note Filling::.
     
Auto Saving     
     Auto saving is when Emacs automatically stores the contents of an
     Emacs buffer in a specially-named file so that the information will
     not be lost if the buffer is lost due to a system error or user error.
     *Note Auto Save::.
     
Backup File     
     A backup file records the contents that a file had before the current
     editing session.  Emacs makes backup files automatically to help you
     track down or cancel changes you later regret making.  *Note Backup::.
     
Balance Parentheses     
     Emacs can balance parentheses manually or automatically.  Manual
     balancing is done by the commands to move over balanced expressions
     (*Note Lists::).  Automatic balancing is done by blinking the
     parenthesis that matches one just inserted (*Note Matching Parens: Matching.).
     
Bind     
     To bind a key is to change its binding (q.v.).  *Note Rebinding::.
     
Binding     
     A key gets its meaning in Emacs by having a binding which is a
     command (q.v.), a Lisp function that is run when the key is typed.
     *Note Binding: Commands.  Customization often involves rebinding a
     character to a different command function.  The bindings of all keys
     are recorded in the keymaps (q.v.).  *Note Keymaps::.
     
Blank Lines     
     Blank lines are lines that contain only whitespace.  Emacs has several
     commands for operating on the blank lines in the buffer.
     
Buffer     
     The buffer is the basic editing unit; one buffer corresponds to one
     piece of text being edited.  You can have several buffers, but at any
     time you are editing only one, the `selected' buffer, though several
     can be visible when you are using multiple windows.  *Note Buffers::.
     
Buffer Selection History     
     Emacs keeps a buffer selection history which records how recently each
     Emacs buffer has been selected.  This is used for choosing a buffer to
     select.  *Note Buffers::.
     
C-     
     `C' in the name of a character is an abbreviation for Control.
     *Note C-: Characters.
     
C-M-     
     `C-M-' in the name of a character is an abbreviation for
     Control-Meta.  *Note C-M-: Characters.
     
Case Conversion     
     Case conversion means changing text from upper case to lower case or
     vice versa.  *Note Case::, for the commands for case conversion.
     
Characters     
     Characters form the contents of an Emacs buffer; also, Emacs commands
     are invoked by keys (q.v.), which are sequences of one or more
     characters.  *Note Characters::.
     
Command     
     A command is a Lisp function specially defined to be able to serve as
     a key binding in Emacs.  When you type a key (q.v.), its binding
     (q.v.) is looked up in the relevant keymaps (q.v.) to find the
     command to run.  *Note Commands::.
     
Command Name     
     A command name is the name of a Lisp symbol which is a command
     (*Note Commands::).  You can invoke any command by its name using
     `M-x' (*Note M-x::).
     
Comments     
     A comment is text in a program which is intended only for humans
     reading the program, and is marked specially so that it will be
     ignored when the program is loaded or compiled.  Emacs offers special
     commands for creating, aligning and killing comments.
     *Note Comments::.
     
Compilation     
     Compilation is the process of creating an executable program from
     source code.  Emacs has commands for compiling files of Emacs Lisp
     code (*Note Lisp Libraries::) and programs in C and other languages
     (*Note Compilation::).
     
Complete Key     
     A complete key is a character or sequence of characters which, when typed
     by the user, fully specifies one action to be performed by Emacs.  For
     example, `X' and `Control-f' and `Control-x m' are keys.  Keys
     derive their meanings from being bound (q.v.) to commands (q.v.).
     Thus, `X' is conventionally bound to a command to insert `X' in
     the buffer; `C-x m' is conventionally bound to a command to begin
     composing a mail message. *Note Keys::.
     
Completion     
     Completion is what Emacs does when it automatically fills out an
     abbreviation for a name into the entire name.  Completion is done for
     minibuffer (q.v.) arguments when the set of possible valid inputs is
     known; for example, on command names, buffer names, and file names.
     Completion occurs when TAB, SPC or RET is typed.  *Note Completion::.
     
Continuation Line     
     When a line of text is longer than the width of the screen, it
     takes up more than one screen line when displayed.  We say that the
     text line is continued, and all screen lines used for it after the
     first are called continuation lines.  *Note Continuation: Basic.
     
Control-Character     
     ASCII characters with octal codes 0 through 037, and also code 0177,
     do not have graphic images assigned to them.  These are the control
     characters.  Any control character can be typed by holding down the
     CTRL key and typing some other character; some have special keys on
     the keyboard.  RET, TAB, ESC, LFD and DEL are all control characters.
     *Note Characters::.
     
Copyleft     
     A copyleft is a notice giving the public legal permission to redistribute
     a program or other work of art.  Copylefts are used by leftists to enrich
     the public just as copyrights are used by rightists to gain power over
     the public.
     
Current Buffer     
     The current buffer in Emacs is the Emacs buffer on which most editing
     commands operate.  You can select any Emacs buffer as the current one.
     *Note Buffers::.
     
Current Line     
     The line point is on (*Note Point::).
     
Current Paragraph     
     The paragraph that point is in.  If point is between paragraphs, the
     current paragraph is the one that follows point.  *Note Paragraphs::.
     
Current Defun     
     The defun (q.v.) that point is in.  If point is between defuns, the
     current defun is the one that follows point.  *Note Defuns::.
     
Cursor     
     The cursor is the rectangle on the screen which indicates the position
     called point (q.v.) at which insertion and deletion takes place.
     The cursor is on or under the character that follows point.  Often
     people speak of `the cursor' when, strictly speaking, they mean
     `point'.  *Note Cursor: Basic.
     
Customization     
     Customization is making minor changes in the way Emacs works.  It is
     often done by setting variables (*Note Variables::) or by rebinding
     keys (*Note Keymaps::).
     
Default Argument     
     The default for an argument is the value that will be assumed if you
     do not specify one.  When the minibuffer is used to read an argument,
     the default argument is used if you just type RET.
     *Note Minibuffer::.
     
Default Directory     
     When you specify a file name that does not start with `/' or `~',
     it is interpreted relative to the current buffer's default directory.
     *Note Default Directory: Minibuffer File.
     
Defun     
     A defun is a list at the top level of parenthesis or bracket structure
     in a program.  It is so named because most such lists in Lisp programs
     are calls to the Lisp function `defun'.  *Note Defuns::.
     
DEL     
     DEL is a character that runs the command to delete one character of
     text.  *Note DEL: Basic.
     
Deletion     
     Deletion means erasing text without saving it.  Emacs deletes text
     only when it is expected not to be worth saving (all whitespace, or
     only one character).  The alternative is killing (q.v.).
     *Note Deletion: Killing.
     
Deletion of Files     
     Deleting a file means erasing it from the file system.
     *Note Misc File Ops::.
     
Deletion of Messages     
     Deleting a message means flagging it to be eliminated from your mail
     file.  This can be undone by undeletion until the mail file is expunged.
     *Note Rmail Deletion::.
     
Deletion of Windows     
     Deleting a window means eliminating it from the screen.  Other windows
     expand to use up the space.  The deleted window can never come back,
     but no actual text is thereby lost.  *Note Windows::.
     
Directory     
     Files in the Unix file system are grouped into file directories.
     *Note Directories: ListDir.
     
Dired     
     Dired is the Emacs facility that displays the contents of a file
     directory and allows you to "edit the directory", performing
     operations on the files in the directory.  *Note Dired::.
     
Disabled Command     
     A disabled command is one that you may not run without special
     confirmation.  The usual reason for disabling a command is that it is
     confusing for beginning users.  *Note Disabling::.
     
Dribble File     
     A file into which Emacs writes all the characters that the user types
     on the keyboard.  Dribble files are used to make a record for
     debugging Emacs bugs.  Emacs does not make a dribble file unless you
     tell it to.  *Note Bugs::.
     
Echo Area     
     The echo area is the bottom line of the screen, used for echoing the
     arguments to commands, for asking questions, and printing brief
     messages (including error messages).  *Note Echo Area::.
     
Echoing     
     Echoing is acknowledging the receipt of commands by displaying them
     (in the echo area).  Emacs never echoes single-character keys; longer
     keys echo only if you pause while typing them.
     
Error     
     An error occurs when an Emacs command cannot execute in the current
     circumstances.  When an error occurs, execution of the command stops
     (unless the command has been programmed to do otherwise) and Emacs
     reports the error by printing an error message (q.v.).  Type-ahead
     is discarded.  Then Emacs is ready to read another editing command.
     
Error Messages     
     Error messages are single lines of output printed by Emacs when the
     user asks for something impossible to do (such as, killing text
     forward when point is at the end of the buffer).  They appear in the
     echo area, accompanied by a beep.
     
ESC     
     ESC is a character, used to end incremental searches and as a
     prefix for typing Meta characters on keyboards lacking a META
     key.  Unlike the META key (which, like the SHIFT key, is held
     down while another character is typed), the ESC key is pressed
     once and applies to the next character typed.
     
Fill Prefix     
     The fill prefix is a string that should be expected at the beginning
     of each line when filling is done.  It is not regarded as part of the
     text to be filled.  *Note Filling::.
     
Filling     
     Filling text means moving text from line to line so that all the lines
     are approximately the same length.  *Note Filling::.
     
Global     
     Global means `independent of the current environment; in effect
     throughout Emacs'.  It is the opposite of local (q.v.).  Particular
     examples of the use of `global' appear below.
     
Global Abbrev     
     A global definition of an abbrev (q.v.) is effective in all major
     modes that do not have local (q.v.) definitions for the same abbrev.
     *Note Abbrevs::.
     
Global Keymap     
     The global keymap (q.v.) contains key bindings that are in effect
     except when overridden by local key bindings in a major mode's local
     keymap (q.v.).  *Note Keymaps::.
     
Global Substitution     
     Global substitution means replacing each occurrence of one string by
     another string through a large amount of text.  *Note Replace::.
     
Global Variable     
     The global value of a variable (q.v.) takes effect in all buffers
     that do not have their own local (q.v.) values for the variable.
     *Note Variables::.
     
Graphic Character     
     Graphic characters are those assigned pictorial images rather than
     just names.  All the non-Meta (q.v.) characters except for the
     Control (q.v.) characters are graphic characters.  These include
     letters, digits, punctuation, and spaces; they do not include
     RET or ESC.  In Emacs, typing a graphic character inserts
     that character (in ordinary editing modes).  *Note Basic Editing: Basic.
     
Grinding     
     Grinding means adjusting the indentation in a program to fit the
     nesting structure.  *Note Grinding: Indentation.
     
Hardcopy     
     Hardcopy means printed output.  Emacs has commands for making printed
     listings of text in Emacs buffers.  *Note Hardcopy::.
     
HELP     
     You can type HELP at any time to ask what options you have, or
     to ask what any command does.  HELP is really `Control-h'.
     *Note Help::.
     
Inbox     
     An inbox is a file in which mail is delivered by the operating system.
     Rmail transfers mail from inboxes to mail files (q.v.) in which the
     mail is then stored permanently or until explicitly deleted.
     *Note Rmail Inbox::.
     
Indentation     
     Indentation means blank space at the beginning of a line.  Most
     programming languages have conventions for using indentation to
     illuminate the structure of the program, and Emacs has special
     features to help you set up the correct indentation.
     *Note Indentation::.
     
Insertion     
     Insertion means copying text into the buffer, either from the keyboard
     or from some other place in Emacs.
     
Justification     
     Justification means adding extra spaces to lines of text to make them
     come exactly to a specified width.  *Note Justification: Filling.
     
Keyboard Macros     
     Keyboard macros are a way of defining new Emacs commands from
     sequences of existing ones, with no need to write a Lisp program.
     *Note Keyboard Macros::.
     
Key     
     A key is a sequence of characters that, when input to Emacs, specify
     or begin to specify a single action for Emacs to perform.  That is,
     the sequence is not more than a single unit.  If the key is enough to
     specify one action, it is a complete key (q.v.); if it is less than
     enough, it is a prefix key (q.v.).  *Note Keys::.
     
Keymap     
     The keymap is the data structure that records the bindings (q.v.) of
     keys to the commands that they run.  For example, the keymap binds the
     character `C-n' to the command function `next-line'.
     *Note Keymaps::.
     
Kill Ring     
     The kill ring is where all text you have killed recently is saved.
     You can reinsert any of the killed text still in the ring; this is
     called yanking (q.v.).  *Note Yanking::.
     
Killing     
     Killing means erasing text and saving it on the kill ring so it can be
     yanked (q.v.) later.  Some other systems call this "cutting".
     Most Emacs commands to erase text do killing, as opposed to deletion
     (q.v.).  *Note Killing::.
     
Killing Jobs     
     Killing a job (such as, an invocation of Emacs) means making it cease
     to exist.  Any data within it, if not saved in a file, is lost.
     *Note Exiting::.
     
List     
     A list is, approximately, a text string beginning with an open
     parenthesis and ending with the matching close parenthesis.  In C mode
     and other non-Lisp modes, groupings surrounded by other kinds of matched
     delimiters appropriate to the language, such as braces, are also
     considered lists.  Emacs has special commands for many operations on
     lists.  *Note Lists::.
     
Local     
     Local means `in effect only in a particular context'; the relevant
     kind of context is a particular function execution, a particular
     buffer, or a particular major mode.  It is the opposite of `global'
     (q.v.).  Specific uses of `local' in Emacs terminology appear below.
     
Local Abbrev     
     A local abbrev definition is effective only if a particular major mode
     is selected.  In that major mode, it overrides any global definition
     for the same abbrev.  *Note Abbrevs::.
     
Local Keymap     
     A local keymap is used in a particular major mode; the key bindings
     (q.v.) in the current local keymap override global bindings of the
     same keys.  *Note Keymaps::.
     
Local Variable     
     A local value of a variable (q.v.) applies to only one buffer.
     *Note Locals::.
     
M-     
     `M-' in the name of a character is an abbreviation for META,
     one of the modifier keys that can accompany any character.
     *Note Characters::.
     
M-C-     
     `M-C-' in the name of a character is an abbreviation for
     Control-Meta; it means the same thing as `C-M-'.  If your
     terminal lacks a real META key, you type a Control-Meta character by
     typing ESC and then typing the corresponding Control character.
     *Note C-M-: Characters.
     
M-x     
     `M-x' is the key which is used to call an Emacs command by name.
     This is how commands that are not bound to keys are called.
     *Note M-x::.
     
Mail     
     Mail means messages sent from one user to another through the computer
     system, to be read at the recipient's convenience.  Emacs has commands for
     composing and sending mail, and for reading and editing the mail you have
     received.  *Note Sending Mail::.  *Note Rmail::, for how to read mail.
     
Mail File     
     A mail file is a file which is edited using Rmail and in which Rmail
     stores mail.  *Note Rmail::.
     
Major Mode     
     The major modes are a mutually exclusive set of options each of which
     configures Emacs for editing a certain sort of text.  Ideally, each
     programming language has its own major mode.  *Note Major Modes::.
     
Mark     
     The mark points to a position in the text.  It specifies one end of
     the region (q.v.), point being the other end.  Many commands operate
     on all the text from point to the mark.  *Note Mark::.
     
Mark Ring     
     The mark ring is used to hold several recent previous locations of the
     mark, just in case you want to move back to them.  *Note Mark Ring::.
     
Message     
     See `mail'.
     
Meta     
     Meta is the name of a modifier bit which a command character may have.
     It is present in a character if the character is typed with the
     META key held down.  Such characters are given names that start
     with `Meta-'.  For example, `Meta-<' is typed by holding down
     META and at the same time typing `<' (which itself is done,
     on most terminals, by holding down SHIFT and typing `,').
     *Note Meta: Characters.
     
Meta Character     
     A Meta character is one whose character code includes the Meta bit.
     
Minibuffer     
     The minibuffer is the window that appears when necessary inside the
     echo area (q.v.), used for reading arguments to commands.
     *Note Minibuffer::.
     
Minor Mode     
     A minor mode is an optional feature of Emacs which can be switched on
     or off independently of all other features.  Each minor mode has a
     command to turn it on or off.  *Note Minor Modes::.
     
Mode Line     
     The mode line is the line at the bottom of each text window (q.v.),
     which gives status information on the buffer displayed in that window.
     *Note Mode Line::.
     
Modified Buffer     
     A buffer (q.v.) is modified if its text has been changed since the
     last time the buffer was saved (or since when it was created, if it
     has never been saved).  *Note Saving::.
     
Moving Text     
     Moving text means erasing it from one place and inserting it in
     another.  This is done by killing (q.v.) and then yanking (q.v.).
     *Note Killing::.
     
Named Mark     
     A named mark is a register (q.v.) in its role of recording a
     location in text so that you can move point to that location.
     *Note Registers::.
     
Narrowing     
     Narrowing means creating a restriction (q.v.) that limits editing in
     the current buffer to only a part of the text in the buffer.  Text
     outside that part is inaccessible to the user until the boundaries are
     widened again, but it is still there, and saving the file saves it
     all.  *Note Narrowing::.
     
Newline     
     LFD characters in the buffer terminate lines of text and are
     called newlines.  *Note Newline: Characters.
     
Numeric Argument     
     A numeric argument is a number, specified before a command, to change
     the effect of the command.  Often the numeric argument serves as a
     repeat count.  *Note Arguments::.
     
Option     
     An option is a variable (q.v.) that exists so that you can customize
     Emacs by giving it a new value.  *Note Variables::.
     
Overwrite Mode     
     Overwrite mode is a minor mode.  When it is enabled, ordinary text
     characters replace the existing text after point rather than pushing
     it to the right.  *Note Minor Modes::.
     
Page     
     A page is a unit of text, delimited by formfeed characters (ASCII
     Control-L, code 014) coming at the beginning of a line.  Some Emacs
     commands are provided for moving over and operating on pages.
     *Note Pages::.
     
Paragraphs     
     Paragraphs are the medium-size unit of English text.  There are
     special Emacs commands for moving over and operating on paragraphs.
     *Note Paragraphs::.
     
Parsing     
     We say that Emacs parses words or expressions in the text being
     edited.  Really, all it knows how to do is find the other end of a
     word or expression.  *Note Syntax::.
     
Point     
     Point is the place in the buffer at which insertion and deletion
     occur.  Point is considered to be between two characters, not at one
     character.  The terminal's cursor (q.v.) indicates the location of
     point.  *Note Point: Basic.
     
Prefix Key     
     A prefix key is a key (q.v.) whose sole function is to introduce a
     set of multi-character keys.  `Control-x' is an example of prefix
     key; thus, any two-character sequence starting with `C-x' is also
     a legitimate key.  *Note Keys::.
     
Primary Mail File     
     Your primary mail file is the file named `RMAIL' in your home
     directory, where all mail that you receive is stored by Rmail unless you
     make arrangements to do otherwise.  *Note Rmail::.
     
Prompt     
     A prompt is text printed to ask the user for input.  Printing a prompt
     is called prompting.  Emacs prompts always appear in the echo area
     (q.v.).  One kind of prompting happens when the minibuffer is used
     to read an argument (*Note Minibuffer::); the echoing which happens
     when you pause in the middle of typing a multicharacter key is also a
     kind of prompting (*Note Echo Area::).
     
Quitting     
     Quitting means cancelling a partially typed command or a running
     command, using `C-g'.  *Note Quitting::.
     
Quoting     
     Quoting means depriving a character of its usual special significance.
     In Emacs this is usually done with `Control-q'.  What constitutes special
     significance depends on the context and on convention.  For example,
     an "ordinary" character as an Emacs command inserts itself; so in
     this context, a special character is any character that does not
     normally insert itself (such as DEL, for example), and quoting
     it makes it insert itself as if it were not special.  Not all contexts
     allow quoting.  *Note Quoting: Basic.
     
Read-only Buffer     
     A read-only buffer is one whose text you are not allowed to change.
     Normally Emacs makes buffers read-only when they contain text which
     has a special significance to Emacs; for example, Dired buffers.
     Visiting a file that is write protected also makes a read-only buffer.
     *Note Buffers::.
     
Recursive Editing Level     
     A recursive editing level is a state in which part of the execution of
     a command involves asking the user to edit some text.  This text may
     or may not be the same as the text to which the command was applied.
     The mode line indicates recursive editing levels with square brackets
     (`[' and `]').  *Note Recursive Edit::.
     
Redisplay     
     Redisplay is the process of correcting the image on the screen to
     correspond to changes that have been made in the text being edited.
     *Note Redisplay: Screen.
     
Regexp     
     See `regular expression'.
     
Region     
     The region is the text between point (q.v.) and the mark (q.v.).
     Many commands operate on the text of the region.  *Note Region: Mark.
     
Registers     
     Registers are named slots in which text or buffer positions or
     rectangles can be saved for later use.  *Note Registers::.
     
Regular Expression     
     A regular expression is a pattern that can match various text strings;
     for example, `l[0-9]+' matches `l' followed by one or more
     digits.  *Note Regexps::.
     
Replacement     
     See `global substitution'.
     
Restriction     
     A buffer's restriction is the amount of text, at the beginning or the
     end of the buffer, that is temporarily invisible and inaccessible.
     Giving a buffer a nonzero amount of restriction is called narrowing
     (q.v.).  *Note Narrowing::.
     
RET     
     RET is a character than in Emacs runs the command to insert a
     newline into the text.  It is also used to terminate most arguments
     read in the minibuffer (q.v.).  *Note Return: Characters.
     
Saving     
     Saving a buffer means copying its text into the file that was visited
     (q.v.) in that buffer.  This is the way text in files actually gets
     changed by your Emacs editing.  *Note Saving::.
     
Scrolling     
     Scrolling means shifting the text in the Emacs window so as to see a
     different part of the buffer.  *Note Scrolling: Display.
     
Searching     
     Searching means moving point to the next occurrence of a specified
     string.  *Note Search::.
     
Selecting     
     Selecting a buffer means making it the current (q.v.) buffer.
     *Note Selecting: Buffers.
     
Self-documentation     
     Self-documentation is the feature of Emacs which can tell you what any
     command does, or give you a list of all commands related to a topic
     you specify.  You ask for self-documentation with the help character,
     `C-h'.  *Note Help::.
     
Sentences     
     Emacs has commands for moving by or killing by sentences.
     *Note Sentences::.
     
Sexp     
     A sexp (short for `s-expression') is the basic syntactic unit of Lisp
     in its textual form: either a list, or Lisp atom.  Many Emacs commands
     operate on sexps.  The term `sexp' is generalized to languages other
     than Lisp, to mean a syntactically recognizable expression.
     *Note Sexps: Lists.
     
Simultaneous Editing     
     Simultaneous editing means two users modifying the same file at once.
     Simultaneous editing if not detected can cause one user to lose his
     work.  Emacs detects all cases of simultaneous editing and warns the
     user to investigate them.  *Note Simultaneous Editing: Interlocking.
     
String     
     A string is a kind of Lisp data object which contains a sequence of
     characters.  Many Emacs variables are intended to have strings as
     values.  The Lisp syntax for a string consists of the characters in
     the string with a `"' before and another `"' after.  A
     `"' that is part of the string must be written as `\"' and a
     `\' that is part of the string must be written as `\\'.  All
     other characters, including newline, can be included just by writing
     them inside the string; however, escape sequences as in C, such as
     `\n' for newline or `\241' using an octal character code,
     are allowed as well.
     
String Substitution     
     See `global substitution'.
     
Syntax Table     
     The syntax table tells Emacs which characters are part of a word,
     which characters balance each other like parentheses, etc.
     *Note Syntax::.
     
Tag Table     
     A tag table is a file that serves as an index to the function
     definitions in one or more other files.  *Note Tags::.
     
Termscript File     
     A termscript file contains a record of all characters sent by Emacs to
     the terminal.  It is used for tracking down bugs in Emacs redisplay.
     Emacs does not make a termscript file unless you tell it to.
     *Note Bugs::.
     
Text     
     Two meanings (*Note Text::):
     
        * Data consisting of a sequence of characters, as opposed to binary
          numbers, images, graphics commands, executable programs, and the like.
          The contents of an Emacs buffer are always text in this sense.
        * Data consisting of written human language, as opposed to programs,
          or following the stylistic conventions of human language.
     
Top Level     
     Top level is the normal state of Emacs, in which you are editing the
     text of the file you have visited.  You are at top level whenever you
     are not in a recursive editing level (q.v.) or the minibuffer
     (q.v.), and not in the middle of a command.  You can get back to top
     level by aborting (q.v.) and quitting (q.v.).  *Note Quitting::.
     
Transposition     
     Transposing two units of text means putting each one into the place
     formerly occupied by the other.  There are Emacs commands to transpose
     two adjacent characters, words, sexps (q.v.) or lines
     (*Note Transpose::).
     
Truncation     
     Truncating text lines in the display means leaving out any text on a
     line that does not fit within the right margin of the window
     displaying it.  See also `continuation line'.
     *Note Truncation: Basic.
     
Undoing     
     Undoing means making your previous editing go in reverse, bringing
     back the text that existed earlier in the editing session.
     *Note Undo::.
     
Variable     
     A variable is an object in Lisp that can store an arbitrary value.
     Emacs uses some variables for internal purposes, and has others (known
     as `options' (q.v.)) just so that you can set their values to
     control the behavior of Emacs.  The variables used in Emacs that you
     are likely to be interested in are listed in the Variables Index in
     this manual.  *Note Variables::, for information on variables.
     
Visiting     
     Visiting a file means loading its contents into a buffer (q.v.)
     where they can be edited.  *Note Visiting::.
     
Whitespace     
     Whitespace is any run of consecutive formatting characters (space,
     tab, newline, and backspace).
     
Widening     
     Widening is removing any restriction (q.v.) on the current buffer;
     it is the opposite of narrowing (q.v.).  *Note Narrowing::.
     
Window     
     Emacs divides the screen into one or more windows, each of which can
     display the contents of one buffer (q.v.) at any time.
     *Note Screen::, for basic information on how Emacs uses the screen.
     *Note Windows::, for commands to control the use of windows.
     
Word Abbrev     
     Synonymous with `abbrev'.
     
Word Search     
     Word search is searching for a sequence of words, considering the
     punctuation between them as insignificant.  *Note Word Search::.
     
Yanking     
     Yanking means reinserting text previously killed.  It can be used to
     undo a mistaken kill, or for copying or moving text.  Some other
     systems call this "pasting".  *Note Yanking::.
