     The program "nntpxmit" is an active trnamission client
(see the comment in nntpxmit.c for a description of the
difference between active and passive clients) written by Erik Fair
<fair@ucbvax.berkeley.edu, ...!ucbvax!fair>.

     nntpxmit requires support from the 2.10.3 news source.
Because of this, it must be compiled in the "src" directory of
the 2.10.3 distribution.  You should:

     1. Move the *.c and *.h files to 2.10.3/src

     2. Move ../common/response_codes.h into 2.10.3/src

     3. Add the lines in the Makefile in this directory to the
	2.10.3/src Makefile.

     4. Then do "make nntpxmit".

     Having compiled nntpxmit like that, you need to set your news
system up to use it.  Nntpxmit takes as arguments an internet host
to connect to, and a file containing a list of articles to send to
it.

     So, you might edit your news sys file to have an entry like:

#
# NASA Ames Research Center
#
nike:ucb,uc,mod,to.nike:F:/usr/spool/news/batch/nike

This will place names of news articles in the ucb, uc, and mod newsgroups
in the file "/usr/spool/news/batch/nike".

Periodically, you should have crontab run nntpxmit like so:

nntpxmit ames.arpa:/usr/spool/news/batch/nike

which sends each article via NNTP with the IHAVE command
to the host "ames.arpa".  Once finished, it removes the file
/usr/spool/news/batch/nike.

     nntpxmit has an option "-s" which *supresses* statistic
logging via syslog.  Additionally, the "-d" option is availible
for debugging.
