#print
When you want to match one of a few specific characters,
and not just anything, the pattern is similar to that used in
file names. That is,
  [abc]
matches the letters 'a', 'b', or 'c', but nothing
else.  Try this sequence and note what happens:

ex lines
1,$p
1s/[123]/9/
2s/[123]/9/
1,$p
wq
ready

(Remember that you can use '%' to abbreviate '1,$p'.)
