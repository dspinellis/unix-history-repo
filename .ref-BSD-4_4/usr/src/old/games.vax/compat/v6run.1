.TH V6RUN 1 
.SH NAME
v6run, v7run  \-  compatability mode execution on VAX
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B v6run
[
.B \-root
] file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I V6run
and
.I v7run
are programs to run UNIX version 6 and UNIX version 7
.I a.out
format PDP-11 executable files.
The hardware compatability mode of the VAX is used for all PDP-11
instructions for which it applies.
System calls from the compatability mode program are caught
and simulated by executing appropriate native mode system calls.
.PP
The optional
.I root
specification indicates a directory which is to be treated as
the root directory for the process and its children.
This is especially useful for running a PDP-11 shell on
a directory hierarchy which looks like a PDP-11 file system
using a command such as
.sp
.ti +5
"v6run -/user/pdp11stuff/v6files /bin/sh".
.sp
Note that the specification of the file to execute (/bin/sh)
is relative to the specified directory.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Open failures are reported if files can not be opened for read access.
Other error messages concern bad system calls, bad a.out format etc.
.SH BUGS
There is no way to run separated I/D space processes.
The floating point simulation has not been well tested and no
doubt has some problems.
