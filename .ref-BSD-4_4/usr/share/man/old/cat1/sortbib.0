     SSoorrttbbiibb sorts files of records containing refer key-letters by user-
     specified keys.  Records may be separated by blank lines, or by `.[' and
     `.]' delimiters, but the two styles may not be mixed together.  This pro-
     gram reads through each _d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e and pulls out key fields, which are
     sorted separately.  The sorted key fields contain the file pointer, byte
     offset, and length of corresponding records.  These records are delivered
     using disk seeks and reads, so ssoorrttbbiibb may not be used in a pipeline to
     read standard input.

     Option available:

     s     By default, ssoorrttbbiibb alphabetizes by the first %A and the %D fields,
           which contain the senior author and date.  The --ss option is used to
           specify new _K_E_Y_S. For instance, --ss_A_T_D will sort by author, title,
           and date, while --ss_A_+_D will sort by all authors, and date.  Sort
           keys past the fourth are not meaningful.

     No more than 16 databases may be sorted together at one time.  Records
     longer than 4096 characters will be truncated.

     SSoorrttbbiibb sorts on the last word on the %A line, which is assumed to be the
     author's last name.  A word in the final position, such as ``jr.'' or
     ``ed.'', will be ignored if the name beforehand ends with a comma.  Au-
     thors with two-word last names or unusual constructions can be sorted
     correctly by using the nroff convention ``\0'' in place of a blank.  A %Q
     field is considered to be the same as %A, except sorting begins with the
     first, not the last, word.  SSoorrttbbiibb sorts on the last word of the %D
     line, usually the year.  It also ignores leading articles (like ``A'' or
     ``The'') when sorting by titles in the %T or %J fields; it will ignore
     articles of any modern European language.  If a sort-significant field is
     absent from a record, ssoorrttbbiibb places that record before other records
     containing that field.

     Records with missing author fields should probably be sorted by title.
