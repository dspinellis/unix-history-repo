       re_format - POSIX 1003.2 regular expressions

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Regular expressions (``RE''s), as defined in POSIX 1003.2,
       come in two forms: modern REs  (roughly  those  of  _e_g_r_e_p;
       1003.2  calls  these  ``extended''  REs)  and obsolete REs
       (roughly those of _e_d; 1003.2 ``basic'' REs).  Obsolete REs
       mostly  exist  for backward compatibility in some old pro-
       grams; they will be discussed at the end.   1003.2  leaves
       some  aspects  of  RE syntax and semantics open; `|-' marks
       decisions on these aspects that may not be fully  portable
       to other 1003.2 implementations.

       A  (modern)  RE is one|- or more non-empty|- _b_r_a_n_c_h_e_s, sepa-
       rated by `|'.  It matches anything that matches one of the
       branches.

       A branch is one|- or more _p_i_e_c_e_s, concatenated.  It matches
       a match for the first, followed by a match for the second,
       etc.

       A  piece  is  an  _a_t_o_m possibly followed by a single|- `*',
       `+', `?', or _b_o_u_n_d.  An atom followed  by  `*'  matches  a
       sequence  of  0 or more matches of the atom.  An atom fol-
       lowed by `+' matches a sequence of 1 or  more  matches  of
       the atom.  An atom followed by `?' matches a sequence of 0
       or 1 matches of the atom.

       A _b_o_u_n_d is `{' followed by an  unsigned  decimal  integer,
       possibly  followed  by  `,'  possibly  followed by another
       unsigned decimal integer, always  followed  by  `}'.   The
       integers  must  lie between 0 and RE_DUP_MAX (255|-) inclu-
       sive, and if there are two of  them,  the  first  may  not
       exceed the second.  An atom followed by a bound containing
       one integer _i and no comma matches a sequence of exactly _i
       matches of the atom.  An atom followed by a bound contain-
       ing one integer _i and a comma matches a sequence of  _i  or
       more  matches  of  the  atom.  An atom followed by a bound
       containing two integers _i and _j matches a  sequence  of  _i
       through _j (inclusive) matches of the atom.

       An atom is a regular expression enclosed in `()' (matching
       a match for the regular expression), an empty set of  `()'
       (matching  the  null  string)|-,  a _b_r_a_c_k_e_t _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n (see
       below), `.'  (matching any single character), `^'  (match-
       ing  the  null  string  at  the  beginning of a line), `$'
       (matching the null string at the end of  a  line),  a  `\'
       followed by one of the characters `^.[$()|*+?{\' (matching
       that character taken as an ordinary character), a `\' fol-
       lowed  by  any  other  character|- (matching that character

       taken as an ordinary character, as if the `\' had not been
       present|-),  or  a  single character with no other signifi-
       cance (matching that character).   A  `{'  followed  by  a
       character other than a digit is an ordinary character, not
       the beginning of a bound|-.  It is illegal  to  end  an  RE
       with `\'.

       A  _b_r_a_c_k_e_t  _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n is a list of characters enclosed in
       `[]'.  It normally matches any single character  from  the
       list  (but  see  below).   If the list begins with `^', it
       matches any single character (but see below) _n_o_t from  the
       rest of the list.  If two characters in the list are sepa-
       rated by `-', this is shorthand  for  the  full  _r_a_n_g_e  of
       characters  between those two (inclusive) in the collating
       sequence, e.g. `[0-9]' in ASCII matches any decimal digit.
       It  is  illegal|- for two ranges to share an endpoint, e.g.
       `a-c-e'.  Ranges  are  very  collating-sequence-dependent,
       and portable programs should avoid relying on them.

       To  include  a  literal `]' in the list, make it the first
       character (following a possible `^').  To include  a  lit-
       eral `-', make it the first or last character, or the sec-
       ond endpoint of a range.  To use  a  literal  `-'  as  the
       first  endpoint of a range, enclose it in `[.' and `.]' to
       make it a collating element (see below).  With the  excep-
       tion  of  these  and some combinations using `[' (see next
       paragraphs), all other special characters, including  `\',
       lose  their  special significance within a bracket expres-
       sion.

       Within a bracket expression, a collating element (a  char-
       acter,  a  multi-character sequence that collates as if it
       were a single character, or a collating-sequence name  for
       either)  enclosed in `[.' and `.]' stands for the sequence
       of characters of that collating element.  The sequence  is
       a  single  element  of  the  bracket expression's list.  A
       bracket expression containing a multi-character  collating
       element  can  thus  match more than one character, e.g. if
       the collating sequence includes a `ch' collating  element,
       then the RE `[[.ch.]]*c' matches the first five characters
       of `chchcc'.

       Within a bracket expression, a collating element  enclosed
       in `[=' and `=]' is an equivalence class, standing for the
       sequences of characters of all collating elements  equiva-
       lent  to  that  one,  including  itself.  (If there are no
       other equivalent collating elements, the treatment  is  as
       if  the  enclosing  delimiters  were  `[.' and `.]'.)  For
       example, if o and o^ are  the  members  of  an  equivalence
       class,  then `[[=o=]]', `[[=o^=]]', and `[oo^]' are all syn-
       onymous.  An equivalence class may not|- be an endpoint  of

       a range.

       Within a bracket expression, the name of a _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r _c_l_a_s_s
       enclosed in `[:' and `:]' stands for the list of all char-
       acters  belonging to that class.  Standard character class
       names are:

              alnum       digit       punct
              alpha       graph       space
              blank       lower       upper
              cntrl       print       xdigit

       These stand for the character classes defined in _c_t_y_p_e(3).
       A locale may provide others.  A character class may not be
       used as an endpoint of a range.

       There are two special cases|- of bracket  expressions:  the
       bracket expressions `[[:<:]]' and `[[:>:]]' match the null
       string at the beginning and end of a word respectively.  A
       word  is  defined  as  a  sequence of _a_l_n_u_m characters (as
       defined by _c_t_y_p_e(3)) which is neither  preceded  nor  fol-
       lowed by _a_l_n_u_m characters.  This is an extension, compati-
       ble with but not specified by POSIX 1003.2, and should  be
       used  with  caution in software intended to be portable to
       other systems.

       In the event that an RE could match  more  than  one  sub-
       string  of a given string, the RE matches the one starting
       earliest in the string.  If the RE could match  more  than
       one  substring  starting  at  that  point,  it matches the
       longest.  Subexpressions also match the  longest  possible
       substrings, subject to the constraint that the whole match
       be as long as possible, with subexpressions starting  ear-
       lier  in  the RE taking priority over ones starting later.
       Note that higher-level subexpressions thus  take  priority
       over their lower-level component subexpressions.

       Match  lengths  are  measured in characters, not collating
       elements.  A null string  is  considered  longer  than  no
       match at all.  For example, `bb*' matches the three middle
       characters   of   `abbbc',    `(wee|week)(knights|nights)'
       matches  all ten characters of `weeknights', when `(.*).*'
       is matched against `abc' the  parenthesized  subexpression
       matches  all three characters, and when `(a*)*' is matched
       against `bc' both  the  whole  RE  and  the  parenthesized
       subexpression match the null string.

       If  case-independent  matching is specified, the effect is
       much as if all case distinctions  had  vanished  from  the
       alphabet.   When  an  alphabetic  that  exists in multiple
       cases appears as an ordinary character outside  a  bracket

       expression,  it  is effectively transformed into a bracket
       expression containing both cases, e.g. `x' becomes `[xX]'.
       When  it  appears  inside  a  bracket expression, all case
       counterparts of it are added to the bracket expression, so
       that  (e.g.)  `[x]'  becomes  `[xX]'  and  `[^x]'  becomes
       `[^xX]'.

       No particular limit is imposed  on  the  length  of  REs|-.
       Programs  intended  to  be  portable should not employ REs
       longer than 256 bytes, as an implementation can refuse  to
       accept such REs and remain POSIX-compliant.

       Obsolete (``basic'') regular expressions differ in several
       respects.  `|', `+', and `?' are ordinary  characters  and
       there  is  no  equivalent  for  their  functionality.  The
       delimiters for bounds are `\{' and `\}', with `{' and  `}'
       by  themselves  ordinary  characters.  The parentheses for
       nested subexpressions are `\(' and `\)', with `(' and  `)'
       by  themselves  ordinary  characters.   `^' is an ordinary
       character except at the beginning of the RE or|- the begin-
       ning  of a parenthesized subexpression, `$' is an ordinary
       character except at the end of the RE or|-  the  end  of  a
       parenthesized  subexpression, and `*' is an ordinary char-
       acter if it appears at the beginning  of  the  RE  or  the
       beginning of a parenthesized subexpression (after a possi-
       ble leading `^').  Finally, there is one new type of atom,
       a _b_a_c_k _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e: `\' followed by a non-zero decimal digit
       _d matches the same sequence of characters matched  by  the
       _dth  parenthesized subexpression (numbering subexpressions
       by the positions of their  opening  parentheses,  left  to
       right),  so  that (e.g.) `\([bc]\)\1' matches `bb' or `cc'
       but not `bc'.

       Having two kinds of REs is a botch.

       The current 1003.2 spec says that `)' is an ordinary char-

       unintentional result of a wording  error,  and  change  is
       likely.  Avoid relying on it.

       Back  references  are a dreadful botch, posing major prob-
       lems for efficient implementations.  They are  also  some-
       what   vaguely   defined   (does  `a\(\(b\)*\2\)*d'  match
       `abbbd'?).  Avoid using them.
