       The _k_i_n_i_t command is used to login to the Kerberos authen-
       tication and authorization system.  Note that only  regis-
       tered  Kerberos  users  can  use the Kerberos system.  For
       information about registering as a Kerberos user, see  the
       _k_e_r_b_e_r_o_s_(_1_) manual page.

       If  you are logged in to a workstation that is running the
       _t_o_e_h_o_l_d service, you do not have to use _k_i_n_i_t_.   The  _t_o_e_-
       _h_o_l_d  login procedure will log you into Kerberos automati-
       cally.  You will need to use _k_i_n_i_t only  in  those  situa-
       tions in which your original tickets have expired.  (Tick-
       ets expire in about a day.)  Note  as  well  that  _t_o_e_h_o_l_d
       will  automatically  destroy  your tickets when you logout
       from the workstation.

       When you use _k_i_n_i_t without options,  the  utility  prompts
       for  your  username  and  Kerberos  password, and tries to
       authenticate your login with the local Kerberos server.

       If  Kerberos  authenticates  the  login   attempt,   _k_i_n_i_t
       retrieves  your  initial  ticket and puts it in the ticket
       file specified by your KRBTKFILE environment variable.  If
       this  variable is undefined, your ticket will be stored in
       the _/_t_m_p directory, in the file _t_k_t_u_i_d _, where _u_i_d  speci-
       fies your user identification number.

       If  you  have logged in to Kerberos without the benefit of
       the workstation _t_o_e_h_o_l_d system, make sure you use the _k_d_e_-
       _s_t_r_o_y command to destroy any active tickets before you end
       your login session.  You may want to put the _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y com-
       mand  in  your  _._l_o_g_o_u_t  file so that your tickets will be
       destroyed automatically when you logout.

       The options to _k_i_n_i_t are as follows:

       --ii     _k_i_n_i_t prompts you for a Kerberos instance.

       --rr     _k_i_n_i_t prompts  you  for  a  Kerberos  realm.   This
              option lets you authenticate yourself with a remote
              Kerberos server.

       --vv     Verbose mode.  _k_i_n_i_t prints the name of the  ticket
              file used, and a status message indicating the suc-
              cess or failure of your login attempt.

       --ll     _k_i_n_i_t prompts you for a ticket lifetime in minutes.
              Due to protocol restrictions in Kerberos Version 4,
              this value must be between 5 and 1275 minutes.
