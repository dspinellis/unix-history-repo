       This manual page describes the GNU version of ttrrooffff, which
       is part of the groff document formatting  system.   It  is
       highly  compatible  with Unix troff.  Usually it should be
       invoked using the groff command, which will also run  pre-
       processors and postprocessors in the appropriate order and
       with the appropriate options.

                 in the backtrace may not always correct: troff's

   FFrraaccttiioonnaall ppooiinnttssiizzeess
       A  _s_c_a_l_e_d  _p_o_i_n_t  is  equal  to  1/sizescale points, where
       sizescale is specified in the DDEESSCC file  (1  by  default.)
       There  is  a new scale indicator zz which has the effect of
       multiplying by sizescale.  Requests and  escape  sequences
       in troff interpret arguments that represent a pointsize as
       being in units of scaled points, but  they  evaluate  each
       such argument using a default scale indicator of zz.  Argu-
       ments treated in this way  are  the  argument  to  the  ppss
       request,  the third argument to the ccss request, the second
       and fourth arguments to the ttkkff request, the  argument  to
       the  \\HH  escape  sequence,  and  those  variants of the \\ss
       escape sequence that take a numeric  expression  as  their
       argument.

       For  example,  suppose  sizescale  is  1000; then a scaled
       point will be equivalent to a millipoint; the request  ..ppss
       1100..2255  is  equivalent to ..ppss 1100..2255zz and so sets the point-
       size to 10250 scaled  points,  which  is  equal  to  10.25
       points.

       The  number register \\nn((..ss returns the pointsize in points
       as decimal fraction.  There is also a new number  register
       \\nn[[..ppss]] that returns the pointsize in scaled points.

       It  would  make no sense to use the zz scale indicator in a
       numeric expression whose default scale indicator was  nei-
       ther  uu nor zz, and so ttrrooffff disallows this.  Similarily it
       would make no sense to use a scaling indicator other  than
       zz or uu in a numeric expression whose default scale indica-
       tor was zz, and so ttrrooffff disallows this as well.

       There is also new scale indicator ss  which  multiplies  by
       the  number  of units in a scaled point.  So, for example,
       \\nn[[..ppss]]ss is equal to 11mm.  Be sure not to confuse the ss and
       zz scale indicators.

   NNuummeerriicc eexxpprreessssiioonnss
       Spaces  are permitted in a number expression within paren-
       theses.

       MM indicates a scale of 100ths of an em.

       _e_1>>??_e_2 The maximum of _e_1 and _e_2.

       _e_1<<??_e_2 The minimum of _e_1 and _e_2.

       ((_c;;_e))  Evaluate _e using _c as the default  scaling  indica-
              tor.  If _c is missing, ignore scaling indicators in
              the evaluation of _e.

       \\AA''_a_n_y_t_h_i_n_g''
              This expands to 11 or 00 according as _a_n_y_t_h_i_n_g is  or
              is  not  acceptable as the name of a string, macro,
              diversion, number register,  environment  or  font.
              It  will  return  00  if _a_n_y_t_h_i_n_g is empty.  This is
              useful if you want to lookup  user  input  in  some
              sort of associative table.

       \\CC''_x_x_x''
              Typeset  character  named _x_x_x.  Normally it is more
              convenient to use \\[[_x_x_x]].  But \\CC has the advantage
              that  it is compatible with recent versions of UNIX
              and is available in compatibility mode.

       \\EE     This is equivalent to an escape character, but it's
              not interpreted in copy-mode.  For example, strings
              to start and end superscripting  could  be  defined
              like this:

                     .ds { \v'-.3m'\s'\En[.s]*6u/10u'
                     .ds } \s0\v'.3m'

              The  use  of \\EE ensures that these definitions will
              work even if \\**{{ gets interpreted in copy-mode (for
              example, by being used in a macro argument.)

       \\NN''_n''  Typeset  the  character  with code _n in the current
              font.  _n can be any  integer.   Most  devices  only
              have  characters  with codes between 0 and 255.  If
              the current font does not contain a character  with
              that code, special fonts will _n_o_t be searched.  The
              \\NN escape sequence can be conveniently used on con-
              junction with the cchhaarr request:

                     ..cchhaarr \\[[pphhoonnee]] \\ff((ZZDD\\NN''3377''

              The  code  of each character is given in the fourth
              column in  the  font  description  file  after  the
              cchhaarrsseett command.  It is possible to include unnamed
              characters in the font description file by using  a
              name of ------; the \\NN escape sequence is the only way
              to use these.

       \\RR''_n_a_m_e _+_-_n''
              This has the same effect as

                     ..nnrr _n_a_m_e _+_-_n

              However the contents of the string or macro _x_x_x are

              lines  (it  is not permitted for the argument to \\XX
              to contain newlines).  The  inclusion  of  newlines
              requires an extension to the Unix troff output for-

              embed  _a_n_y_t_h_i_n_g in the diversion.  _a_n_y_t_h_i_n_g is read
              in copy mode.  When the diversion is  reread,  _a_n_y_-

              also recognised in copy mode and turned into a sin-

       \\//     This increases the width of the preceding character

              following character will be correct if the  follow-
              ing  character  is a roman character.  For example,
              if an italic f is immediately followed by  a  roman
              right parenthesis, then in many fonts the top right
              portion of the f will overlap the top left  of  the
              right  parenthesis  producing  _f),  which  is ugly.
              Inserting \\// produces _f) and avoids  this  problem.
              It is a good idea to use this escape sequence when-
              ever an italic character is immediately followed by

              acter _c needs to be printed, _s_t_r_i_n_g  will  be  pro-
              cessed  in  a  temporary environment and the result
              will be wrapped up into a single object.   Compati-
              bility mode will be turned off and the escape char-
              acter will be set to \\ while _s_t_r_i_n_g is  being  pro-
              cessed.  Any emboldening, constant spacing or track
              kerning will be applied to this object rather  than
              to  individual  characters  in _s_t_r_i_n_g.  A character
              defined by this request can be  used  just  like  a
              normal character provided by the output device.  In
              particular other characters can be translated to it
              with  the  ttrr  request;  it  can be made the leader
              character by the llcc request; repeated patterns  can
              be  drawn  with  the  character using the \\ll and \\LL
              escape sequences; words  containing  the  character
              can  be  hyphenated correctly, if the hhccooddee request
              is used to give the character a  hyphenation  code.
              There  is  a special anti-recursion feature: use of
              character within the character's definition will be
              handled  like  normal  characters  not defined with
              cchhaarr.  A character definition can be  removed  with
              the rrcchhaarr request.

              When  the current font is _f, fonts _s_1, _s_2,...  will
              be special, that is, they will searched for charac-
              ters  not in the current font.  Any fonts specified
              in the ssppeecciiaall  request  will  be  searched  before
              fonts specified in the ffssppeecciiaall request.

       ..ffttrr _f _g
              Translate  font _f to _g.  Whenever a font named _f is
              referred to in \\ff escape sequence, or  in  the  fftt,
              uull,  bbdd,  ccss,  ttkkff,  ssppeecciiaall,  ffssppeecciiaall, ffpp, or ssttyy
              requests, font _g will be used.  If _g is missing, or
              equal to _f then font _f will not be translated.

              and that of _c_2 to _c_o_d_e_2.  A hyphenation  code  must
              be  a single input character (not a special charac-
              ter) other than a digit or a space.  Initially each
              lower-case  letter has a hyphenation code, which is
              itself, and each upper-case letter  has  a  hyphen-
              ation  code  which  is  the  lower  case version of
              itself.  See also the hhppff request.

       ..hhllaa _l_a_n_g
              Set  the  current  hyphenation  language  to  _l_a_n_g.
              Hyphenation   exceptions   specified  with  the  hhww
              request and hyphenation patterns specified with the

              duces a comment that continues to the  end  of  the

              printed as well, because they can affect the prior-
              ity of subsequently planted traps.

       ..rrcchhaarr _c_1 _c_2_._._.
              Remove the definitions  of  characters  _c_1,  _c_2,...
              This undoes the effect of a cchhaarr request.

       ..rrjj
       ..rrjj _n  Right  justify  the next _n input lines.  Without an
              argument right justify the next  input  line.   The
              number  of  lines to be right justifed is available
              in the  \\nn[[..rrjj]]  register.   This  implicitly  does
              ..ccee 00.  The ccee request implicitly does ..rrjj 00.

       ..rrnnnn _x_x _y_y
              Rename number register _x_x to _y_y.

       ..sshhcc _c Set  the soft hyphen character to _c.  If _c is omit-
              ted, the soft hyphen character will be set  to  the
              default  \\((hhyy.   The  soft  hyphen character is the
              character which will be inserted  when  a  word  is
              hyphenated  at  a  line  break.  If the soft hyphen
              character does not exist in the font of the charac-
              ter  immediately preceding a potential break point,
              then the line will not be  broken  at  that  point.
              Neither   definitions   (specified  with  the  cchhaarr
              request) nor translations (specified  with  the  ttrr
              request)  are  considered  when  finding  the  soft
              hyphen character.

       ..sshhiifftt _n
              In a macro, shift the  arguments  by  _n  positions:
              argument  _i  becomes argument _i-_n; arguments 1 to _n
              will no longer be  available.   If  _n  is  missing,
              arguments  will be shifted by 1.  Shifting by nega-
              tive amounts is currently undefined.

       ..ssppeecciiaall _s_1 _s_2_._._.
              Fonts _s_1, _s_2, are special and will be searched  for
              characters not in the current font.

       ..ssttyy _n _f
              Associate  style  _f  with  font position _n.  A font
              position can be associated either with  a  font  or
              with  a  style.  The current font is the index of a
              font position and so is also either  a  font  or  a
              style.   When it is a style, the font that is actu-
              ally used is the font the name of which is the con-
              catenation  of  the  name of the current family and
              the name of the current style.  For example, if the
              current font is 1 and font position 1 is associated
              with style RR and the current font family is TT, then
              font TTRR will be used.  If the current font is not a
              style, then the current family  is  ignored.   When
              the  requests  ccss,  bbdd,  ttkkff,  uuff,  or ffssppeecciiaall are
              applied to a  style,  then  they  will  instead  be
              applied  to the member of the current family corre-
              sponding to that style.  The default family can  be
              set  with the --ff option.  The styles command in the
              DESC file controls which font  positions  (if  any)
              are  initially  associated  with styles rather than
              fonts.

       ..ttkkff _f _s_1 _n_1 _s_2 _n_2
              Enable track kerning for font _f.  When the  current
              font  is  _f  the  width  of every character will be
              increased by an amount between _n_1 and _n_2; when  the
              current  point size is less than or equal to _s_1 the
              width will be increased by _n_1; when it  is  greater
              than  or equal to _s_2 the width will be increased by
              _n_2; when the point size is greater than or equal to
              _s_1  and  less  than  or equal to _s_2 the increase in
              width is a linear function of the point size.

       ..ttrrff _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              Transparently output the contents of file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.
              Each line is output as it would be were it preceded
              by \\!!; however, the lines are not subject to  copy-
              mode interpretation.  If the file does not end with
              a newline, then a newline will be added.  For exam-
              ple,  you  can define a macro _x containing the con-
              tents of file _f, using

                     ..ddii _x
                     ..ttrrff _f

              input characters.

       ..ttrrnntt aabbccdd
              This is the same as the ttrr request except that  the

              ently throughput into a  diversion  with  \\!!.   For

              ..ddii xx
              \\!!..ttmm aa
              ..ddii
              ..xx

              will print bb; if ttrrnntt is used instead of ttrr it will
              print aa.

       ..ttrrooffff Make the nn built-in  condition  false,  and  the  tt
              built-in condition true.  This undoes the effect of
              the nnrrooffff request.

       ..vvpptt _n Enable vertical position traps if  _n  is  non-zero,
              disable  them  otherwise.   Vertical position traps
              are traps set by the wwhh or ddtt requests.  Traps  set
              by  the iitt request are not vertical position traps.
              The parameter that controls whether vertical  posi-
              tion traps are enabled is global.  Initially verti-
              cal position traps are enabled.

       ..wwaarrnn _n
              Control warnings.  _n is  the  sum  of  the  numbers
              associated with each warning that is to be enabled;
              all other warnings will be  disabled.   The  number
              associated  with  each  warning  is  listed  in the
              `Warnings' section.  For example, ..wwaarrnn 00 will dis-
              able  all  warnings,  and  ..wwaarrnn 11 will disable all
              warnings except that about missing characters.   If
              _n is not given, all warnings will be enabled.

       ..wwhhiillee _c _a_n_y_t_h_i_n_g
              While  condition  _c  is  true,  accept  _a_n_y_t_h_i_n_g as
              input; _c can be any condition acceptable to  an  iiff
              request;  _a_n_y_t_h_i_n_g  can  comprise multiple lines if
              the first line starts with \\{{  and  the  last  line

              request.  _a_n_y_t_h_i_n_g is read in copy mode; a  leading

       ..ccff _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              When  used  in  a diversion, this will embed in the
              diversion an object which, when reread, will  cause
              the contents of _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e to be transparently copied
              through to the output.  In Unix troff, the contents
              of  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e  is  immediately copied through to the
              output regardless of whether  there  is  a  current
              diversion;  this  behaviour is so anomalous that it
              must be considered a bug.

       ..eevv _x_x If _x_x is not a number, this will switch to a  named
              environment  called  _x_x.  The environment should be
              popped with a matching eevv request without any argu-
              ments, just as for numbered environments.  There is
              no limit on the number of named environments;  they
              will be created the first time that they are refer-
              enced.

       ..ffpp _n _f_1 _f_2
              The ffpp request  has  an  optional  third  argument.
              This  argument gives the external name of the font,
              which is used  for  finding  the  font  description
              file.   The second argument gives the internal name
              of the font which is used to refer to the  font  in
              troff  after  it  has been mounted.  If there is no
              third argument then the internal name will be  used
              as  the  external name.  This feature allows you to
              use fonts with long names in compatibility mode.

       ..ssss _m _n
              When two arguments are given to the ssss request, the
              second  argument gives the _s_e_n_t_e_n_c_e _s_p_a_c_e _s_i_z_e.  If
              the second argument  is  not  given,  the  sentence
              space size will be the same as the word space size.
              Like the word space size, the sentence space is  in
              units  of  one  twelfth of the spacewidth parameter
              for the current  font.   Initially  both  the  word
              space size and the sentence space size are 12.  The
              sentence space size is used in  two  circumstances:
              if  the  end  of  a sentence occurs at the end of a
              line in fill mode, then both  an  inter-word  space
              and  a  sentence space will be added; if two spaces
              follow the end of a sentence in  the  middle  of  a
              line,  then  the  second  space  will be a sentence
              space.  Note that the behaviour of Unix troff  will
              be  exactly that exhibited by GNU troff if a second
              argument is never given to the ssss request.  In  GNU

              extends below the baseline.

       \\nn[[..ccee]]
              The number of lines remaining to  be  centered,  as
              set by the ccee request.

       \\nn[[..cchhtt]]
              The  height of the last character added to the cur-

              extends above the baseline.

       \\nn[[..ccsskk]]
              The skew of the last character added to the current

              the  right  of the center of a character the center
              of an accent over that character should be  placed.

       \\nn[[..eevv]]
              The  name  or  number  of  the current environment.
              This is a string-valued register.

              The current pointsize in scaled points.

       \\nn[[..ppssrr]]
              The last-requested pointsize in scaled points.

       \\nn[[..rrjj]]
              The number of lines to be right-justified as set by
              the rrjj request.

       \\nn[[..ssrr]]
              The last requested pointsize in points as a decimal
              fraction.  This is a string-valued register.

       \\nn[[..ttaabbss]]
              A string representation of the current tab settings
              suitable for use as an argument to the ttaa  request.

       \\nn[[..ttrruunncc]]
              The  amount of vertical space truncated by the most
              recently sprung vertical position trap, or, if  the
              trap  was  sprung by a nnee request, minus the amount
              of vertical motion produced by the nnee request.   In
              other words, at the point a trap is sprung, it rep-
              resents the difference of what the  vertical  posi-
              tion would have been but for the trap, and what the
              vertical position actually is.  Useful in  conjunc-
              tion with the \\nn[[..nnee]] register.

       \\nn[[..ssss]]
       \\nn[[..ssssss]]
              These  give the values of the parameters set by the
              first and second arguments of the ssss request.

       \\nn[[..vvpptt]]
              1 if vertical position traps are enabled, 0  other-
              wise.

       \\nn[[..wwaarrnn]]
              The  sum of the numbers associated with each of the
              currently enabled warnings.  The number  associated
              with  each warning is listed in the `Warnings' sub-
              section.

       \\nn((..xx  The major version number.  For example, if the ver-
              sion number is 11..0033 then \\nn((..xx will contain 11.

       \\nn((..yy  The minor version number.  For example, if the ver-
              sion number is 11..0033 then \\nn((..yy will contain 0033.

       The following registers are set by the \\ww escape sequence:

       \\nn[[rrsstt]]
       \\nn[[rrssbb]]
              Like  the sstt and ssbb registers, but takes account of
              the heights and depths of characters.

       \\nn[[sssscc]]
              The amount of horizontal space (possibly  negative)
              that should be added to the last character before a
              subscript.

       \\nn[[sskkww]]
              How far to right of the center of the last  charac-
              ter  in  the  \\ww  argument, the center of an accent
              from a roman font should be placed over that  char-
              acter.

       The following read/write number registers are available:

       \\nn[[ssyyssttaatt]]
              The  return value of the system() function executed
              by the last ssyy request.

       \\nn[[sslliimmiitt]]
              If greater than 0, the maximum number of objects on
              the input stack.  If less than or equal to 0, there
              is no limit on the number of objects on  the  input
              stack.  With no limit, recursion can continue until
              virtual memory is exhausted.

       Fonts not  listed  in  the  DESC  file  are  automatically
       mounted  on the next available font position when they are
       referenced.  If a font is to be  mounted  explicitly  with
       the  ffpp  request  on an unused font position, it should be
       mounted on the first unused font position,  which  can  be
       found  in  the  \\nn[[..ffpp]]  register; although ttrrooffff does not
       enforce this strictly, it will not  allow  a  font  to  be
       mounted  at  a  position whose number is much greater than
       that of any currently used position.

       Interpolating a string does not hide existing macro  argu-
       ments.  Thus in a macro, a more efficient way of doing

              .._x_x \\\\$$@@

       is

              \\\\**[[_x_x]]\\\\

       If  the  font  description  file contains pairwise kerning
       information, characters from that  font  will  be  kerned.

       Kerning between two characters can be inhibited by placing
       a \\&& between them.

       In a string comparison in  a  condition,  characters  that
       appear  at  different  input levels to the first delimiter
       character will not be recognised as the  second  or  third
       delimiters.  This applies also to the ttll request.  In a \\ww
       escape sequence, a character that appears at  a  different
       input  level  to the starting delimiter character will not
       be recognised as the closing  delimiter  character.   When
       decoding  a  macro  argument  that  is delimited by double
       quotes, a character that  appears  at  a  different  input
       level  to  the  starting  delimiter  character will not be
       recognised as the closing delimiter character.  The imple-
       mentation  of \\$$@@ ensures that the double quotes surround-
       ing an argument will appear the same  input  level,  which
       will  be  different  to  the  input  level of the argument
       itself.  In a long escape name ]] will not be recognized as
       a  closing  delimiter  except  when  it occurs at the same
       input level as the opening ]].  In compatibility  mode,  no
       attention is paid to the input-level.

       There are some new types of condition:

       ..iiff rr_x_x_x
              True if there is a number register named _x_x_x.

       ..iiff dd_x_x_x
              True  if  there  is  a string, macro, diversion, or
              request named _x_x_x.

       ..iiff cc_c_h
              True if there is a character _c_h  available;  _c_h  is
              either  an  ASCII  character or a special character
              \\((_x_x or \\[[_x_x_x]]; the condition will also be true  if
              _c_h has been defined by the cchhaarr request.

   WWaarrnniinnggss
       The  warnings  that can be given by ttrrooffff are divided into
       the following categories.  The name associated  with  each
       warning  is  used  by the --ww and --WW options; the number is
       used by the wwaarrnn request, and by the ..wwaarrnn register.

       cchhaarr           1   Non-existent   characters.    This   is
                          enabled by default.

                          macro or diversion is used, that string
                          is automatically defined as empty.  So,
                          in most cases, at most one warning will
                          be given for each name.

                          defined  to have a value of 0.  a defi-

                          value of 0.  So, in most cases, at most

       Long  names cause some incompatibilities.  Unix troff will
       interpret

              ..ddssaabbccdd

       as defining a string aabb with contents ccdd.   Normally,  GNU
       troff  will  interpret  this  as  a  call of a macro named
       ddssaabbccdd.  Also Unix troff will interpret \\**[[ or \\nn[[ as ref-
       erences  to  a string or number register called [[.  In GNU
       troff, however, this will normally be interpreted  as  the
       start  of  a  long  name.  In _c_o_m_p_a_t_i_b_i_l_i_t_y _m_o_d_e GNU troff
       will interpret these things in the  traditional  way.   In
       compatibility  mode,  however,  long  names are not recog-
       nised.  Compatibility mode can be turned on  with  the  --CC
       command  line  option,  and  turned  on or off with the ccpp
       request.  The number register \\nn((..CC is 1 if  compatibility
       mode is on, 0 otherwise.

       GNU  troff  does not allow the use of the escape sequences
       \\\\||\\^^\\&&\\}}\\{{\\(space)\\''\\``\\--\\__\\!!\\%%\\cc  in  names  of  strings,
       macros,  diversions,  number  registers, fonts or environ-
       ments; Unix troff does.  The \\AA  escape  sequence  may  be
       helpful  in  avoiding  use  of  these  escape sequences in
       names.

       Fractional pointsizes cause one  noteworthy  incompatibil-
       ity.   In  Unix troff the ppss request ignores scale indica-
       tors and so

              ..ppss 1100uu

       will set the pointsize to 10 points, whereas in GNU  troff
       it will set the pointsize to 10 scaled points.

       In  GNU  troff  there  is a fundamental difference between
       unformatted, input characters, and formatted, output char-
       acters.   Everything  that affects how an output character
       will be output is stored with the character; once an  out-
       put character has been constructed it is unaffected by any
       subsequent requests that are executed, including  bbdd,  ccss,
       ttkkff,  ttrr,  or ffpp requests.  Normally output characters are
       constructed from input characters at  the  moment  immedi-
       ately  before the character is added to the current output
       line.  Macros, diversions and strings are  all,  in  fact,
       the same type of object; they contain lists of input char-
       acters and output characters in any combination.  An  out-
       put  character does not behave like an input character for
       the purposes of macro processing; it does not inherit  any
       of  the  special  properties that the input character from
       which it was constructed might have had.  For example,

              ..ddii xx
              \\\\\\\\
              ..bbrr
              ..ddii
              ..xx

       will print \\\\ in GNU troff;  each  pair  of  input  \\s  is
       turned  into  one output \\ and the resulting output \\s are
       not interpreted as escape characters when they are reread.
       Unix  troff would interpret them as escape characters when
       they were reread and would end up  printing  one  \\.   The
       correct  way  to  obtain  a  printable  \\ is to use the \\ee
       escape sequence: this will always print a single  instance
       of  the current escape character, regardless of whether or
       not it is used in a diversion; it will also work  in  both
       GNU  troff and Unix troff.  If you wish for some reason to
       store in a diversion  an  escape  sequence  that  will  be
       interpreted  when  the diversion is reread, you can either
       use the traditional \\!!  transparent output  facility,  or,
       if this is unsuitable, the new \\??  escape sequence.
