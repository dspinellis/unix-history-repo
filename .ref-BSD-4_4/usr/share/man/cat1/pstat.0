     PPssttaatt displays open file entry, swap space utilization, terminal state,
     and vnode data structures.  If _c_o_r_e_f_i_l_e is given, the information is
     sought there, otherwise in _/_d_e_v_/_k_m_e_m. The required namelist is taken from
     _/_v_m_u_n_i_x unless _s_y_s_t_e_m is specified.  The --nn option specifies that devices
     should be printed out by major/minor number rather than by name.

     Options are

     --TT      Prints the number of used and free slots in the several system
             tables and is useful for checking to see how large system tables
             have become if the system is under heavy load.

     --ff      Print the open file table with these headings:

             LOC     The core location of this table entry.

             TYPE    The type of object the file table entry points to.

             FLG     Miscellaneous state variables encoded thus:

                     R       open for reading

                     W       open for writing

                     A       open for appending

                     S       shared lock present

                     X       exclusive lock present

                     I       signal pgrp when data ready

             CNT     Number of processes that know this open file.

             MSG     Number of messages outstanding for this file.

             DATA    The location of the vnode table entry or socket structure
                     for this file.

             OFFSET  The file offset (see lseek(2)).

     --ss      Print information about swap space usage on all the swap areas
             compiled into the kernel.  The first column is the device name of
             the partition.  The next column is the total space available in
             the partition.  The _U_s_e_d column indicates the total blocks used
             so far;  the _A_v_a_i_l_a_b_l_e column indicates how much space is remain-
             ing on each partition.  The _C_a_p_a_c_i_t_y reports the percentage of
             space used.

             If more than one partition is configured into the system, totals
             for all of the statistics will be reported in the final line of
             the report.

     --tt      Print table for terminals with these headings:


             RAW     Number of characters in raw input queue.

             CAN     Number of characters in canonicalized input queue.

             OUT     Number of characters in putput queue.

             MODE    See tty(4).

             ADDR    Physical device address.

             DEL     Number of delimiters (newlines) in canonicalized input
                     queue.

             COL     Calculated column position of terminal.

             STATE   Miscellaneous state variables encoded thus:

                     T       delay timeout in progress

                     W       waiting for open to complete

                     O       open

                     F       outq has been flushed during DMA

                     C       carrier is on

                     B       busy doing output

                     A       process is awaiting output

                     X       open for exclusive use

                     S       output stopped

                     H       hangup on close

             PGRP    Process group for which this is controlling terminal.

             DISC    Line discipline; blank is old tty OTTYDISC or `new tty'
                     for NTTYDISC or `net' for NETLDISC (see bk(4)).

     --vv      Print the active vnodes.  Each group of vnodes coresponding to a
             particular filesystem is preceded by a two line header.  The
             first line consists of the following:

             *** MOUNT _f_s_t_y_p_e _f_r_o_m on _o_n _f_s_f_l_a_g_s

             where _f_s_t_y_p_e is one of _u_f_s, _n_f_s, _m_f_s, _o_r _p_c; _f_r_o_m is the filesys-
             tem is mounted from; _o_n is the directory the filesystem is mount-
             ed on; and _f_s_f_l_a_g_s is a list of optional flags applied to the
             mount (see mount(8)).  the first part of which are fixed, and the
             second part are filesystem type specific.  The headers common to
             all vnodes are:

             ADDR    Location of this vnode.

             TYP     File type.

             VFLAG

                     A list of letters representing vnode flags:

                     T       - VTEXT

             WRC     Reference count of exclusive locks on the inode (this may
