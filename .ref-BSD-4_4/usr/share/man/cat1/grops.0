       ggrrooppss translates the output of GNU  ttrrooffff  to  PostScript.
       Normally  ggrrooppss  should be invoked by using the groff com-
       mand with a --TTppss option.  (Actually, this is  the  default
       for  groff.)   If  no files are given, ggrrooppss will read the
       standard input.  A filename of -- will also cause ggrrooppss  to
       read  the standard input.  PostScript output is written to
       the standard output.  When ggrrooppss is run by  ggrrooffff  options
       can be passed to ggrrooppss using the ggrrooffff --PP option.

              mally ggrrooppss produces output that conforms the Docu-
              ment Structuring Conventions version 3.0.  Unfortu-
              nately some spoolers and  previewers  can't  handle
              such  output.   The  value of _n controls what ggrrooppss
              does to its output acceptable to such programs.   A
              value  of  0  will  cause  grops  not to employ any
              workarounds.  Add 1 if no %%%%BBeeggiinnDDooccuummeennttSSeettuupp  and

              this is needed for  early  versions  of  TranScript

       There  are  also some special fonts called SSSS and SS.  Zapf
       Dingbats is avilable as  ZZDD  and  a  reversed  version  of
       ZapfDingbats (with symbols pointing in the opposite direc-
       tion) is available as ZZDDRR; most characters in these  fonts
       are unnamed and must be accessed using \\NN.

              _c_o_d_e.  The PostScript currentpoint will be  set  to
              the  position  of  the  \\XX command before executing
              _c_o_d_e.  The origin will be at the top left corner of
              the  page, and y coordinates will increase down the
              page.  A procedure uu will be defined that  converts
              groff  units  to  the  coordinate system in effect.
              For example,

                     ..nnrr xx 11ii
                     \\XX''ppss:: eexxeecc \\nnxx uu 00 rrlliinneettoo ssttrrookkee''

              will draw a horizontal line one  inch  long.   _c_o_d_e
              may  make  changes  to  the graphics state, but any
              changes will persist only to the end of  the  page.
              Any  definitions  will  also persist only until the
              end of the page.  If you use the \\YY escape sequence
              with  an  argument  that  names  a  macro, _c_o_d_e can
              extend over multiple lines.  For example,

                     ..nnrr xx 11ii
                     ..ddee yy
                     ppss:: eexxeecc

                     ssttrrookkee
                     ....
                     \\YYyy

              is another way to draw a horizontal line  one  inch
              long.

       \\XX''ppss:: ffiillee _n_a_m_e''
              This  is  the  same as the eexxeecc command except that
              the PostScript code is read from file _n_a_m_e.

       \\XX''ppss:: ddeeff _c_o_d_e''
              Place a PostScript definition contained in _c_o_d_e  in
              the  prologue.  There should be at most one defini-
              tion per \\XX command.  Long definitions can be split
              over  several  \\XX  commands; all the _c_o_d_e arguments
              are simply joined together separated  by  newlines.
              The definitions are placed in a dictionary which is
              automatically pushed on the dictionary  stack  when
              an  eexxeecc  command  is  executed.  If you use the \\YY
              escape sequence  with  an  argument  that  names  a
              macro, _c_o_d_e can extend over multiple lines.

       \\XX''ppss:: mmddeeff _n _c_o_d_e''
              Like ddeeff, except that _c_o_d_e may contain up to _n def-
              initions.  ggrrooppss needs to know how many definitions
              _c_o_d_e  contains  so that it can create an apppropri-
              ately sized PostScript dictionary to contain  them.

              of the graphic in the default PostScript coordinate
              system; they should all be integers;  _l_l_x  and  _l_l_y
              are  the x and y coordinates of the lower left cor-
              ner of the graphic; _u_r_x and _u_r_y are  the  x  and  y
              coordinates  of  the  upper  right  corner  of  the
              graphic; _w_i_d_t_h and _h_e_i_g_h_t are  integers  that  give
              the  desired width and height in groff units of the
              graphic.  The graphic will be scaled so that it has
              this  width  and  height and translated so that the
              lower left corner of the graphic is located at  the
              position associated with \\XX command.  If the height
              argument is omitted it will be scaled uniformly  in
              the x and y directions so that it has the specified
              width.  Note that the contents of  the  \\XX  command
              are not interpreted by ttrrooffff; so vertical space for
              the graphic is not  automatically  added,  and  the
              _w_i_d_t_h  and _h_e_i_g_h_t arguments are not allowed to have
              attached scaling  indicators.   If  the  PostScript
              file  complies  with the Adobe Document Structuring
              Conventions and contains a  %%%%BBoouunnddiinnggBBooxx  comment,
              then   the   bounding   box  can  be  automatically
              extracted from within groff by using the ssyy request
              to run the ppssbbbb command.

              The  --mmppss  macros  (which  are automatically loaded
              when ggrrooppss is run by the groff command)  include  a
              PPSSPPIICC  macro  which  allows  a picture to be easily
              imported.  This has the format

              In this case, ggxxddiittvviieeww will be unable  to  display
              the  \\((eemm character and will draw the line, whereas
              ggrrooppss will print the \\((eemm character and ignore  the
              line.

       The  input  to  ggrrooppss  must  be  in  the  format output by
       ttrrooffff(1).  This is described in ggrrooffff__oouutt(1).  In addition
       the  device and font description files for the device used
       must meet  certain  requirements.   The  device  and  font
       description  files  supplied  for ppss device meet all these
       requirements.  aaffmmttooddiitt(1) can  be  used  to  create  font
       files  from  AFM files.  The resolution must be an integer
       multiple of 72 times the ssiizzeessccaallee.  The ppss device uses  a
       resolution  of  72000 and a sizescale of 1000.  The device
       description file should contain a command

              ppaappeerrlleennggtthh _n

       which says that output should be generated which is  suit-
       able  for  printing  on  a  page whose length is _n machine
       units.  Each font description file must contain a command

       which says that the PostScript name of the font is _p_s_n_a_m_e.
       It may also contain a command

              eennccooddiinngg _e_n_c___f_i_l_e

       which  says  that  the PostScript font should be reencoded
       using the encoding described in _e_n_c___f_i_l_e; this file should
       consist of a sequence of lines of the form:

              _p_s_c_h_a_r _c_o_d_e

       where  _p_s_c_h_a_r is the PostScript name of the character, and
       _c_o_d_e is its position in the encoding expressed as a  deci-
       mal  integer.   The  code  for each character given in the

       font file must correspond to the code for the character in
       encoding  file, or to the code in the default encoding for
       the font if the PostScript font is not  to  be  reencoded.
       This code can be used with the \\NN escape sequence in ttrrooffff
       to select the character, even if the  character  does  not
       have  a groff name.  Every character in the font file must
       exist in the PostScript font, and the widths given in  the
       font  file  must  match  the widths used in the PostScript
       font.  ggrrooppss will assume that a  character  with  a  groff
       name  of  ssppaaccee  is blank (makes no marks on the page); it
       can make use of such a character to  generate  more  effi-
       cient and compact PostScript output.

       ggrrooppss  can  automatically  include  the downloadable fonts
       necessary to print the document.  Any  downloadable  fonts
       which  should, when required, be included by ggrrooppss must be
       listed in the  file  //uussrr//sshhaarree//ggrrooffff__ffoonntt//ddeevvppss//ddoowwnnllooaadd;
       this should consist of lines of the form

              _f_o_n_t  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

       where  _f_o_n_t  is the PostScript name of the font, and _f_i_l_e_-
       _n_a_m_e is the name of the file containing  the  font;  lines
       beginning  with  ## and blank lines are ignored; fields may
       be separated by tabs or spaces; _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e will be  searched
       for  using  the same mechanism that is used for groff font
       metric files.  The  ddoowwnnllooaadd  file  itself  will  also  be
       searched for using this mechanism.

       If  the  file  containing  a downloadable font or imported
       document conforms to the Adobe Document  Structuring  Con-
       ventions,  then  ggrrooppss  will interpret any comments in the
       files sufficiently to ensure that its own output  is  con-
       forming.   It  will  also supply any needed font resources
       that are listed in the ddoowwnnllooaadd file as well as any needed
       file  resources.  It is also able to handle inter-resource
       dependencies.  For example, suppose that you have a  down-
       loadable  font  called  Garamond,  and also a downloadable
       font called Garamond-Outline  which  depends  on  Garamond
       (typically  it  would  be  defined to copy Garamond's font
       dictionary, and change the PaintType), then it  is  neces-
       sary  for Garamond to be appear before Garamond-Outline in
       the PostScript document.  ggrrooppss will handle this automati-
       cally  provided  that the downloadable font file for Gara-
       mond-Outline indicates its dependence on Garamond by means
       of  the  Document  Structuring Conventions, for example by
       beginning with the following lines

       In this case both Garamond and Garamond-Outline would need
