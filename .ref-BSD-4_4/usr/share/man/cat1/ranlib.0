     RRaannlliibb creates a table of external references for archive libraries, nor-
     mally used by the loader, ld(1).  This table is is named ``__.SYMDEF''
     and is prepended to the archive.  Files in the archive which are not exe-
     cutable and symbols which are uninteresting to the loader are ignored.

     The options are as follows:

     --tt      Set the modification time of the __.SYMDEF file.  This time is
             compared by the loader with the modification time of the archive
             to verify that the table is up-to-date with respect to the
             archive.  If the modification time has been changed without any
             change to the archive (for example, by a cp(1)),  the --tt option
             can be used to ``touch'' the modification time so that it appears
             that the table is up-to-date.  This is also useful after using
             the --tt option of make(1).
