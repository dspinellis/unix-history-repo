     LLoocckk requests a password from the user, reads it again for verification
     and then will normally not relinquish the terminal until the password is
     repeated.  There are two other conditions under which it will terminate:
     it will timeout after some interval of time and it may be killed by some-
     one with the appropriate permission.

     Options:

     --pp          A password is not requested, instead the user's current login
                 password is used.

     --tt _t_i_m_e_o_u_t  The time limit (default 15 minutes) is changed to _t_i_m_e_o_u_t
                 minutes.
