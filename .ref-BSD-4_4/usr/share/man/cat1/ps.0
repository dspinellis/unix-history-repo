     PPss displays a header line followed by lines containing information about
     your processes that have controlling terminals.  This information is
     sorted by process ID.

     The information displayed is selected based on a set of keywords (see the
     --LL --OO and --oo options).  The default output format includes, for each pro-
     cess, the process' ID, controlling terminal, cpu time (including both us-
     er and system time), state, and associated command.

     The options are as follows:

     --aa      Display information about other users' processes as well as your
             own.

     --CC      Change the way the cpu percentage is calculated by using a
             ``raw'' cpu calculation that ignores ``resident'' time (this nor-
             mally has no effect).

     --ee      Display the environment as well.

     --hh      Repeat the information header as often as necessary to guarantee
             one header per page of information.

     --jj      Print information associated with the following keywords: user,
             pid, ppid, pgid, sess, jobc, state, tt, time and command.

     --LL      List the set of available keywords.

     --ll      Display information associated with the following keywords: uid,
             pid, ppid, cpu, pri, nice, vsz, rss, wchan, state, tt, time and
             command.

     --MM      Extract values associated with the name list from the specified
             core instead of the default ``_/_d_e_v_/_k_m_e_m''.

     --mm      Sort by memory usage, instead of by process ID.

     --NN      Extract the name list from the specified system instead of the
             default ``_/_v_m_u_n_i_x''.

     --OO      Add the information associated with the space or comma separated
             list of keywords specifed, after the process ID, in the default
             information display.  Keywords may be appended with an equals
             (``='') sign and a string.  This causes the printed header to use
             the specified string instead of the standard header.

     --oo      Display information associated with the space or comma separated
             list of keywords specifed.  Keywords may be appended with an
             equals (``='') sign and a string.  This causes the printed header
             to use the specified string instead of the standard header.

     --pp      Display information associated with the specified process ID.


     --rr      Sort by current cpu usage, instead of by process ID.

     --SS      Change the way the process time is calculated by summing all ex-
             ited children to their parent process.

     --TT      Display information about processes attached to the device asso-
             ciated with the standard input.

     --tt      Display information about processes attached to the specified
             terminal device.

     --uu      Display information associated with the following keywords: user,
             pid, %cpu, %mem, vsz, rss, tt, state, start, time and command.
             The --uu option implies the --rr option.

     --vv      Display information associated with the following keywords: pid,
             state, time, sl, re, pagein, vsz, rss, lim, tsiz, %cpu, %mem and
             command.  The --vv option implies the --mm option.

     --WW      Extract swap information from the specified file instead of the
             default ``_/_d_e_v_/_s_w_a_p''.

     --ww      Use 132 columns to display information, instead of the default
             which is your window size.  If the --ww option is specified more
             than once, ppss will use as many columns as necessary without re-
             gard for your window size.

     --xx      Display information about processes without controlling termi-
             nals.

     A complete list of the available keywords are listed below.  Some of
     these keywords are further specifed as follows:

     %cpu    The cpu utilization of the process; this is a decaying average
             over up to a minute of previous (real) time.  Since the time base
             over which this is computed varies (since processes may be very
             young) it is possible for the sum of all %CPU fields to exceed
             100%.

     %mem    The percentage of real memory used by this process.

     flags   The flags (in hexadecimal) associated with the process as in the
             include file <_s_y_s_/_p_r_o_c_._h>:

     lim     The soft limit on memory used, specified via a call to
             setrlimit(2).

     lstart  The exact time the command started, using the ``%C'' format de-
             scribed in strftime(3).

     nice    The process scheduling increment (see setpriority(2)).

     rss     the real memory (resident set) size of the process (in 1024 byte
             units).

     start   The time the command started.  If the command started less than
             24 hours ago, the start time is displayed using the ``%l:ps.1p''
             format described in strftime(3).  If the command started less
             than 7 days ago, the start time is displayed using the
             ``%a6.15p'' format.  Otherwise, the start time is displayed using
             the ``%e%b%y'' format.

     state   The state is given by a sequence of letters, for example,
             ``RWNA''. The first letter indicates the run state of the pro-
             cess:

             D       Marks a process in disk (or other short term, uninter-
                     ruptable) wait.
             I       Marks a process that is idle (sleeping for longer than
                     about 20 seconds).
             R       Marks a runnable process.
             S       Marks a process that is sleeping for less than about 20
                     seconds.
             T       Marks a stopped process.
             Z       Marks a dead process (a ``zombie'').

             Additional characters after these, if any, indicate additional
             state information:

             +       The process is in the foreground process group of its
                     control terminal.
             <       The process has raised CPU scheduling priority.
             >       The process has specified a soft limit on memory require-
                     ments and is currently exceeding that limit; such a pro-
                     cess is (necessarily) not swapped.
             A       the process has asked for random page replacement
                     (VA_ANOM, from vadvise(2),  for example, lisp(1) in a
                     garbage collect).
             E       The process is trying to exit.
             L       The process has pages locked in core (for example, for
                     raw I/O).
             N       The process has reduced CPU scheduling priority (see
                     setpriority(2)).
             S       The process has asked for FIFO page replacement (VA_SEQL,
                     from vadvise(2),  for example, a large image processing
                     program using virtual memory to sequentially address vo-
                     luminous data).
             s       The process is a session leader.
             V       The process is suspended during a vfork.
             W       The process is swapped out.
             X       The process is being traced or debugged.



     tt      An abbreviation for the pathname of the controlling terminal, if
             any.  The abbreviation consists of the two letters following
             ``_/_d_e_v_/_t_t_y'', or, for the console, ``co''.  This is followed by a
             ``-'' if the process can no longer reach that controlling termi-
             nal (i.e., it has been revoked).

     wchan   The event (an address in the system) on which a process waits.
             When printed numerically, the initial part of the address is
             trimmed off and the result is printed in hex, for example,
             0x80324000 prints as 324000.

     When printing using the command keyword, a process that has exited and
     has a parent that has not yet waited for the process (in other words, a
     zombie) is listed as ``<defunct>'', and a process which is blocked while
     trying to exit is listed as ``<exiting>''.  PPss makes an educated guess as
     to the file name and arguments given when the process was created by ex-
     amining memory or the swap area.  The method is inherently somewhat unre-
     liable and in any event a process is entitled to destroy this informa-
     tion, so the names cannot be depended on too much.  The ucomm (account-
     ing) keyword can, however, be depended on.
