     The uunnaammee command writes the name of the operating system to the standard
     output.  When options are specified, strings representing one or more
     system characteristics are written to the standard output.

     The options are as follows:

     --aa      Behave as though the options --mm, --nn, --rr, --ss, and --vv were speci-
             fied.

     --mm      Write the type of the current hardware platform to standard out-
             put.

     --nn      Write the name of the system to standard output.

     --rr      Write the current release level of the operating system to stan-
             dard output.

     --ss      Write the type of the operating system to standard output.

     --vv      Write the version level of this release of the operating system
             to standard output.

     If the --aa flag is specified, or multiple flags are specified, all output
     is written on a single line, separated by spaces.

     The uunnaammee utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
