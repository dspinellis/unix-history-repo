     The pprr utility is a printing and pagination filter for text files.  When
     multiple input files are specified, each is read, formatted, and written
     to standard output.  By default, the input is separated into 66-line
     pages, each with

     +o A 5-line header with the page number, date, time, and the pathname of
       the file.

     +o A 5-line trailer consisting of blank lines.

     If standard output is associated with a terminal, diagnostic messages are
     suppressed until the pprr utility has completed processing.

     When multiple column output is specified, text columns are of equal
     width.  By default text columns are separated by at least one _<_b_l_a_n_k_>_.
     Input lines that do not fit into a text column are truncated.  Lines are
     not truncated under single column output.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     In the following option descriptions, column, lines, offset, page, and
     width are positive decimal integers and gap is a nonnegative decimal in-
     teger.

     _+_p_a_g_e
           Begin output at page number _p_a_g_e of the formatted input.

     --_c_o_l_u_m_n
           Produce output that is _c_o_l_u_m_n_s wide (default is 1) that is written
           vertically down each column in the order in which the text is re-
           ceived from the input file.  The options --ee and --ii are assumed.
           This option should not be used with --mm. When used with --tt, the min-
           imum number of lines is used to display the output.

     --aa    Modify the effect of the --ccoolluummnn option so that the columns are
           filled across the page in a round-robin order (e.g., when column is
           2, the first input line heads column 1, the second heads column 2,
           the third is the second line in column 1, etc.).  This option re-
           quires the use of the --ccoolluummnn option.

     --dd    Produce output that is double spaced. An extra _<_n_e_w_l_i_n_e_> character
           is output following every <newline> found in the input.

     --ee _[_c_h_a_r_]_[_g_a_p_]
           Expand each input <tab> to the next greater column position speci-
           fied by the formula _n_*_g_a_p_+_1, where _n is an integer > 0.  If _g_a_p is
           zero or is omitted the default is 8.  All _<_t_a_b_> characters in the
           input are expanded into the appropriate number of _<_s_p_a_c_e_>_s. If any
           nondigit character, _c_h_a_r, is specified, it is used as the input tab
           character.

     --FF    Use a _<_f_o_r_m_-_f_e_e_d_> character for new pages, instead of the default
           behavior that uses a sequence o _<_n_e_w_l_i_n_e_> characters.

     --hh _h_e_a_d_e_r
           _h_e_a_d_e_r Use the string _h_e_a_d_e_r to replace the _f_i_l_e _n_a_m_e in the header
           line.

     --ii _[_c_h_a_r_]_[_g_a_p_]
           In output, replace multiple <space>s with <tab>s whenever two or
           more adjacent <space>s reach column positions _g_a_p_+_1, _2_*_g_a_p_+_1, etc.
           If _g_a_p is zero or omitted, default _<_t_a_b_> settings at every eighth
           column position is used.  If any nondigit character, _c_h_a_r, is spec-
           ified, it is used as the output _<_t_a_b_> character.

     --ll _l_i_n_e_s
           Override the 66 line default and reset the page length to _l_i_n_e_s_. If
           _l_i_n_e_s is not greater than the sum of both the header and trailer
           depths (in lines), the pprr utility suppresses output of both the
           header and trailer, as if the --tt option were in effect.

     --mm    Merge the contents of multiple files.  One line from each file
           specified by a file operand is written side by side into text
           columns of equal fixed widths, in terms of the number of column po-
           sitions.  The number of text columns depends on the number of file
           operands successfully opened.  The maximum number of files merged
           depends on page width and the per process open file limit.  The op-
           tions --ee and --ii are assumed.

     --nn _[_c_h_a_r_]_[_w_i_d_t_h_]
           Provide _w_i_d_t_h digit line numbering.  The default for _w_i_d_t_h, if not
           specified, is 5.  The number occupies the first _w_i_d_t_h column posi-
           tions of each text column or each line of --mm output.  If _c_h_a_r (any
           nondigit character) is given, it is appended to the line number to
           separate it from whatever follows. The default for _c_h_a_r is a _<_t_a_b_>.
           Line numbers longer than _w_i_d_t_h columns are truncated.

     --oo _o_f_f_s_e_t
           Each line of output is preceeded by _o_f_f_s_e_t _<_s_p_a_c_e_s_>_s. If the option
           is not specified, the default is zero.  The space taken is in addi-
           tion to the output line width.

     --rr    Write no diagnostic reports on failure to open a file.

     --ss _c_h_a_r
           Separate text columns by the single character _c_h_a_r instead of by
           the appropriate number of _<_s_p_a_c_e_>_s (default for _c_h_a_r is the _<_t_a_b_>
           character).

     --tt    Print neither the five-line identifying header nor the five-line
           trailer usually supplied for each page.  Quit printing after the
           last line of each file without spacing to the end of the page.

     --ww _w_i_d_t_h
           Set the width of the line to _w_i_d_t_h column positions for multiple
           text-column output only.  If the --ww option is not specified and the
           --ss option is not specified, the default width is 72.  If the --ww op-
           tion is not specified and the --ss option is specified, the default
           width is 512.

     _f_i_l_e  A pathname of a file to be printed.  If no _f_i_l_e operands are speci-
           fied, or if a _f_i_l_e operand is `--', the standard input is used.  The
           standard input is used only if no _f_i_l_e operands are specified, or
           if a _f_i_l_e operand is `--'.

     The --ss option does not allow the option letter to be separated from its
     argument, and the options --ee, --ii, and --nn require that both arguments, if
     present, not be separated from the option letter.

EERRRROORRSS

     If pprr receives an interrupt while printing to a terminal, it flushes all
     accumulated error messages to the screen before terminating.

     The pprr utility exits 0 on success, and 1 if an error occurs.

     Error messages are written to standard error during the printing process
     (if output is redirected) or after all successful file printing is com-
     plete (when printing to a terminal).
