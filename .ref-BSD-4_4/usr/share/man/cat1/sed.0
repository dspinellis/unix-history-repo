DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The sseedd utility reads the specified files, or the standard input if no
     files are specified, modifying the input as specified by a list of com-
     mands.  The input is then written to the standard output.

     A single command may be specified as the first argument to sseedd. Multiple
     commands may be specified by using the --ee or --ff options.  All commands
     are applied to the input in the order they are specified regardless of
     their origin.

     The following options are available:

     --aa      The files listed as parameters for the ``w'' functions are creat-
             ed (or truncated) before any processing begins, by default.  The
             --aa option causes sseedd to delay opening each file until a command
             containing the related ``w'' function is applied to a line of in-
             put.

     --ee _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
             Append the editing commands specified by the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d argument to
             the list of commands.

     --ff _c_o_m_m_a_n_d___f_i_l_e
             Append the editing commands found in the file _c_o_m_m_a_n_d___f_i_l_e to the
             list of commands.  The editing commands should each be listed on
             a separate line.

     --nn      By default, each line of input is echoed to the standard output
             after all of the commands have been applied to it.  The --nn option
             suppresses this behavior.

     The form of a sseedd command is as follows:

           [address[,address]]function[arguments]

     Whitespace may be inserted before the first address and the function por-
     tions of the command.

     Normally, sseedd cyclically copies a line of input, not including its termi-
     nating newline character, into a _p_a_t_t_e_r_n _s_p_a_c_e, (unless there is some-
     thing left after a ``D'' function), applies all of the commands with ad-
     dresses that select that pattern space, copies the pattern space to the
     standard output, appending a newline, and deletes the pattern space.

     Some of the functions use a _h_o_l_d _s_p_a_c_e to save all or part of the pattern
     space for subsequent retrieval.

SSeedd AAddddrreesssseess
     An address is not required, but if specified must be a number (that
     counts input lines cumulatively across input files), a dollar (``$'')
     character that addresses the last line of input, or a context address
     (which consists of a regular expression preceded and followed by a delim-
     iter).

     A command line with no addresses selects every pattern space.


     A command line with one address selects all of the pattern spaces that
     match the address.

     A command line with two addresses selects the inclusive range from the
     first pattern space that matches the first address through the next pat-
     tern space that matches the second.  (If the second address is a number
     less than or equal to the line number first selected, only that line is
     selected.)  Starting at the first line following the selected range, sseedd
     starts looking again for the first address.

     Editing commands can be applied to non-selected pattern spaces by use of
     the exclamation character (``!'') function.

SSeedd RReegguullaarr EExxpprreessssiioonnss
     The sseedd regular expressions are basic regular expressions (BRE's, see
     regex(3) for more information).  In addition, sseedd has the following two
     additions to BRE's:

     1.   In a context address, any character other than a backslash (``\'')
          or newline character may be used to delimit the regular expression.
          Also, putting a backslash character before the delimiting character
          causes the character to be treated literally.  For example, in the
          context address \xabc\xdefx, the RE delimiter is an ``x'' and the
          second ``x'' stands for itself, so that the regular expression is
          ``abcxdef''.

     2.   The escape sequence \n matches a newline character embedded in the
          pattern space.  You can't, however, use a literal newline character
          in an address or in the substitute command.

     One special feature of sseedd regular expressions is that they can default
     to the last regular expression used.  If a regular expression is empty,
     i.e. just the delimiter characters are specified, the last regular ex-
     pression encountered is used instead.  The last regular expression is de-
     fined as the last regular expression used as part of an address or sub-
     stitute command, and at run-time, not compile-time.  For example, the
     command ``/abc/s//XXX/'' will substitute ``XXX'' for the pattern ``abc''.

SSeedd FFuunnccttiioonnss
     In the following list of commands, the maximum number of permissible ad-
     dresses for each command is indicated by [0addr], [1addr], or [2addr],
     representing zero, one, or two addresses.

     The argument _t_e_x_t consists of one or more lines.  To embed a newline in
     the text, precede it with a backslash.  Other backslashes in text are
     deleted and the following character taken literally.

     The ``r'' and ``w'' functions take an optional file parameter, which
     should be separated from the function letter by white space.  Each file
     given as an argument to sseedd is created (or its contents truncated) before
     any input processing begins.

     The ``b'', ``r'', ``s'', ``t'', ``w'', ``y'', ``!'', and ``:'' functions
     all accept additional arguments.  The following synopses indicate which
     arguments have to be separated from the function letters by white space
     characters.

     Two of the functions take a function-list.  This is a list of sseedd func-
     tions separated by newlines, as follows:

           { function
             function
             ...
             function
           }

     The ``{'' can be preceded by white space and can be followed by white
     space.  The function can be preceded by white space.  The terminating
     ``}'' must be preceded by a newline an optional white space.

     [2addr] function-list
             Execute function-list only when the pattern space is selected.

     [1addr]a\
     text
             Write _t_e_x_t to standard output immediately before each attempt to
             read a line of input, whether by executing the ``N'' function or
             by beginning a new cycle.

     [2addr]b[lable]
             Branch to the ``:'' function with the specified label.  If the
             label is not specified, branch to the end of the script.

     [2addr]c\
     text
             Delete the pattern space.  With 0 or 1 address or at the end of a
             2-address range, _t_e_x_t is written to the standard output.

     [2addr]d
             Delete the pattern space and start the next cycle.

     [2addr]D
             Delete the initial segment of the pattern space through the first
             newline character and start the next cycle.

     [2addr]g
             Replace the contents of the pattern space with the contents of
             the hold space.

     [2addr]G
             Append a newline character followed by the contents of the hold
             space to the pattern space.

     [2addr]h
             Replace the contents of the hold space with the contents of the
             pattern space.

     [2addr]H
             Append a newline character followed by the contents of the pat-
             tern space to the hold space.

     [1addr]i\
     text
             Write _t_e_x_t to the standard output.

     [2addr]l
             (The letter ell.)  Write the pattern space to the standard output
             in a visually unambiguous form.  This form is as follows:

                   backslash          \
                   alert              \a
                   form-feed          \f
                   newline            \n
                   carriage-return    \r
                   tab                \t
                   vertical tab       \v

             Nonprintable characters are written as three-digit octal numbers
             (with a preceding backslash) for each byte in the character (most
             significant byte first).  Long lines are folded, with the point
             of folding indicated by displaying a backslash followed by a new-
             line.  The end of each line is marked with a ``$''.

     [2addr]n
             Write the pattern space to the standard output if the default
             output has not been suppressed, and replace the pattern space
             with the next line of input.

     [2addr]N
             Append the next line of input to the pattern space, using an em-
             bedded newline character to separate the appended material from
             the original contents.  Note that the current line number
             changes.

     [2addr]p
             Write the pattern space to standard output.

     [2addr]P
             Write the pattern space, up to the first newline character to the
             standard output.

     [1addr]q
             Branch to the end of the script and quit without starting a new
             cycle.

     [1addr]r file
             Copy the contents of _f_i_l_e to the standard output immediately be-
             fore the next attempt to read a line of input.  If _f_i_l_e cannot be
             read for any reason, it is silently ignored and no error condi-
             tion is set.

     [2addr]s/regular expression/replacement/flags
             Substitute the replacement string for the first instance of the
             regular expression in the pattern space.  Any character other
             than backslash or newline can be used instead of a slash to de-
             limit the RE and the replacement.  Within the RE and the replace-
             ment, the RE delimiter itself can be used as a literal character
             if it is preceded by a backslash.

             An ampersand (``&'') appearing in the replacement is replaced by
             the string matching the RE.  The special meaning of ``&'' in this
             context can be suppressed by preceding it by backslash.  The
             string ``\#'', where ``#'' is a digit, is replaced by the text
             matched by the corresponding backreference expression (see
             re_format(7)).

             A line can be split by substituting a newline character into it.
             To specify a newline character in the replacement string, precede
             it with a backslash.

             The value of _f_l_a_g_s in the substitute function is zero or more of
             the following:

                   0 ... 9
                           Make the substitution only for the N'th occurrence
                           of the regular expression in the pattern space.

                   g       Make the substitution for all non-overlapping
                           matches of the regular expression, not just the
                           first one.

                   p       Write the pattern space to standard output if a re-
                           placement was made.  If the replacement string is
                           identical to that which it replaces, it is still
                           considered to have been a replacement.

                   w _f_i_l_e  Append the pattern space to _f_i_l_e if a replacement
                           was made.  If the replacement string is identical
                           to that which it replaces, it is still considered
                           to have been a replacement.

     [2addr]t [label]
             Branch to the ``'': function bearing the label if any substitu-
             tions have been made since the most recent reading of an input
             line or execution of a ``t'' function.  If no label is specified,
             branch to the end of the script.

     [2addr]w _f_i_l_e
             Append the pattern space to the _f_i_l_e.

     [2addr]x
             Swap the contents of the pattern and hold spaces.

     [2addr]y/string1/string2/
             Replace all occurrences of characters in _s_t_r_i_n_g_1 in the pattern
             space with the corresponding characters from _s_t_r_i_n_g_2. Any charac-
             ter other than a backslash or newline can be used instead of a
             slash to delimit the strings.  Within _s_t_r_i_n_g_1 and _s_t_r_i_n_g_2, a
             backslash followed by any character other than a newline is that
             literal character, and a backslash followed by an ``n'' is re-
             placed by a newline character.

     [2addr]!function
     [2addr]!function-list
             Apply the function or function-list only to the lines that are
             _n_o_t selected by the address(es).

     [0addr]:label
             This function does nothing; it bears a label to which the ``b''
             and ``t'' commands may branch.

     [1addr]=
             Write the line number to the standard output followed by a new-
             line character.

     [0addr]
             Empty lines are ignored.

     [0addr]#
             The ``#'' and the remainder of the line are ignored (treated as a
             comment), with the single exception that if the first two charac-
             ters in the file are ``#n'', the default output is suppressed.
             This is the same as specifying the --nn option on the command line.

     The sseedd utility exits 0 on success and >0 if an error occurs.
