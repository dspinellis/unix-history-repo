UUENCODE(1)                  BSD Reference Manual                  UUENCODE(1)

NNAAMMEE
     uuuueennccooddee, uuuuddeeccooddee - encode/decode a binary file

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
     uuuueennccooddee [_f_i_l_e] _n_a_m_e
     uuuuddeeccooddee [_f_i_l_e _._._.]

     UUuueennccooddee and uuuuddeeccooddee are used to transmit binary files over transmission
     mediums that do not support other than simple ASCII data.

     UUuueennccooddee reads _f_i_l_e (or by default the standard input) and writes an en-
     coded version to the standard output.  The encoding uses only printing
     ASCII characters and includes the mode of the file and the operand _n_a_m_e
     for use by uuuuddeeccooddee.

     UUuuddeeccooddee transforms _u_u_e_n_c_o_d_e_d files (or by default, the standard input)
     into the original form.  The resulting file is named _n_a_m_e and will have
     the mode of the original file except that setuid and execute bits are not
     retained.  UUuuddeeccooddee ignores any leading and trailing lines.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
     The following example packages up a source tree, compresses it, uuencodes
     it and mails it to a user on another system.  When uuuuddeeccooddee is run on the
     target system, the file ``src_tree.tar.Z'' will be created which may then
     be uncompressed and extracted into the original tree.

           tar cf - src_tree | compress |
           uuencode src_tree.tar.Z | mail sys1!sys2!user

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
     compress(1),  mail(1),  uucp(1),  uuencode(5),  format(5)

BBUUGGSS
     The encoded form of the file is expanded by 35% (3 bytes become 4 plus
     control information).

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     The uuuueennccooddee command appeared in 4.0BSD.
