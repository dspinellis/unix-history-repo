     ttssoorrtt - topological sort of a directed graph

     TTssoorrtt takes a list of pairs of node names representing directed arcs in a
     graph and prints the nodes in topological order on standard output.  In-
     put is taken from the named _f_i_l_e, or from standard input if no file is
     given.

     Node names in the input are separated by white space and there must be an
     even number of nodes.

     Presence of a node in a graph can be represented by an arc from the node
     to itself.  This is useful when a node is not connected to any other
     nodes.

     If the graph contains a cycle (and therefore cannot be properly sorted),
     one of the arcs in the cycle is ignored and the sort continues.  Cycles
     are reported on standard error.
