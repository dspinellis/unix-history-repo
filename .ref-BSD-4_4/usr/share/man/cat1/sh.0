       Sh is the standard command interpreter for the system.
       The current version of sh is in the process of being
       changed to conform with the POSIX 1003.2 and 1003.2a
       specificiations for the shell.  This version has many fea-
       tures which make it appear similar in some respects to the
       Korn shell, but it is not a Korn shell clone (run GNU's
       bash if you want that).  Only features designated by
       POSIX, plus a few Berkeley extensions, are being incorpo-
       rated into this shell.  We expect POSIX conformance by the
       time 4.4 BSD is released.  This man page is not intended
       to be a tutorial or a complete specification of the shell.

       The shell is a command that reads lines from either a file
       or the terminal, interpretes them, and generally executes
       other commands.  It is the program that is running when a
       user logs into the system (although a user can select a
       different shell with the chsh(1) command).  The shell
       implements a language that has flow control contructs, a
       macro facility that provides a variety of features in
       addition to data storage, along with built in history and
       line editing capabilities.  It incorporates many features
       to aid interactive use and has the advantage that the
       interpretative language is common to both interactive and
       non-interactive use (shell scripts).  That is, commands
       can be typed directly to the running shell or can be put
       into a file and the file can be executed directly by the
       shell.

       If no args are present and if the standard input of the
       shell is connected to a terminal (or if the -i flag is
       set), the shell is considered an interactive shell.  An
       interactive shell generally prompts before each command
       and handles programming and command errors differently (as
       described below).  When first starting, the shell inspects
       argument 0, and if it begins with a dash '-', the shell is
       also considered a login shell.  This is normally done

       automatically by the system when the user first logs in. A
       login shell first reads commands from the files
       /etc/profile and .profile if they exist.  If the environ-
       ment variable ENV is set on entry to a shell, or is set in
       the .profile of a login shell, the shell next reads com-
       mands from the file named in ENV.  Therefore, a user
       should place commands that are to be executed only at
       login time in the .profile file, and commands that are
       executed for every shell inside the ENV file.  To set the
       ENV variable to some file, place the following line in
       your .profile of your home directory

                 ENV=$HOME/.shinit; export ENV

       substituting for ``.shinit'' any filename you wish.  Since
       the ENV file is read for every invocation of the shell,
       including shell scripts and non-interactive shells, the
       following paradigm is useful for restricting commands in
       the ENV file to interactive invocations.  Place commands
       within the ``case'' and ``esac'' below (these commands are
       described later):

            case $- in *i*)
                 # commands for interactive use only
                 ...
            esac

       If command line arguments besides the options have been
       specified, then the shell treats the first argument as the
       name of a file from which to read commands (a shell
       script), and the remaining arguments are set as the posi-
       tional parameters of the shell ($1, $2, etc).  Otherwise,
       the shell reads commands from its standard input.

       All of the single letter options have a corresponding name
       that can be used as an argument to the '-o' option. The
       set -o name is provided next to the single letter option
       in the description below.  Specifying a dash ``-'' turns
       the option on, while using a plus ``+'' disables the
       option.  The following options can be set from the command
       line or with the set(1) builtin (described later).

       -e    errexit
              If not interactive, exit immediatly if any untested
              command fails.  The exit status of a command is
              considered to  be explicitly  tested if the command
              is used to control an if, elif, while, or until; or
              if the command  is  the  left hand operand of an

       -f    noglob
              Disable pathname expansion.

       -n    noexec
              If not interactive, read commands but do not exe-
              cute them.  This is useful for checking the syntax
              of shell scripts.

       -u    nounset
              Write a message to standard error when attempting
              to expand a variable that is not set, and if the
              shell is not interactive, exit immediatly.  (UNIM-

       -v    verbose
              The shell writes its input to standard error as it
              is read.  Useful for debugging.

       -x    xtrace
              Write each command to standard error (preceded by a
              '+ ') before it is executed.  Useful for debugging.

       -I    ignoreeof
              Ignore EOF's from input when interactive.

       -i    interactive
              Force the shell to behave interactively.

       -m    monitor
              Turn on job control (set automatically when inter-
              active).

       -s    stdin
              Read commands from standard input (set automati-
              cally if no file arguments are present).  This
              option has no effect when set after the shell has
              already started running (i.e. with set(1)).

       The shell reads input in terms of lines from a file and
       breaks it up into words at whitespace (blanks and tabs),
       and at certain sequences of characters that are special to
       the shell called ``operators''.  There are two types of
       operators: control operators and redirection operators
       (their meaning is discussed later).  Following is a list
       of operators:

       Control operators: &  &&  (  )  ;  ;; | || <newline>

       Redirection operator:  <  >  >|  <<  >>  <&  >&  <<-  <>



       QQuuoottiinngg


       Quoting is used to remove the special meaning of certain
       characters or words to the shell, such as operators,
       whitespace, or keywords.  There are three types of quot-
       ing: matched single quotes, matched double quotes, and
       backslash.


       BBaacckkssllaasshh


       A backslash preserves the literal meaning of the following
       character, with the exception of <newline>.  A backslash
       preceding a <newline> is treated as a line continuation.

       Enclosing characters in single quotes preserves the lit-
       eral meaning of all the characters.


       DDoouubbllee QQuuootteess


       Enclosing characters within double quotes preserves the
       literal meaning of all characters except dollarsign ($),
       backquote (`), and backslash (\).  The backslash inside
       double quotes is historically weird, and serves to quote
       only the following characters: $  `  "  \  <newline>.
       Otherwise it remains literal.


       RReesseerrvveedd WWoorrddss


       Reserved words are words that have special meaning to the
       shell and are recognized at the beginning of a line and
       after a control operator.  The following are reserved
       words:

          ! elif fi   while     case
          else   for  then {    }
          do     done until     if   esac

       Their meaning is discussed later.


       AAlliiaasseess


       An alias is a name and corresponding value set using the
       alias(1) builtin command.  Whenever a reserved word may
       occur (see above), and after checking for reserved words,
       the shell checks the word to see if it matches an alias.
       If it does, it replaces it in the input stream with its
       value.  For example, if there is an alias called ``lf''
       with the value ``ls -F'', then the input

          lf foobar <return>

            would become

          ls -F foobar <return>


       Aliases provide a convenient way for naive users to create
       shorthands for commands without having to learn how to
       create functions with arguments.  They can also be used to

       create lexically obscure code.  This use is discouraged.


       CCoommmmaannddss


       The shell interpretes the words it reads according to a
       language, the specification of which is outside the scope
       of this man page (refer to the BNF in the POSIX 1003.2
       document).  Essentially though, a line is read and if the
       first word of the line (or after a control operator) is
       not a reserved word, then the shell has recognized a sim-
       ple command.  Otherwise, a complex command or some other
       special construct may have been recognized.


       SSiimmppllee CCoommmmaannddss


       If a simple command has been recognized, the shell per-
       forms the following actions:

       1) Leading words of the form ``name=value'' are stripped
       off and assigned to the environment of the simple command.
       Redirection operators and their arguments (as described
       below) are stripped off and saved for processing.

       2) The remaining words are expanded as described in the
       section called ``Expansions'', and the first remaining
       word is considered the command name and the command is
       located.  The remaining words are considered the arguments
       of the command.  If no command name resulted, then the
       ``name=value'' variable assignments recognized in 1)
       affect the current shell.

       3) Redirections are performed as described in the next
       section.


       RReeddiirreeccttiioonnss


       Redirections are used to change where a command reads its
       input or sends its output.  In general, redirections open,
       close, or duplicate an existing reference to a file.  The
       overall format used for redirection is:

                 [n] redir-op file

       where redir-op is one of the redirection operators men-
       tioned previously.  Following is a list of the possible

       redirections.  The [n] is an optional number, as in '3'
       (not '[3]'), that refers to a file descriptor.

       [n]> file
              Redirect standard output (or n) to file.

       [n]>| file
              Same, but override the -C option.

       [n]>> file
              Append standard output (or n) to file.

       [n]< file
              Redirect standard input (or n) from file.

       [n1]<&n2
              Duplicate standard input (or n1) from file descrip-
              tor n2.

       [n]<&-
              Close standard input (or n).

       [n1]>&n2
              Duplicate standard output (or n) from n2.

       [n]>&-
              Close standard output (or n).

       [n]<> file
              Open file for reading and writing on standard input
              (or n).

       The following redirection is often called a ``here-
       document''.

           [n]<< delimiter
               here-doc-text...
           delimiter

       All the text on successive lines up to the delimiter is
       saved away and made available to the command on standard
       input, or file descriptor n if it is specified.  If the
       delimiter as specified on the initial line is quoted, then
       the here-doc-text is treated literally, otherwise the text
       is subjected to parameter expansion, command substitution,
       and arithmetic expansion (as described in the section on
       ``Expansions''). If the operator is ``<<-'' instead of
       ``<<'', then leading tabs in the here-doc-text are
       stripped.

       There  are  three  types of commands:  shell functions,
       builtin commands, and normal programs -- and the command
       is searched for (by name) in that order.  They each are
       executed in a different way.

       When a shell function is executed, all of the shell  posi-
       tional parameters (except $0, which remains unchanged) are
       set to the arguments of the shell  function.   The  vari-
       ables  which  are  explicitly placed in the environment of
       the command (by placing assignments  to  them  before  the
       function name) are made local to the function and are set
       to the values given. Then the command given in  the  func-
       tion definition  is  executed.   The  positional parame-
       ters are restored to their original values when  the  com-
       mand  completes.

       Shell builtins are executed internally to the shell, with-
       out spawning a new process.

       Otherwise, if the command name doesn't match a function or
       builtin, the command is searched for as a normal program
       in the filesystem (as described in the next section).
       When a normal program is executed, the shell runs the pro-
       gram,  passing  the  arguments and the environment to the
       program. If the program is a shell procedure,  the  shell
       will  interpret the program in a subshell.  The shell will
       reinitialize itself in this case, so that the effect  will
       be  as if a new shell had been invoked to handle the shell
       procedure, except that the location of commands located in
       the  parent shell will be remembered by the child.


       PPaatthh SSeeaarrcchh


       When locating a command, the shell first looks to  see  if
       it  has a shell function by that name.  Then it looks for
       a builtin  command by that name.  Finally, it searches
       each entry in PATH in turn for the command.

       The value of the PATH  variable  should  be  a  series  of
       entries  separated  by  colons.  Each entry consists of a
       directory name.  The current directory may be indicated by
       an empty directory name.

       Command names containing a slash are simply executed with-
       out performing any of the above searches.

       Each command has an exit status that can influence the
       behavior of other shell commands.  The paradigm is that a
       command exits with zero for normal or success, and non-
       zero for failure, error, or a false indication.  The man
       page for each command should indicate the varius exit
       codes and what they mean.  Additionally, the builtin com-
       mands return exit codes, as does an executed function.


       CCoommpplleexx CCoommmmaannddss


       Complex commands are combinations of simple commands with
       control operators or reserved words, together creating a
       larger complex command.  More generally, a command is one
       of the following:

         - simple command

         - pipeline

         - list or compound-list

         - compound command

         - function definition


       Unless otherwise stated, the exit status of a command is
       that of the last simple command executed by the command.


       PPiippeelliinnee


       A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated
       by the control operator |.  The standard output of all but
       the last command is connected to the standard input of the
       next command.

       The format for a pipeline is:

       [!] command1 [ | command2 ...]


       The standard output of command1 is connected to the stan-
       dard input of command2. The standard input, standard out-
       put, or both of a command is considered to be assigned by



4.4BSD                                                          9








SH(1)                  BSD Reference Manual                 SH(1)


       the pipeline before any redirection specified by redirec-
       tion operators that are part of the command.

       If the pipeline is not in the background (discussed
       later), the shell waits for all commands to complete.

       If the reserved word ! does not precede the pipeline, the
       exit status is the exit status of the last command speci-
       fied in the pipeline.  Otherwise, the exit status is the
       logical NOT of the exit status of the last command.  That
       is, if the last command returns zero, the exit status is
       1; if the last command returns greater than zero, the exit
       status is zero.

       Because pipeline assignment of standard input or standard
       output or both takes place before redirection, it can be
       modified by redirection.  For example:

       $ command1 2>&1 | command2

       sends both the standard output and standard error of com-
       mand1 to the standard input of command2.

       A ; or <newline> terminator causes the preceding AND-OR-
       list (described next) to be executed sequentially; a &
       causes asynchronous execution of the preceding AND-OR-
       list.

       If a command is terminated by the control operator amper-
       sand (&), the shell executes the command asynchronously --
       that is, the shell does not wait for the command to finish
       before executing the next command.

       The format for running a command in background is:

       command1 & [command2 & ...]

       If the shell is not interactive, the standard input of an
       asychronous command is set to /dev/null.

       A list is a sequence of zero or more commands separated by
       newlines, semicolons, or ampersands, and optionally termi-
       nated by one of these  three  characters.  The  commands



4.4BSD                                                         10

       in  a list  are executed in the order they are written.
       If command is followed by an ampersand,  the  shell
       starts  the command  and  immediately  proceed  onto the
       next command; otherwise it waits for the  command  to
       terminate  before proceeding to the next one.

       ``&&''  and  ``||'' are AND-OR list operators.  ``&&''
       executes the first command, and then executes  the  second
       command iff  the exit status of the first command is zero.
       ``||'' is similar, but executes the second command iff
       the  exit status of the first command is nonzero.  ``&&''
       and ``||'' both have the same priority.

       The syntax of the if command is

           if list
           then list
           [ elif list
           then    list ] ...
           [ else list ]
           fi

       The syntax of the while command is

           while list
           do   list
           done

       The two lists are executed repeatedly while the exit  sta-
       tus of the first list is zero.  The until command is simi-
       lar, but has the word until in place of while repeats
       until the exit status of the first list is  zero.

       The syntax of the for command is

           for variable in word...
           do   list
           done

       The  words  are  expanded,  and  then the list is executed
       repeatedly with the variable set to each word in turn.  do
       and done may be replaced with ``{'' and ``}''.

       The syntax of the break and continue command is

           break [ num ]
           continue [ num ]

       Break  terminates  the  num  innermost for or while loops.
       Continue continues with the next iteration of  the  inner-
       most loop.  These are implemented as builtin commands.

       The syntax of the case command is

           case word in
           pattern) list ;;
           ...
           esac


       The pattern can actually be one or more patterns (see
       Shell Patterns described later), separated by ``|'' char-
       acters.


       Commands may be grouped by writing either

           (list)

       or

           { list; }

       The first of these executes the commands in a subshell.

       The syntax of a function definition is

           name ( ) command


       A function definition is an  executable  statement;  when
       executed it installs a function named name and returns an
       exit status of zero.   The  command  is  normally  a  list
       enclosed between ``{'' and ``}''.

       Variables  may  be  declared  to be local to a function by
       using a local command.  This should appear  as  the  first
       staement of a function, and the syntax is

           local [ variable | - ] ...

       Local is implemented as a builtin command.

       When  a  variable  is  made local, it inherits the initial
       value and exported and readonly flags  from  the variable
       with  the  same name in the surrounding scope, if there is
       one.  Otherwise, the variable  is  initially  unset.   The
       shell uses  dynamic  scoping, so that if you make the
       variable x local to function f, which then calls function

       changed  via  the  set  command  inside the function to be
       restored to  their  original  values  when  the  function

       It terminates the currently executing function.  Return is

       The shell maintains a set of parameters.  A parameter
       denoted by a name is called a variable. When starting up,
       the shell turns all the environment variables into shell
       variables.  New variables can be set using the form

           name=value


       Variables set by the user must have a name consisting
       solely of alphabetics, numerics, and underscores - the
       first of which must not be numeric.  A parameter can also
       be denoted by a number or a special character as explained
       below.

       is listed next to its character.

       *      Expands to the positional parameters, starting from
              one.  When the expansion occurs within a double-
              quoted string it expands to a single field with the
              value of each parameter separated by the first
              character of the IFS variable, or by a <space> if
              IFS is unset.

       @      Expands to the positional parameters, starting from
              one.  When the expansion occurs within double-
              quotes, each positional parameter expands as a sep-
              arate argument.  If there are no positional parame-
              ters, the expansion of @ generates zero arguments,
              even when @ is double-quoted.  What this basically
              means, for example, is if $1 is ``abc'' and $2 is
              ``def ghi'', then "$@" expands to the two argu-
              ments:

              "abc"   "def ghi"

       #      Expands to the number of positional parameters.

       ?      Expands to the exit status of the most recent
              pipeline.

       - (Hyphen)
              Expands to the current option flags (the single-
              letter option names concatenated into a string) as
              specified on invocation, by the set builtin com-
              mand, or implicitly by the shell.

       $      Expands to the process ID of the invoked shell.  A
              subshell retains the same value of $ as its parent.

       !      Expands to the process ID of the most recent back-
              ground command executed from the current shell.
              For a pipeline, the process ID is that of the last
              command in the pipeline.

       0 (Zero.)
              Expands to the name of the shell or shell script.

       Tilde expansions, parameter expansions, command substitu-
       tions, arithmetic expansions, and quote removals that
       occur within a single word expand to a single field.  It
       is only field splitting or pathname expansion that can
       create multiple fields from a single word. The single
       exception to this rule is the expansion of the special
       parameter @ within double-quotes, as was described above.

       The order of word expansion is:

       (1)  Tilde Expansion, Parameter Expansion, Command Substi-
       tution, Arithmetic Expansion (these all occur at the same
       time).

       (2)  Field Splitting is performed on fields generated by
       step (1) unless the IFS variable is null.

       (3)  Pathname Expansion (unless set -f is in effect).

       (4)  Quote Removal.

       The $ character is used to introduce parameter expansion,
       command substitution, or arithmetic evaluation.

       A word beginning with an unquoted tilde character (~) is
       subjected to tilde expansion.  All the characters up to a
       slash (/) or the end of the word are treated as a username
       and are replaced with the users home directory.  If the
       username is missing (as in ~/foobar), the tilde is

       The simplest form for parameter expansion is:

           ${parameter}

       The value, if any, of parameter is substituted.

       The parameter name or symbol can be enclosed in braces,
       which are optional except for positional parameters with
       more than one digit or when parameter is followed by a
       character that could be interpreted as part of the name.
       If a parameter expansion occurs inside double-quotes:

       1) Pathname expansion is not performed on the results of
       the expansion.

       2) Field splitting is not performed on the results of the
       expansion, with the exception of @.

       In addition, a parameter expansion can be modified by
       using one of the following formats.


       ${parameter:-word}
              Use Default Values.  If parameter is unset or null,
              the expansion of word is substituted; otherwise,
              the value of parameter is substituted.

       ${parameter:=word}
              Assign Default Values.  If parameter is unset or
              null, the expansion of word is assigned to parame-
              ter.  In all cases, the final value of parameter is
              substituted.  Only variables, not positional param-
              eters or special parameters, can be assigned in
              this way.

       ${parameter:?[word]}
              Indicate Error if Null or Unset.  If parameter is
              unset or null, the expansion of word (or a message
              indicating it is unset if word is omitted) is writ-
              ten to standard error and the shell exits with a
              nonzero exit status.  Otherwise, the value of
              parameter is substituted.  An interactive shell
              need not exit.

       ${parameter:+word}
              Use Alternate Value.  If parameter is unset or
              null, null is substituted; otherwise, the expansion
              of word is substituted.

       In the parameter expansions shown previously, use of the
       colon in the format results in a test for a parameter that

       is unset or null; omission of the colon results in a test
       for a parameter that is only unset.

       ${#parameter}
              String Length.  The length in characters of the
              value of parameter.

       The following four varieties of parameter expansion pro-
       vide for substring processing.  In each case, pattern
       matching notation (see Shell Patterns), rather than regu-
       lar expression notation, is used to evaluate the patterns.
       If parameter is * or @, the result of the expansion is
       unspecified.  Enclosing the full parameter expansion
       string in double-quotes does not cause the following four
       varieties of pattern characters to be quoted, whereas
       quoting characters within the braces has this effect.
       (UNIMPLEMENTED IN 4.4alpha)

       ${parameter%word}
              Remove Smallest Suffix Pattern.  The word is
              expanded to produce a pattern.  The parameter
              expansion then results in parameter, with the
              smallest portion of the suffix matched by the pat-
              tern deleted.


       ${parameter%%word}
              Remove Largest Suffix Pattern.  The word is
              expanded to produce a pattern.  The parameter
              expansion then results in parameter, with the

       Command substitution allows the output of a command to be
       substituted in place of the command name itself.  Command
       substitution occurs when the command is enclosed as fol-
       lows:

              $(command)

       or (``backquoted'' version):

              `command`


       The shell expands the command substitution by executing
       command in a subshell environment and replacing the com-
       mand substitution with the standard output of the command,
       removing sequences of one or more <newline>s at the end of
       the substitution.  (Embedded <newline>s before the end of
       the output are not removed; however, during field split-
       ting, they may be translated into <space>s, depending on
       the value of IFS and quoting that is in effect.)

       Arithmetic expansion provides a mechanism for evaluating
       an arithmetic expression and substituting its value. The
       format for arithmetic expansion is as follows:

              $((expression))

       The expression is treated as if it were in double-quotes,
       except that a double-quote inside the expression is not
       treated specially.  The shell expands all tokens in the
       expression for parameter expansion, command substitution,
       and quote removal.

       Next, the shell treats this as an arithmetic expression
       and substitutes the value of the expression.

       After parameter expansion, command substitution, and
       arithmetic expansion the shell scans the results of expan-
       sions and substitutions that did not occur in double-
       quotes for field splitting and multiple fields can result.

       Unless the -f flag is set, file name  generation is  per-
       formed  after  word  splitting  is complete.  Each word is
       viewed as a series of patterns, separated by slashes.  The
       process  of  expansion replaces the word with the names of
       all existing files whose names can be formed by  replacing
       each pattern with a string that matches the specified pat-
       tern.  There are two restrictions on this:  first, a  pat-
       tern cannot match a string containing a slash, and second,
       a pattern cannot match a string  starting  with  a  period
       unless the first character of the pattern is a period.
       The next section describes the patterns used for both
       Pathname Expansion and the case(1) command.

       A pattern consists of normal characters, which match them-
       selves,  and  meta-characters.   The  meta-characters  are
       ``!'', ``*'', ``?'', and ``[''.  These   characters  lose
       there  special  meanings if they are quoted.  When command
       or variable substitution is performed and the dollar  sign
       or  back quotes  are  not double quoted, the value of the
       variable or the output of the command is scanned for these
       characters and they are turned into meta-characters.

       An asterisk (``*'') matches any string of  characters.   A
       question mark  matches   any  single  character. A  left
       bracket (``['') introduces a character class.  The end  of
       the  character class is indicated by a ``]''; if the ``]''
       is missing then the ``[''  matches  a  ``[''  rather  than
       introducing  a character class.  A character class matches
       any of the characters  between  the  square  brackets.   A
       range  of  characters may be specified using a minus sign.
       The character class  may be  complemented  by  making  an
       exclamation  point  the  first  character of the character
       class.

       To include a ``]'' in a character class, make it the first
       character  listed (after the ``!'', if any).  To include a

       be performed by a separate process. In addition to these,
       there are several  other  commands that may be builtin for
       efficiency (e.g. printf(1), echo(1), test(1), etc).

       alias  [ name[=string] ...  ]
              If name=string is specified, the shell defines the
              alias ``name'' with value ``string''.  If just
              ``name'' is specified, the value of the alias
              ``name'' is printed.  With no arguments, the alias
              builtin prints the names and values of all defined
              aliases (see unalias).

       bg [ job ] ...
              Continue the specified jobs (or the current job if
              no jobs  are  given) in the background.

       command command arg...
              Execute the specified builtin command.  (This is
              useful when you have a shell function with the same
              name as a builtin command.)

       cd [ directory ]
              Switch to the specified  directory  (default
              $HOME).  If the an entry for CDPATH appears in the
              environment of the cd command or the shell variable
              CDPATH is set and the  directory name does not
              begin with a slash, then  the  directories  listed
              in  CDPATH  will   be searched  for the specified
              directory.  The format of CDPATH is the same as
              that of PATH. In  an  interactive shell, the cd
              command will print out the name of the directory
              that it actually switched to if this is different
              from  the  name that the user gave.  These may be
              different either because the CDPATH  mechanism was
              used or because a symbolic link was crossed.

       . file The commands in the specified file are read and
              executed by the shell.

       eval string...
              Concatenate all the arguments with spaces.  Then
              re-parse and execute the command.

       exec [ command arg...  ]
              Unless command  is  omitted,  the  shell  process
              is replaced  with the specified program (which must

              be a real program, not a shell builtin or func-
              tion).   Any redirections on the exec command are
              marked as permanent, so that they are not undone
              when the exec  command finishes.

       exit [ exitstatus ]
              Terminate the shell process.  If exitstatus is
              given it is used as the exit status of the shell;
              otherwise the exit status of the preceding command
              is used.

       export name...
              The specified names are exported so that  they
              will appear  in  the  environment  of subsequent
              commands.  The only way to un-export a variable is
              to unset  it.  The shell allows  the value of a
              variable to be set at the same time it is exported
              by writing

                  export name=value

              With no arguments the export command lists the
              names of all exported variables.

       fc  [-e editor] [first [last]]

       fc  -l [-nr] [first [last]]

       fc  -s [old=new] [first]
              The fc builtin lists, or edits and re-executes,
              commands previously entered to an interactive
              shell.

            -e editor
              Use the editor named by editor to edit the com-
              mands.  The editor string is a command name, sub-
              ject to search via the PATH variable.  The value in
              the FCEDIT variable is used as a default when -e is
              not specified.  If FCEDIT is null or unset, the
              value of the EDITOR variable is used.  If EDITOR is
              null or unset, ed(1) is used as the editor.

            -l (ell)
              List the commands rather than invoking an editor on
              them.  The commands are written in the sequence
              indicated by the first and last operands, as
              affected by -r, with each command preceded by the
              command number.

            -n
              Suppress command numbers when listing with -l.

            -r
              Reverse the order of the commands listed (with -l)
              or edited (with neither -l nor -s).

            -s
              Re-execute the command without invoking an editor.

            first

            last
              Select the commands to list or edit.  The number of
              previous commands that can be accessed are deter-
              mined by the value of the HISTSIZE variable.  The
              value of first or last or both are one of the fol-
              lowing:

            [+]number
              A positive number representing a command number;
              command numbers can be displayed with the -l
              option.

            -number
              A negative decimal number representing the command
              that was executed number of commands previously.
              For example, -1 is the immediately previous com-
              mand.

            string
              A string indicating the most recently entered com-
              mand that begins with that string.  If the old=new
              operand is not also specified with -s, the string
              form of the first operand cannot contain an embed-
              ded equal sign.

            The following environment variables affect the
              execution of fc:

            FCEDIT
              Name of the editor to use.

            HISTSIZE
              The number of previous ocmmands that are access-
              able.

       fg [ job ]
              Move  the  specified  job  or  the current job to
              the foreground.

       getopts optstring var
              The POSIX getopts command.

       hash -rv command...
              The shell maintains a hash table which remembers
              the locations of commands.  With no arguments what-
              soever, the hash  command   prints  out  the con-
              tents of this table.  Entries which have not been
              looked  at  since the last  cd command are marked
              with an asterisk; it is possible for these entries
              to be invalid.

              With arguments, the hash command removes  the
              specified  commands  from  the hash table (unless
              they are functions)  and  then  locates  them.
              With  the  -v option,  hash prints the locations of
              the commands as it finds them.  The -r option
              causes the hash command to  delete  all  the
              entries in the hash table except for functions.

       jobid [ job ]
              Print the process id's of the processes in  the
              job.  If  the job argument is omitted, use the cur-
              rent job.

       jobs   This command lists out all the  background  pro-
              cesses which are children of the current shell pro-
              cess.

       pwd    Print the current directory.  The builtin command
              may differ  from the program of the same name
              because the builtin command remembers what the cur-
              rent  directory is  rather than recomputing it each
              time.  This makes it faster.  However,  if  the
              current  directory  is renamed,  the builtin ver-
              sion of pwd will continue to print the old name for
              the directory.

       read [ -p prompt ] [ -e ] variable...
              The prompt is printed if the -p option  is  speci-
              fied and the standard input is a terminal.  Then a
              line is read from the standard input.  The  trail-
              ing  newline is  deleted from  the  line and the
              line is split as described in the section on word
              splitting above, and the pieces  are  assigned to
              the variables in order.  If there are more pieces
              than variables, the  remaining pieces  (along  with
              the characters in IFS that separated them) are
              assigned to  the  last  variable.  If  there are
              more variables than pieces, the remaining variables
              are assigned the null string.

              The -e option causes any backslashes in the input
              to be  treated specially.  If a backslash is

              followed by a newline, the backslash  and  the
              newline will  be deleted.   If  a  backslash is
              followed by any other character, the backslash will
              be deleted and the following  character  will  be
              treated as though it were not in IFS, even if it
              is.

       readonly name...
              The specified names are marked as read only, so
              that they  cannot  be subsequently modified or
              unset.  The shell allows the value of a variable to
              be set at the  same time it is marked read only by
              writing

       readonly name=value
              With  no  arguments the  readonly   command lists
              the names of all read only variables.

       set [ { -options | +options | -- } ] arg...
              The set command performs three different functions.

              With no arguments, it lists the values of  all
              shell variables.

              If  options are  given, it sets the specified
              option flags, or clears them as described in the
              section called ``Argument List Processing''.

              The third use of the set command is to set the val-
              ues of the shell's positional parameters to the
              specified args.   To  change  the positional param-
              eters without changing any options, use ``--'' as
              the  first  argument to set.  If no args are pre-
              sent, the set command will clear all the positional
              parameters (equivalent to executing ``shift $#''.

       setvar variable value
              Assigns  value to variable. (In general it is bet-
              ter to write variable=value  rather  than  using
              setvar.  Setvar  is  intended  to  be  used  in
              functions that assign values to variables whose
              names are passed  as parameters.)

       shift [ n ]
              Shift  the  positional  parameters  n times.  A
              shift sets the value of $1 to the value of $2, the
              value of $2  to  the value   of  $3, and so on,
              decreasing the value of $# by one. If  there  are
              zero  positional parameters, shifting doesn't do
              anything.

       trap [ action ] signal...
              Cause  the shell to parse and execute action when
              any of the specified signals are received.   The
              signals are specified  by signal number.  Action
              may be null or omitted; the former causes the spec-
              ified signal to be  ignored and the latter causes
              the default action to be taken.  When the shell
              forks off a subshell, it resets  trapped  (but  not
              ignored)  signals  to the default action.  The trap
              command has  no  effect  on signals that were
              ignored on entry to the shell.

       umask [ mask ]
              Set the  value of umask (see umask(2)) to the spec-
              ified octal value.  If the argument  is  omitted,
              the umask value is printed.

       unalias [-a] [name]
              If ``name'' is specified, the shell removes that
              alias.  If ``-a'' is specified, all aliases are
              removed.

       unset name...
              The specified  variables and functions are unset
              and unexported. If a given name corresponds  to
              both   a variable  and  a  function, both the vari-
              able and the function are unset.

       wait [ job ]
              Wait for the specified job to complete and return
              the exit  status  of the last process in the job.
              If the argument is omitted, wait for all  jobs  to
              complete and the return an exit status of zero.

       When sh is being used interactively from a terminal, the
       current command and the command history (see fc in
       Builtins) can be edited using vi-mode command-line edit-
       ing.  This mode uses commands, described below, similar to
       a subset of those described in the vi man page.  The com-
       mand set -o vi enables vi-mode editing and place sh into
       vi insert mode.  With vi-mode enabled, sh can be switched
       between insert mode and command mode.  The editor is not
       described in full here, but will be in a later document.
       It's similar to vi: typing <ESC> will throw you into com-
       mand VI command mode.  Hitting <return> while in command
       mode will pass the line to the shell.
