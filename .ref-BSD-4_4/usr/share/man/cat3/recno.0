       The  routine  _d_b_o_p_e_n  is the library interface to database
       files.  One of the supported file formats is record number
       files.   The  general  description  of the database access
       methods is in _d_b_o_p_e_n(3), this manual page  describes  only
       the recno specific information.

       The  record  number  data  structure is either variable or
       fixed-length  records  stored  in  a   flat-file   format,
       accessed  by  the logical record number.  The existence of
       record number five implies the existence  of  records  one
       through four, and the deletion of record number one causes
       record number five to be renumbered to record number four,
       as  well  as the cursor, if positioned after record number
       one, to shift down one record.

       The recno access method specific data  structure  provided
       to  _d_b_o_p_e_n  is  defined in the <db.h> include file as fol-
       lows:

       typedef struct {
              u_long flags;
              u_int cachesize;
              int psize;
              int lorder;
              size_t reclen;
              u_char bval;
              char *bfname;
       } RECNOINFO;

       The elements of this structure are defined as follows:

       bval   The delimiting byte to be used to mark the end of a
              record  for  variable-length  records,  and the pad
              character for fixed-length records.  If no value is
              specified,  newlines  (``\n'') are used to mark the
              end of  variable-length  records  and  fixed-length
              records are padded with spaces.

       cachesize
              A  suggested  maximum size, in bytes, of the memory
              cache.  This value is oonnllyy advisory, and the access
              method  will allocate more memory rather than fail.
              If _c_a_c_h_e_s_i_z_e is  0 (no size is specified) a default

              cache is used.

       psize  The recno access method stores the in-memory copies
              of its records in a btree.  This value is the  size
              (in  bytes)  of  the  pages  used for nodes in that
              tree.  If _p_s_i_z_e is 0 (no page size is specified)  a
              page  size  is  chosen based on the underlying file
              system I/O  block  size.   See  _b_t_r_e_e(3)  for  more
              information.

       bfname The recno access method stores the in-memory copies
              of its records in a btree.  If bfname is  non-NULL,
              it  specifies  the  name  of  the btree file, as if
              specified as the file name for a dbopen of a  btree
              file.

       flags  The  flag  value  is specified by _o_r'ing any of the
              following values:

              R_FIXEDLEN
                     The  records  are  fixed-length,  not   byte
                     delimited.   The  structure  element  _r_e_c_l_e_n
                     specifies the length of the record, and  the
                     structure  element  _b_v_a_l  is used as the pad
                     character.

              R_NOKEY
                     In the interface specified  by  _d_b_o_p_e_n,  the
                     sequential  record  retrieval  fills in both
                     the caller's key and  data  structures.   If
                     the  R_NOKEY  flag  is specified, the _c_u_r_s_o_r
                     routines are not required to fill in the key
                     structure.   This  permits  applications  to
                     retrieve records at the end of files without
                     reading all of the intervening records.

              R_SNAPSHOT
                     This  flag  requires  that a snapshot of the
                     file be taken when _d_b_o_p_e_n is called, instead
                     of  permitting  any unmodified records to be
                     read from the original file.

       lorder The byte order for integers in the stored  database
              metadata.  The number should represent the order as
              an integer; for example, big endian order would  be
              the  number  4,321.   If  _l_o_r_d_e_r  is 0 (no order is
              specified) the current host order is used.

       reclen The length of a fixed-length record.

       The data part of the  key/data  pair  used  by  the  recno

       access  method  is  the same as other access methods.  The
       key is different.  The _d_a_t_a field of the key should  be  a
       pointer  to  a memory location of type _r_e_c_n_o___t, as defined
       in the <db.h> include file.  This  type  is  normally  the
       largest  unsigned integral type available to the implemen-
       tation.  The _s_i_z_e field of the key should be the  size  of
       that type.

       In the interface specified by _d_b_o_p_e_n, using the _p_u_t inter-
       face to create a new record will  cause  the  creation  of
       multiple,  empty records if the record number is more than
       one greater than  the  largest  record  currently  in  the
       database.
