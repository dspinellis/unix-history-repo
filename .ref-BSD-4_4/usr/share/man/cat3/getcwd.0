     ggeettwwdd - get working directory pathname

     The ggeettccwwdd() function copies the absolute pathname of the current working
     directory into the memory referenced by _b_u_f and returns a pointer to _b_u_f.
     The _s_i_z_e argument is the size, in bytes, of the array referenced by _b_u_f.

     If _b_u_f is NULL, space is allocated as necessary to store the pathname.
     This space may later be free(3)'d.

     The function ggeettwwdd() is a compatibility routine which calls ggeettccwwdd() with
     its _b_u_f argument and a size of MAXPATHLEN (as defined in the include file
     <_s_y_s_/_p_a_r_a_m_._h>). Obviously, _b_u_f should be at least MAXPATHLEN bytes in
     length.

     These routines have traditionally been used by programs to save the name
     of a working directory for the purpose of returning to it.  A much faster
     and less error-prone method of accomplishing this is to open the current
     directory (`.') and use the fchdir(2) function to return.

     Upon successful completion, a pointer to the pathname is returned.  Oth-
     erwise a NULL pointer is returned and the global variable _e_r_r_n_o is set to
     indicate the error.  In addition, ggeettwwdd() copies the error message asso-
     ciated with _e_r_r_n_o into the memory referenced by _b_u_f.

     The ggeettccwwdd() function will fail if:

     [EACCESS]  Read or search permission was denied for a component of the
                pathname.

     [EINVAL]   The _s_i_z_e argument is zero.

     [ENOENT]   A component of the pathname no longer exists.

     [ENOMEM]   Insufficient memory is available.

     [ERANGE]   The _s_i_z_e argument is greater than zero but smaller than the
                length of the pathname plus 1.

     The ggeettccwwdd() function conforms to ANSI C X3.159-1989 (``ANSI C ''). The
     ability to specify a NULL pointer and have ggeettccwwdd() allocate memory as
     necessary is an extension.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     The ggeettwwdd() function appeared in 4.0BSD.

BBUUGGSS
     The ggeettwwdd() function does not do sufficient error checking and is not
     able to return very long, but valid, paths.  It is provided for compati-
     bility.
