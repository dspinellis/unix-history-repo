       The  routine  _d_b_o_p_e_n  is the library interface to database
       files.  One of the supported file formats is  hash  files.
       The  general description of the database access methods is
       in _d_b_o_p_e_n(3), this manual page  describes  only  the  hash
       specific information.

       The  hash data structure is an extensible, dynamic hashing
       scheme.

       The access method  specific  data  structure  provided  to
       _d_b_o_p_e_n is defined in the <db.h> include file as follows:

       typedef struct {
              int bsize;
              int ffactor;
              int nelem;
              int cachesize;
              u_long (*hash)(const void *, size_t);
              int lorder;
       } HASHINFO;

       The elements of this structure are as follows:

       bsize  _B_s_i_z_e  defines  the hash table bucket size, and is,
              by default, 256 bytes.  It  may  be  preferable  to
              increase the page size for disk-resident tables and
              tables with large data items.

       cachesize
              A suggested maximum size, in bytes, of  the  memory
              cache.  This value is oonnllyy advisory, and the access
              method will allocate more memory rather than  fail.

       ffactor
              _F_f_a_c_t_o_r indicates a desired density within the hash
              table.  It is an approximation  of  the  number  of
              keys  allowed  to  accumulate  in  any  one bucket,
              determining when the hash table grows  or  shrinks.
              The default value is 8.

       hash   _H_a_s_h  is  a  user  defined hash function.  Since no
              hash function performs equally well on all possible
              data,  the  user  may  find  that the built-in hash

              function does poorly  on  a  particular  data  set.
              User  specified  hash functions must take two argu-
              ments (a pointer to a byte string and a length) and
              return an u_long to be used as the hash value.

       lorder The  byte order for integers in the stored database
              metadata.  The number should represent the order as
              an  integer; for example, big endian order would be
              the number 4,321.  If _l_o_r_d_e_r  is  0  (no  order  is
              specified)  the current host order is used.  If the
              file already exists, the specified value is ignored
              and  the  value specified when the tree was created
              is used.

       nelem  _N_e_l_e_m is an estimate of the final size of the  hash
              table.  If not set or set too low, hash tables will
              expand gracefully as keys are entered,  although  a
              slight performance degradation may be noticed.  The
              default value is 1.

       If the file already exists (and the O_TRUNC  flag  is  not
       specified), the values specified for the parameters bsize,
       ffactor, lorder and nelem are ignored and the values spec-
       ified when the tree was created are used.

       If a hash function is specified, _h_a_s_h___o_p_e_n will attempt to
       determine if the hash function specified is  the  same  as
       the one with which the database was created, and will fail
       if it is not.

       Backward compatible interfaces to the  routines  described
       in _d_b_m(3), and _n_d_b_m(3) are provided, however, these inter-
       faces are not compatible with previous file formats.
