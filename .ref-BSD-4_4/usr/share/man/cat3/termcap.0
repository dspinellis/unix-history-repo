     These functions extract and use capabilities from a terminal capability
     data base, usually _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_m_i_s_c_/_t_e_r_m_c_a_p, the format of which is de-
     scribed in termcap(5).  These are low level routines; see curses(3) for a
     higher level package.

     The ttggeetteenntt() function extracts the entry for terminal _n_a_m_e into the
     buffer at _b_p. The _b_p argument should be a character buffer of size 1024
     and must be retained through all subsequent calls to ttggeettnnuumm(),
     ttggeettffllaagg(), and ttggeettssttrr().  The ttggeetteenntt() function returns -1 if none of
     the tteerrmmccaapp data base files could be opened, 0 if the terminal name given
     does not have an entry, and 1 if all goes well.  It will look in the en-
     vironment for a TERMCAP variable.  If found, and the value does not begin
     with a slash, and the terminal type _n_a_m_e is the same as the environment
     string TERM, the TERMCAP string is used instead of reading a tteerrmmccaapp
     file.  If it does begin with a slash, the string is used as a path name
     of the tteerrmmccaapp file to search.  If TERMCAP does not begin with a slash
     and _n_a_m_e is different from TERM, ttggeetteenntt() searches the files
     _$_H_O_M_E_/_._t_e_r_m_c_a_p and _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_m_i_s_c_/_t_e_r_m_c_a_p, in that order, unless the en-
     vironment variable TERMPATH exists, in which case it specifies a list of
     file pathnames (separated by spaces or colons) to be searched instead.
     Whenever multiple files are searched and a ttcc field occurs in the re-
     quested entry, the entry it names must be found in the same file or one
     of the succeeding files.  This can speed up entry into programs that call
     ttggeetteenntt(), as well as help debug new terminal descriptions or make one
     for your terminal if you can't write the file _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_m_i_s_c_/_t_e_r_m_c_a_p.

     The ttggeettnnuumm() function gets the numeric value of capability _i_d, returning
     -1 if is not given for the terminal.  The ttggeettffllaagg() function returns 1
     if the specified capability is present in the terminal's entry, 0 if it
     is not.  The ttggeettssttrr() function returns the string value of the capabili-
     ty _i_d, places it in the buffer at _a_r_e_a, and advances the _a_r_e_a pointer.
     It decodes the abbreviations for this field described in termcap(5),  ex-
     cept for cursor addressing and padding information.  The ttggeettssttrr() func-
     tion returns NULL if the capability was not found.

     The ttggoottoo() function returns a cursor addressing string decoded from _c_m
     to go to column _d_e_s_t_c_o_l in line _d_e_s_t_l_i_n_e. It uses the external variables
     _U_P (from the uupp capability) and _B_C (if bbcc is given rather than bbss) if
     necessary to avoid placing \\nn, ^^DD or ^^@@ in the returned string.  (Pro-
     grams which call ttggoottoo() should be sure to turn off the XTABS bit(s),
     since ttggoottoo() may now output a tab.  Note that programs using termcap
     should in general turn off XTABS anyway since some terminals use control-
     I for other functions, such as nondestructive space.)  If a %% sequence is
     given which is not understood, then ttggoottoo() returns (OOPS).

     The ttppuuttss() function decodes the leading padding information of the
     string _c_p; _a_f_f_c_n_t gives the number of lines affected by the operation, or
     1 if this is not applicable, _o_u_t_c is a routine which is called with each
     character in turn.  The external variable _o_s_p_e_e_d should contain the out-
     put speed of the terminal as encoded by stty(3).  The external variable
     _P_C should contain a pad character to be used (from the capability) if a
     null (^^@@) is inappropriate.
