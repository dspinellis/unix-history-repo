     iinnttrroo - introduction to the C libraries

     This section provides an overview of the C library functions, their error
     returns and other common definitions and concepts.  Most of these func-
     tions are available from the C library, _l_i_b_c (see libc(3)).  Other li-
     braries, such as the math library, _l_i_b_m, must be indicated at compile
     time with the --ll option of the compiler.

     A subset of the libc(functions) are available from Fortran; they are de-
     scribed separately in intro(3f).

     The various libraries (followed by the loader flag):

     libc(--ll_c)   Standard C library functions. (See libc(3).) When using the C
                 compiler  cc(1),  it is not necessary to supply the loader
                 flag --ll_c for these functions.  There are several `libraries'
                 or groups of functions included inside of libc: the standard
                 I/O routines, database routines, bit operators, string opera-
                 tors, character tests and character operators, des encryption
                 routines, storage allocation, time functions, signal handling
                 and more.

     libcurses( --ll_c_u_r_s_e_s --ll_t_e_r_m_c_a_p)
                 Terminal independent screen management routines for two di-
                 mensional non-bitmap display terminals.  (See curses(3).)

     libcompat(--ll_c_o_m_p_a_t)
                 Functions which are obsolete but are available for compati-
                 bility with 4.3BSD. In particular, a number of system call
                 interfaces provided in previous releases of BSD have been in-
                 cluded for source code compatibility.  Use of these routines
                 should, for the most part, be avoided.  The manual page entry
                 for each compatibility routine indicates the proper interface
                 to use.

     libl(--ll_l)   The library for lex(1).

     libm(--ll_m)   The math library, _l_i_b_m. The math library is loaded as needed
                 by the Pascal compiler pc(1),  but not by the C compiler
                 which requires the --ll_m flag.  (See math(3).)

     libmp(--ll_m_p)

     libplot(--ll_p_l_o_t)
                 Device independent plotting functions.  (See plot(3).)

     libplotf77(--ll_p_l_o_t_f_7_7)
                 The device independent plotting functions for fortran.  (See
                 plot(3).)

     libtermcap--ll_t_e_r_m_c_a_p
                 The terminal independent operation library package. (See
                 termcap(3).)

     liby(--ll_y)   The library for yacc(1).
