       The  routine  _d_b_o_p_e_n  is the library interface to database
       files.  One of the supported file formats is btree  files.
       The  general description of the database access methods is
       in _d_b_o_p_e_n(3), this manual page describes  only  the  btree
       specific information.

       The btree data structure is a sorted, balanced tree struc-
       ture storing associated key/data pairs.

       The btree access method specific data  structure  provided
       to  _d_b_o_p_e_n  is  defined in the <db.h> include file as fol-
       lows:

       typedef struct {
              u_long flags;
              u_int cachesize;
              int maxkeypage;
              int minkeypage;
              int psize;
              int (*compare)(const DBT *key1, const DBT *key2);
              int (*prefix)(const DBT *key1, const DBT *key2);
              int lorder;
       } BTREEINFO;

       The elements of this structure are as follows:

       flags  The flag value is specified by _o_r'ing  any  of  the
              following values:

              R_DUP  Permit duplicate keys in the tree, i.e. per-
                     mit insertion if  the  key  to  be  inserted
                     already  exists  in  the  tree.  The default
                     behavior, as described in _d_b_o_p_e_n(3),  is  to
                     overwrite  a  matching  key when inserting a
                     new key or to fail if the R_NOOVERWRITE flag
                     is  specified.  The R_DUP flag is overridden
                     by  the  R_NOOVERWRITE  flag,  and  if   the
                     R_NOOVERWRITE flag is specified, attempts to
                     insert duplicate keys  into  the  tree  will
                     fail.

                     If the database contains duplicate keys, the
                     order of  retrieval  of  key/data  pairs  is

                     undefined  if  the _g_e_t routine is used, how-
                     ever, _s_e_q routine calls  with  the  R_CURSOR
                     flag  set  will  always  return  the logical
                     ``first'' of any group of duplicate keys.

       cachesize
              A suggested maximum size (in bytes) of  the  memory
              cache.  This value is oonnllyy advisory, and the access
              method will allocate more memory rather than  fail.
              Since  every  search  examines the root page of the
              tree, caching the most recently used pages substan-
              tially improves access time.  In addition, physical
              writes are delayed as long as possible, so a moder-
              ate  cache  can reduce the number of I/O operations
              significantly.  Obviously, using a cache  increases
              (but  only  increases) the likelihood of corruption
              or lost data if the system crashes while a tree  is
              being  modified.   If  _c_a_c_h_e_s_i_z_e  is  0 (no size is
              specified) a default cache is used.

       psize  Page size is the size (in bytes) of the pages  used
              for  nodes  in  the tree.  The minimum page size is
              512 bytes and the maximum page  size  is  64K.   If
              _p_s_i_z_e  is 0 (no page size is specified) a page size
              is chosen based on the underlying file  system  I/O
              block size.

       lorder The  byte order for integers in the stored database
              metadata.  The number should represent the order as
              an  integer; for example, big endian order would be
              the number 4,321.  If _l_o_r_d_e_r  is  0  (no  order  is
              specified) the current host order is used.

       maxkeypage
              Not currently used.

       minkeypage
              The  minimum number of keys which will be stored on
              any single page.  This value is used  to  determine
              which  keys  will be stored on overflow pages, i.e.
              if a key or data item is longer than  the  pagesize
              divided  by the minkeypage value, it will be stored
              on overflow pages instead of in  the  page  itself.
              If  _m_i_n_k_e_y_p_a_g_e  is  0 (no minimum number of keys is
              specified) a value of 2 is used.

       compare
              Compare is the key comparison  function.   It  must
              return  an  integer less than, equal to, or greater
              than zero if the first key argument  is  considered
              to  be respectively less than, equal to, or greater

              than the second key argument.  The same  comparison
              function must be used on a given tree every time it
              is opened.  If _c_o_m_p_a_r_e is NULL (no comparison func-
              tion  is  specified),  the  keys are compared lexi-
              cally,  with  shorter  keys  considered  less  than
              longer keys.

       prefix Prefix is the prefix comparison function.  If spec-
              ified, this routine must return the number of bytes
              of  the  second key argument which are necessary to
              determine that it is greater  than  the  first  key
              argument.   If  the  keys are equal, the key length
              should be returned.  Note, the usefulness  of  this
              routine  is  very data dependent, but, in some data
              sets can produce significantly reduced  tree  sizes
              and  search  times.   If  _p_r_e_f_i_x is NULL (no prefix
              function is specified), aanndd no comparison  function
              is  specified, a default lexical comparison routine
              is used.  If _p_r_e_f_i_x is NULL and a  comparison  rou-
              tine is specified, no prefix comparison is done.

       If  the  file  already exists (and the O_TRUNC flag is not
       specified), the values specified for the parameters flags,
       lorder  and  psize are ignored in favor of the values used
       when the tree was created.

       Forward sequential scans of a tree are from the least  key
       to the greatest.

       Space freed up by deleting key/data pairs from the tree is
       never reclaimed, although it is  normally  made  available
       for reuse.  This means that the btree storage structure is
       grow-only.  The only  solutions  are  to  avoid  excessive
       deletions,  or  to create a fresh tree periodically from a
       scan of an existing one.

       Searches, insertions, and deletions in a  btree  will  all
       complete  in  O  lg  base N where base is the average fill
       factor.  Often, inserting ordered data into btrees results
       in  a low fill factor.  This implementation has been modi-
       fied to make ordered insertion the best case, resulting in
       a much better than normal page fill factor.
