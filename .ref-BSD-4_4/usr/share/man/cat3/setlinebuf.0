     The three types of buffering available are unbuffered, block buffered,
     and line buffered.  When an output stream is unbuffered, information ap-
     pears on the destination file or terminal as soon as written; when it is
     block buffered many characters are saved up and written as a block; when
     it is line buffered characters are saved up until a newline is output or
     input is read from any stream attached to a terminal device (typically
     stdin).  The function fflush(3) may be used to force the block out early.
     (See fclose(3).)

     Normally all files are block buffered.  When the first I/O operation oc-
     curs on a file, malloc(3) is called, and an optimally-sized buffer is ob-
     tained.  If a stream refers to a terminal (as _s_t_d_o_u_t normally does) it is
     line buffered.  The standard error stream _s_t_d_e_r_r is always unbuffered.

     The sseettvvbbuuff() function may be used to alter the buffering behavior of a
     stream.  The _m_o_d_e parameter must be one of the following three macros:

           _IONBF  unbuffered

           _IOLBF  line buffered

           _IOFBF  fully buffered

     The _s_i_z_e parameter may be given as zero to obtain deferred optimal-size
     buffer allocation as usual.  If it is not zero, then except for un-
     buffered files, the _b_u_f argument should point to a buffer at least _s_i_z_e
     bytes long; this buffer will be used instead of the current buffer.  (If
     the _s_i_z_e argument is not zero but _b_u_f is NULL, a buffer of the given size
     will be allocated immediately, and released on close.  This is an exten-
     sion to ANSI C; portable code should use a size of 0 with any NULL
     buffer.)

     The sseettvvbbuuff() function may be used at any time, but may have peculiar
     side effects (such as discarding input or flushing output) if the stream
     is ``active''.  Portable applications should call it only once on any
     given stream, and before any I/O is performed.

     The other three calls are, in effect, simply aliases for calls to
     sseettvvbbuuff().  Except for the lack of a return value, the sseettbbuuff() function
     is exactly equivalent to the call

           setvbuf(stream, buf, buf ? _IOFBF : _IONBF, BUFSIZ);


     The sseettbbuuffffeerr() function is the same, except that the size of the buffer
     is up to the caller, rather than being determined by the default BUFSIZ.
     The sseettlliinneebbuuff() function is exactly equivalent to the call:

           setvbuf(stream, (char *)NULL, _IOLBF, 0);

     The sseettvvbbuuff() function returns 0 on success, or EOF if the request cannot
     be honored (note that the stream is still functional in this case).

     The sseettlliinneebbuuff() function returns what the equivalent sseettvvbbuuff() would
     have returned.

     The sseettbbuuff() and sseettvvbbuuff() functions conform to ANSI C X3.159-1989
     (``ANSI C '').

BBUUGGSS
     The sseettbbuuffffeerr() and sseettlliinneebbuuff() functions are not portable to versions
     of BSD before 4.2BSD. On 4.2BSD and 4.3BSD systems, sseettbbuuff() always uses
     a suboptimal buffer size and should be avoided.
