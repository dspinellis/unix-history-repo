     The ffnnmmaattcchh() function matches patterns according to the rules used by
     the shell.  It checks the string specified by the _s_t_r_i_n_g argument to see
     if it matches the pattern specified by the _p_a_t_t_e_r_n argument.

     The _f_l_a_g_s argument modifies the interpretation of _p_a_t_t_e_r_n and _s_t_r_i_n_g. The
     value of _f_l_a_g_s is the bitwise inclusive OR of any of the following con-
     stants, which are defined in the include file _f_n_m_a_t_c_h_._h.

     FNM_NOESCAPE  Normally, every occurrence of a backslash (`\') followed by
                   a character in _p_a_t_t_e_r_n is replaced by that character.  This
                   is done to negate any special meaning for the character.
                   If the FNM_NOESCAPE flag is set, a backslash character is
                   treated as an ordinary character.

     FNM_PATHNAME  Slash characters in _s_t_r_i_n_g must be explicitly matched by
                   slashes in _p_a_t_t_e_r_n. If this flag is not set, then slashes
                   are treated as regular characters.

     FNM_PERIOD    Leading periods in strings match periods in patterns.  The
                   definition of ``leading'' is related to the specification
                   of FNM_PATHNAME. A period is always ``leading'' if it is
                   the first character in _s_t_r_i_n_g. Additionally, if
                   FNM_PATHNAME is set, a period is ``leading'' if it immedi-
                   ately follows a slash.  _T_h_i_s _f_l_a_g _i_s _n_o_t _c_u_r_r_e_n_t_l_y

     The ffnnmmaattcchh() function returns zero if _s_t_r_i_n_g matches the pattern speci-
     fied by _p_a_t_t_e_r_n, otherwise, it returns the value FNM_NOMATCH.

     The ffnnmmaattcchh() function first appeared in 4.4BSD.

BBUUGGSS
     Quotes and slashes in range patterns are not handled correctly by this
     implementation.

     The FNM_PERIOD flag is not implemented.

     The pattern `*' matches the empty string, even if FNM_PATHNAME is speci-
     fied.
