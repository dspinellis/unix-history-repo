     This ssiiggnnaall() facility is a simplified interface to the more general
     sigaction(2) facility.

     Signals allow the manipulation of a process from outside its domain as
     well as allowing the process to manipulate itself or copies of itself
     (children). There are two general types of signals: those that cause ter-
     mination of a process and those that do not.  Signals which cause termi-
     nation of a program might result from an irrecoverable error or might be
     the result of a user at a terminal typing the `interrupt' character.
     Signals are used when a process is stopped because it wishes to access
     its control terminal while in the background (see tty(4)).  Signals are
     optionally generated when a process resumes after being stopped, when the
     status of child processes changes, or when input is ready at the control
     terminal.  Most signals result in the termination of the process receiv-
     ing them if no action is taken; some signals instead cause the process
     receiving them to be stopped, or are simply discarded if the process has
     not requested otherwise.  Except for the SIGKILL and SIGSTOP signals, the
     ssiiggnnaall() function allows for a signal to be caught, to be ignored, or to
     generate an interupt.  These signals are defined in the file <_s_i_g_n_a_l_._h>:

     SIGVTALRM       terminate process       virtual time alarm (see

     SIGPROF         terminate process       profiling timer alarm (see

     The _f_u_n_c procedure allows a user to choose the action upon receipt of a
     signal.  To set the default action of the signal to occur as listed
     above, _f_u_n_c should be SIG_DFL. A SIG_DFL resets the default action.  To
     ignore the signal _f_u_n_c should be SIG_IGN. This will cause subsequent in-
     stances of the signal to be ignored and pending instances to be discard-
     ed. If SIG_IGN is not used, further occurrences of the signal are auto-
     matically blocked and _f_u_n_c is called.

     The handled signal is unblocked with the function returns and the process
     continues from where it left off when the signal occured.  UUnnlliikkee pprreevvii--

     For some system calls, if a signal is caught while the call is executing
     and the call is permaturely terminated, the call is automatically
     restarted.  (The handler is installed using the SA_RESTART flag with
     sigaction(2).)  The affected system calls include read(2),  write(2),
     sendto(2),  recvfrom(2),  sendmsg(2) and recvmsg(2) on a communications
     channel or a low speed device and during a ioctl(2) or wait(2).  However,
     calls that have already committed are not restarted, but instead return a
     partial success (for example, a short read count).

     When a process which has installed signal handlers forks, the child pro-
     cess inherits the signals.  All caught signals may be reset to their de-
     fault action by a call to the execve(2) function; ignored signals remain
     ignored.

     The previous action is returned on a successful call.  Otherwise, -1 is
     returned and  the global variable _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the error.

     Signal will fail and no action will take place if one of the following
     occur:

     [EINVAL]  _S_i_g is not a valid signal number.

     [EINVAL]  An attempt is made to ignore or supply a handler for SIGKILL or
               SIGSTOP.
