     The ggeettttyy program is called by init(8) to open and initialize the tty
     line, read a login name, and invoke login(1).

     The argument _t_t_y is the special device file in _/_d_e_v to open for the ter-
     minal (for example, ``ttyh0'').  If there is no argument or the argument
     is `--', the tty line is assumed to be open as file descriptor 0.

     The _t_y_p_e argument can be used to make ggeettttyy treat the terminal line spe-
     cially.  This argument is used as an index into the ggeettttyyttaabb 55 database,
     to determine the characteristics of the line.  If there is no argument,
     or there is no such table, the _d_e_f_a_u_l_t table is used.  If there is no
     _/_e_t_c_/_g_e_t_t_y_t_a_b a set of system defaults is used.  If indicated by the
     table located, ggeettttyy will clear the terminal screen, print a banner head-
     ing, and prompt for a login name.  Usually either the banner or the login
     prompt will include the system hostname.

     Most of the default actions of ggeettttyy can be circumvented, or modified, by
     a suitable ggeettttyyttaabb table.

     The ggeettttyy program can be set to timeout after some interval, which will
     cause dial up lines to hang up if the login name is not entered reason-
     ably quickly.

     ttys file cannot be opened, likely because the requisite lines are either
     not configured into the system, the associated device was not attached
     during boot-time system configuration, or the special file in _/_d_e_v does
     not exist.
