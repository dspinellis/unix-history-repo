     FFttppdd is the Internet File Transfer Protocol server process.  The server
     uses the TCP protocol and listens at the port specified in the ``ftp''
     service specification; see services(5).

     Available options:

     --dd      Debugging information is written to the syslog using LOG_FTP.

     --ll      Each successful and failed ftp(1) session is logged using syslog
             with a facility of LOG_FTP.  If this option is specified twice,
             the retrieve (get), store (put), append, delete, make directory,
             remove directory and rename operations and their filename argu-
             ments are also logged.

     --TT      A client may also request a different timeout period; the maximum
             period allowed may be set to _t_i_m_e_o_u_t seconds with the --TT option.
             The default limit is 2 hours.

     --tt      The inactivity timeout period is set to _t_i_m_e_o_u_t seconds (the de-
             fault is 15 minutes).

     The file _/_e_t_c_/_n_o_l_o_g_i_n can be used to disable ftp access.  If the file ex-
     ists, ffttppdd displays it and exits.  If the file _/_e_t_c_/_f_t_p_w_e_l_c_o_m_e exists,
     ffttppdd prints it before issuing the ``ready'' message.  If the file
     _/_e_t_c_/_m_o_t_d exists, ffttppdd prints it after a successsful login.

     The ftp server currently supports the following ftp requests.  The case
     of the requests is ignored.

           XPWD       print the current working directory (deprecated)
           XRMD       remove a directory (deprecated)

     The following non-standard or UNIX specific commands are supported by the
     SITE request.

           RReeqquueesstt    DDeessccrriippttiioonn
           UMASK      change umask, e.g. ``SITE UMASK 002''
           IDLE       set idle-timer, e.g. ``SITE IDLE 60''
           CHMOD      change mode of a file, e.g. ``SITE CHMOD0 0CHMOD1
                      1CHMOD2
           HELP       give help information.

     The remaining ftp requests specified in Internet RFC 959 are recognized,
     but not implemented.  MDTM and SIZE are not specified in RFC 959, but
     will appear in the next updated FTP RFC.

     The ftp server will abort an active file transfer only when the ABOR com-
     mand is preceded by a Telnet "Interrupt Process" (IP) signal and a Telnet
     "Synch" signal in the command Telnet stream, as described in Internet RFC
     959.  If a STAT command is received during a data transfer, preceded by a
     Telnet IP and Synch, transfer status will be returned.

     FFttppdd interprets file names according to the ``globbing'' conventions used
     by csh(1).  This allows users to utilize the metacharacters ``*?[]{}~''.

     FFttppdd authenticates users according to three rules.

           1.   The login name must be in the password data base, _/_e_t_c_/_p_a_s_s_w_d,
                and not have a null password.  In this case a password must be
                provided by the client before any file operations may be per-
                formed.

           2.   The login name must not appear in the file _/_e_t_c_/_f_t_p_u_s_e_r_s.

           3.   The user must have a standard shell returned by
                getusershell(3).

           4.   If the user name is ``anonymous'' or ``ftp'', an anonymous ftp
                account must be present in the password file (user ``ftp'').
                In this case the user is allowed to log in by specifying any
                password (by convention an email address for the user should
                be used as the password).

     In the last case, ffttppdd takes special measures to restrict the client's
     access privileges.  The server performs a chroot(2) to the home directory
     of the ``ftp'' user.  In order that system security is not breached, it
     is recommended that the ``ftp'' subtree be constructed with care, follow-
     ing these rules:

           _~_f_t_p      Make the home directory owned by ``root'' and unwritable


                     by anyone.

           _~_f_t_p_/_b_i_n  Make this directory owned by ``root'' and unwritable by
                     anyone (mode 555).  The program ls(1) must be present to
                     support the list command.  This program should be mode
                     111.

           _~_f_t_p_/_e_t_c  Make this directory owned by ``root'' and unwritable by
                     anyone (mode 555).  The files passwd(5) and group(5) must
                     be present for the ls command to be able to produce owner
                     names rather than numbers.  The password field in passwd
                     is not used, and should not contain real passwords.  The
                     file _m_o_t_d, if present, will be printed after a sucessful
                     login.  These files should be mode 444.

           _~_f_t_p_/_p_u_b  Make this directory mode 777 and owned by ``ftp''. Guests
                     can then place files which are to be accessible via the
                     anonymous account in this directory.

     The server must run as the super-user to create sockets with privileged
     port numbers.  It maintains an effective user id of the logged in user,
     reverting to the super-user only when binding addresses to sockets.  The
     possible security holes have been extensively scrutinized, but are possi-
     bly incomplete.
