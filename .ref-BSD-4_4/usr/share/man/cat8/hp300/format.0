     ffoorrmmaatt - how to format disks and tapes

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     Currently, there are no ``native'' BSD media formatting utilities.  For-
     matting of both disks and cartridge tapes must be done either standalone
     or under HP-UX using the _m_e_d_i_a_i_n_i_t utility distributed by HP. Note that
     HP-brand cartridge tapes come pre-formatted, and HP disks are supposed
     to.

     The ffoorrmmaatt utility first appeared in 4.4BSD.
