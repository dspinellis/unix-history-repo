     The mmoouunntt__ppoorrttaall command attaches an instance of the portal daemon to the
     global filesystem namespace.  The conventional mount point is _/_p. This
     command is normally executed by mount(8) at boot time.

     The portal daemon provides an service.  Objects opened under the portal
     mount point are dynamically created by the portal daemon according to
     rules specified in the named configuration file.  Using this mechanism
     allows descriptors such as sockets to be made available in the filesystem
     namespace.

     The portal daemon works by being passed the full pathname of the object
     being opened.  The daemon creates an appropriate descriptor according to
     the rules in the configuration file, and then passes the descriptor back
     to the calling process as the result of the open system call.

     By convention, the portal daemon divides the namespace into sub-
     namespaces, each of which handles objects of a particular type.

     Current, two sub-namespaces are implemented: _t_c_p and _f_s. The _t_c_p names-
     pace takes a hostname and a port (slash separated) and creates an open
     TCP/IP connection.  The _f_s namespace opens the named file, starting back
     at the root directory.  This can be used to provide a controlled escape
     path from a chrooted environment.

     The configuration file contains a list of rules.  Each rule takes one
     line and consists of two or more whitespace separated fields.  A hash
     (``#'') character causes the remainder of a line to be ignored.  Blank
     lines are ignored.

     The first field is a pathname prefix to match against the requested path-
     name.  If a match is found, the second field tells the daemon what type
     of object to create.  Subsequent fields are passed to the creation func-
     tion.
