     VViippww edits the password file after setting the appropriate locks, and
     does any necessary processing after the password file is unlocked.  If
     the password file is already locked for editing by another user, vviippww
     will ask you to try again later. The default editor for vviippww is vi(1).

     VViippww performs a number of consistency checks on the password entries, and
     will not allow a password file with a ``mangled'' entry to be installed.
     If vviippww rejects the new password file, the user is prompted to re-enter
     the edit session.

     Once the information has been verified, vviippww uses pwd_mkdb(8) to update
     the user database.  This is run in the background, and, at very large
     sites could take several minutes.  Until this update is completed, the
     password file is unavailable for other updates and the new information is
     not available to programs.
