       named.restart - stop and restart the name server

       This  command  sends  a SIGKILL to the running name server
       and then starts a new one.

BBUUGGSS
       Does not check to see if the name server is actually  run-
       ning,  and  could  use  a  stale  PID cache file which may
       result in the death of an unrelated process.

       Does not wait after killing the old server before starting
       a  new  one;  since the server could take some time to die
       and the new one will experience a fatal error if  the  old
       one isn't gone by the time it starts, you can be left in a
       situation where you have no name server at all.
