     KKggmmoonn is a tool used when profiling the operating system.  When no argu-
     ments are supplied, kkggmmoonn indicates the state of operating system profil-
     ing as running, off, or not configured.  (see config(8))  If the --pp flag
     is specified, kkggmmoonn extracts profile data from the operating system and
     produces a _g_m_o_n_._o_u_t file suitable for later analysis by gprof(1).

     The options are as follows:

     --bb      Resume the collection of profile data.

     --hh      Stop the collection of profile data.

     --pp      Dump the contents of the profile buffers into a _g_m_o_n_._o_u_t file.

     --rr      Reset all the profile buffers.  If the --pp flag is also specified,
             the _g_m_o_n_._o_u_t file is generated before the buffers are reset.

     --MM      Extract values associated with the name list from the specified
             core instead of the default ``/dev/kmem''.

     --NN      Extract the name list from the specified system instead of the
             default ``/vmunix''.

     If neither --bb nor --hh is specified, the state of profiling collection re-
     mains unchanged.  For example, if the --pp flag is specified and profile
     data is being collected, profiling will be momentarily suspended, the op-
     erating system profile buffers will be dumped, and profiling will be im-
     mediately resumed.

     Users with only read permission on _/_d_e_v_/_k_m_e_m cannot change the state of
     profiling collection.  They can get a _g_m_o_n_._o_u_t file with the warning that
     the data may be inconsistent if profiling is in progress.
