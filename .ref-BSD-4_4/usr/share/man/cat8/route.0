     RRoouuttee is a program used to manually manipulate the network routing ta-
     bles.  It normally is not needed, as the system routing table management
     daemon, routed(8),  should tend to this task.

     Options supported by rroouuttee:

     --nn      Prevent attempts to print host and network names symbolically
             when reporting actions.

     --vv      (verbose) Print additional details.

     --qq      Suppress all output.

     Commands accepted by rroouuttee:

     aadddd         Add a route.
     fflluusshh       Remove all routes.
     ddeelleettee      Delete a specific route.
     cchhaannggee      Change aspects of a route (such as its gateway).
     ggeett         Lookup and display the route for a destination.
     mmoonniittoorr     Continuously report any changes to the routing information
                 base, routing lookup misses, or suspected network partion-
                 ings.

     The monitor command has the syntax

           rroouuttee [--nn] mmoonniittoorr

     The flush command has the syntax

           rroouuttee [--nn] fflluusshh [_f_a_m_i_l_y]

     Where the address family may be specified by any of the --oossii, --xxnnss, or
     --iinneett keywords.

     The other commands have the following syntax:

           rroouuttee [--nn] _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [--nneett | --hhoosstt] _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n _g_a_t_e_w_a_y

     where _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n is the destination host or network, _g_a_t_e_w_a_y is the
     next-hop gateway to which packets should be addressed.  Routes to a par-
     ticular host are distinguished from those to a network by interpreting
     the Internet address associated with _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n. The optional keywords
     --nneett and --hhoosstt force the destination to be interpreted as a network or a
     host, respectively.  Otherwise, if the _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n has a ``local address
     part'' of INADDR_ANY , or if the _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n is the symbolic name of a
     network, then the route is assumed to be to a network; otherwise, it is
     presumed to be a route to a host.

     For example, 128.32 is interpreted as --hhoosstt 128.0.0.32; 128.32.130 is in-
     terpreted as --hhoosstt 128.32.0.130; --nneett 128.32 is interpreted as
     128.32.0.0; and --nneett 128.32.130 is interpreted as 128.32.130.0.

     If the route is via an interface rather than via a gateway, the
     --iinntteerrffaaccee modifier should be specified; the gateway given is the address
     of this host on the common network, indicating the interface to be used
     for transmission.

     The optional modifiers --xxnnss, and --oossii specify that all subsequent ad-
     dresses are in the XNS or OSI address families, and the names must be nu-
     meric specifications rather than symbolic names.

     The optional --nneettmmaasskk qualifier is intended to achieve the effect of an
     OSI ESIS redirect with the netmask option.  One specifies an additional
     ensuing address parameter (to be interpreted as a network mask).  The im-
     plicit network mask generated in the inet case can be overridden by mak-
     ing sure this option follows the destination parameter.

     The optional modifiers --rrtttt, --rrttttvvaarr, --sseennddppiippee, --rreeccvvppiippee, --mmttuu,
     --hhooppccoouunntt, --eexxppiirree, and --sssstthhrreesshh provide initial values to metrics main-
     tained in the routing entry.  These may be individually locked by preced-
     ing each such modifier to be locked by the --lloocckk meta-modifier, or one
     can specify that all ensuing metrics may be locked by the --lloocckkrreesstt meta-
     modifier.

     In a cchhaannggee or aadddd command where the destination and gateway are not suf-
     ficient to specify the route (as in the ISO case where several interfaces
     may have the same address), the --iiffpp or --iiffaa modifiers may be used to de-
     termine the interface or interface address.

     All symbolic names specified for a _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n or _g_a_t_e_w_a_y are looked up
     first as a host name using gethostbyname(3).  If this lookup fails, get-
     netbyname(3) is then used to interpret the name as that of a network.

     RRoouuttee uses a routing socket and the new message types RTM_ADD,
     RTM_DELETE, RTM_GET, and RTM_CHANGE.  As such, only the super-user may
     modify the routing tables.

     If the fflluusshh command is specified, rroouuttee will ``flush'' the routing ta-
     bles of all gateway entries.  One can choose to flush only those routes
     whose destinations are of a given address family, by specifying an op-
     tional keyword describing which address family.

             The specified route is being added to the tables.  The values
             printed are from the routing table entry supplied in the ioctl(2)
             call.  If the gateway address used was not the primary address of
             the gateway (the first one returned by gethostbyname(3)),  the
             gateway address is printed numerically as well as symbolically.

             When the fflluusshh command is specified, each routing table entry
             deleted is indicated with a message of this form.

             An attempt to add a route failed because the gateway listed was
             not on a directly-connected network.  The next-hop gateway must
             be given.

             A delete operation was attempted for an entry which wasn't pre-
             sent in the tables.

             An add operation was attempted, but the system was low on re-
             sources and was unable to allocate memory to create the new en-
             try.
