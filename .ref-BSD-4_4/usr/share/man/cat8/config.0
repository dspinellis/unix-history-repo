     CCoonnffiigg builds a set of system configuration files from the file
     _S_Y_S_T_E_M___N_A_M_E which describes the system to configure.  A second file tells
     ccoonnffiigg what files are needed to generate a system and can be augmented by
     configuration specific set of files that give alternate files for a spe-
     cific machine.  (see the _F_I_L_E_S section below)

     Available option and operand:

     --pp           If the --pp option is supplied, ccoonnffiigg will configure a system
                  for profiling; for example, kgmon(8) and gprof(1).

     _S_Y_S_T_E_M___N_A_M_E  specifies the name of the system configuration file contain-
                  ing device specifications, configuration options and other
                  system parameters for one system configuration.

     CCoonnffiigg should be run from the _c_o_n_f subdirectory of the system source
     (usually _/_s_y_s_/_c_o_n_f). CCoonnffiigg assumes the directory _._._/_S_Y_S_T_E_M___N_A_M_E exists
     and places all output files there.  The output of ccoonnffiigg consists of a
     number of files; for the VAX, they are: _i_o_c_o_n_f_._c, a description of what
     I/O devices are attached to the system; _u_b_g_l_u_e_._s, a set of interrupt ser-
     vice routines for devices attached to the UNIBUS; _u_b_v_e_c_._s, offsets into a
     structure used for counting per-device interrupts; _M_a_k_e_f_i_l_e, used by
     make(1) in building the system; header files, definitions of the number
     of various devices that will be compiled into the system; swap configura-
     tion files, definitions for the disk areas to be used for swapping, the
     root file system, argument processing, and system dumps.

     After running ccoonnffiigg, it is necessary to run ``make depend'' in the di-
     rectory where the new makefile was created.  CCoonnffiigg prints a reminder of
     this when it completes.

     If any other error messages are produced by ccoonnffiigg, the problems in the
     configuration file should be corrected and ccoonnffiigg should be run again.
     Attempts to compile a system that had configuration errors are likely to
     fail.
