       _N_a_m_e_d_-_x_f_e_r is an ancillary program executed by _n_a_m_e_d(8) to
       perform an inbound zone transfer.  It is  rarely  executed
       directly, and only by system administrators who are trying
       to debug a zone transfer problem.  See RFC's  1033,  1034,
       and  1035 for more information on the Internet name-domain
       system.

       Options are:

       --zz     specifies the name of the zone to be transferred.

       --ff     specifies the name of the file into which the  zone
              should  be dumped when it is received from the pri-
              mary server.

       --ss     specifies the serial number of our current copy  of
              this  zone.   If the SOA RR we get from the primary
              server does not have a serial  number  higher  than
              this, the transfer will be aborted.

       --dd     Print  debugging  information.   A number after the
              ``d'' determines the level of messages printed.

       --ll     Specifies a log file for debugging  messages.   The
              default  is  system-  dependent  but  is usually in
              _/_v_a_r_/_t_m_p or _/_u_s_r_/_t_m_p.  Note that this only  applies
              if _-_d is also specified.

       --tt     Specifies  a trace file which will contain a proto-
              col trace of the zone transfer.  This  is  probably
              only  of  interest  to  people  debugging  the name
              server itself.

       --pp     Use a different port number.  The  default  is  the
              standard  port  number  as  returned  by getservby-
              name(3) for service ``domain''.

       Additional arguments are taken as name server addresses in
       so-called  ``dotted-quad''  syntax  only; no host name are
       allowed here.  At least one  address  must  be  specified.
       Any  additional  addresses  will  be tried in order if the
       first one fails to transfer to us successfully.
