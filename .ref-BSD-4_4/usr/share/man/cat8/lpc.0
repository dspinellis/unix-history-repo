     LLppcc is used by the system administrator to control the operation of the
     line printer system.  For each line printer configured in _/_e_t_c_/_p_r_i_n_t_c_a_p,
     llppcc may be used to:

           ++oo   disable or enable a printer,

           ++oo   disable or enable a printer's spooling queue,

           ++oo   rearrange the order of jobs in a spooling queue,

           ++oo   find the status of printers, and their associated spooling
               queues and printer dameons.

     Without any arguments, llppcc will prompt for commands from the standard in-
     put.  If arguments are supplied, llppcc interprets the first argument as a
     command and the remaining arguments as parameters to the command.  The
     standard input may be redirected causing llppcc to read commands from file.
     Commands may be abreviated; the following is the list of recognized com-
     mands.

     ?? [command ...]
     hheellpp [command ...]
             Print a short description of each command specified in the argu-
             ment list, or, if no arguments are given, a list of the recog-
             nized commands.

     aabboorrtt { all | printer }
             Terminate an active spooling daemon on the local host immediately
             and then disable printing (preventing new daemons from being
             started by lpr)  for the specified printers.

     cclleeaann { all | printer }
             Remove any temporary files, data files, and control files that
             cannot be printed (i.e., do not form a complete printer job) from
             the specified printer queue(s) on the local machine.

     ddiissaabbllee { all | printer }
             Turn the specified printer queues off.  This prevents new printer
             jobs from being entered into the queue by lpr.

     ddoowwnn { all | printer } message ...
             Turn the specified printer queue off, disable printing and put
             _m_e_s_s_a_g_e in the printer status file. The message doesn't need to
             be quoted, the remaining arguments are treated like echo(1).
             This is normally used to take a printer down and let others know
             why lpq(1) will indicate the printer is down and print the status
             message).

     eennaabbllee { all | printer }
             Enable spooling on the local queue for the listed printers.  This
             will allow lpr(1) to put new jobs in the spool queue.

     eexxiitt
     qquuiitt    Exit from lpc.



     rreessttaarrtt { all | printer }
             Attempt to start a new printer daemon.  This is useful when some
             abnormal condition causes the daemon to die unexpectedly leaving
             jobs in the queue.  Lpq will report that there is no daemon pre-
             sent when this condition occurs.  If the user is the super-user,
             try to abort the current daemon first (i.e., kill and restart a
             stuck daemon).

     ssttaarrtt { all | printer }
             Enable printing and start a spooling daemon for the listed print-
             ers.

     ssttaattuuss { all | printer }
             Display the status of daemons and queues on the local machine.

     ssttoopp { all | printer }
             Stop a spooling daemon after the current job completes and dis-
             able printing.

     ttooppqq printer [ jobnum ... ] [ user ... ]
             Place the jobs in the order listed at the top of the printer
             queue.

     uupp { all | printer }
             Enable everything and start a new printer daemon. Undoes the ef-
             fects of ddoowwnn.
