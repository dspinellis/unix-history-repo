     This section contains information related to system operation and mainte-
     nance.  It describes commands used to create new file systems, `newfs',
     verify the integrity of the file systems, `fsck',  control disk usage,
     `edquota',  maintain system backups, `dump',  and recover files when
     disks die an untimely death, `restore'.  The manual `format'  should be
     consulted when formatting disk packs respective to the architecture the
     system is running on.  Network related services like `inetd'  and `ftpd'
     are also described.  The section `crash'  should be consulted in under-
     standing how to interpret system crash dumps.
