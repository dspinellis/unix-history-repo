     RReeaadd() attempts to read _n_b_y_t_e_s of data from the object referenced by the
     descriptor _d into the buffer pointed to by _b_u_f. RReeaaddvv() performs the same
     action, but scatters the input data into the _i_o_v_c_n_t buffers specified by
     the members of the _i_o_v array: iov[0], iov[1], ..., iov[iovcnt-1].

     For rreeaaddvv(), the _i_o_v_e_c structure is defined as
           struct iovec {
                   void *iov_base;
                   int iov_len;
           };

     Each _i_o_v_e_c entry specifies the base address and length of an area in mem-
     ory where data should be placed.  RReeaaddvv() will always fill an area com-
     pletely before proceeding to the next.

     On objects capable of seeking, the rreeaadd() starts at a position given by
     the pointer associated with _d (see lseek(2)).  Upon return from rreeaadd(),
     the pointer is incremented by the number of bytes actually read.

     Objects that are not capable of seeking always read from the current po-
     sition.  The value of the pointer associated with such an object is unde-
     fined.

     Upon successful completion, rreeaadd() and rreeaaddvv() return the number of bytes
     actually read and placed in the buffer.  The system guarantees to read
     the number of bytes requested if the descriptor references a normal file
     that has that many bytes left before the end-of-file, but in no other
     case.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEESS
     If successful, the number of bytes actually read is returned. Upon read-
     ing end-of-file, zero is returned.  Otherwise, a -1 is returned and the
     global variable _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the error.

EERRRROORRSS
     RReeaadd() and rreeaaddvv() will succeed unless:

     [EBADF]       _D is not a valid file or socket descriptor open for read-
                   ing.

     [EFAULT]      _B_u_f points outside the allocated address space.

     [EIO]         An I/O error occurred while reading from the file system.

     [EINTR]       A read from a slow device was interrupted before any data
                   arrived by the delivery of a signal.


     [EINVAL]      The pointer associated with _d was negative.

     [EAGAIN]      The file was marked for non-blocking I/O, and no data were
                   ready to be read.

     In addition, rreeaaddvv() may return one of the following errors:

     [EINVAL]      _I_o_v_c_n_t was less than or equal to 0, or greater than 16.

     [EINVAL]      One of the _i_o_v___l_e_n values in the _i_o_v array was negative.

     [EINVAL]      The sum of the _i_o_v___l_e_n values in the _i_o_v array overflowed a
                   32-bit integer.

     [EFAULT]      Part of the _i_o_v points outside the process's allocated ad-
                   dress space.

     RReeaadd() is expected to conform to IEEE Std 1003.1-1988 (``POSIX'').

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     The rreeaaddvv() function call appeared in 4.2BSD. A rreeaadd function call ap-
     peared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.
