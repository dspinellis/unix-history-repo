     rreennaammee(_c_o_n_s_t _c_h_a_r _*_f_r_o_m, _c_o_n_s_t _c_h_a_r _*_t_o);

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     RReennaammee() causes the link named _f_r_o_m to be renamed as _t_o. If _t_o exists, it
     is first removed.  Both _f_r_o_m and _t_o must be of the same type (that is,
     both directories or both non-directories), and must reside on the same
     file system.

     RReennaammee() guarantees that an instance of _t_o will always exist, even if the
     system should crash in the middle of the operation.

     If the final component of _f_r_o_m is a symbolic link, the symbolic link is
     renamed, not the file or directory to which it points.

CCAAVVEEAATT
     The system can deadlock if a loop in the file system graph is present.
     This loop takes the form of an entry in directory `_a', say `_a_/_f_o_o', being
     a hard link to directory `_b', and an entry in directory `_b', say `_b_/_b_a_r',
     being a hard link to directory `_a'. When such a loop exists and two sepa-
     rate processes attempt to perform `rename a/foo b/bar' and `rename b/bar
     a/foo', respectively, the system may deadlock attempting to lock both di-
     rectories for modification.  Hard links to directories should be replaced
     by symbolic links by the system administrator.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEESS
     A 0 value is returned if the operation succeeds, otherwise rreennaammee() re-
     turns -1 and the global variable _e_r_r_n_o indicates the reason for the fail-
     ure.

EERRRROORRSS
     RReennaammee() will fail and neither of the argument files will be affected if:

     [EINVAL]      Either pathname contains a character with the high-order
                   bit set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]
                   A component of either pathname exceeded 255 characters, or
                   the entire length of either path name exceeded 1023 charac-
                   ters.

     [ENOENT]      A component of the _f_r_o_m path does not exist, or a path pre-
                   fix of _t_o does not exist.

     [EACCES]      A component of either path prefix denies search permission.

     [EACCES]      The requested link requires writing in a directory with a
                   mode that denies write permission.

     [EPERM]       The directory containing _f_r_o_m is marked sticky, and neither
                   the containing directory nor _f_r_o_m are owned by the effec-
                   tive user ID.

     [EPERM]       The _t_o file exists, the directory containing _t_o is marked
                   sticky, and neither the containing directory nor _t_o are


                   owned by the effective user ID.

     [ELOOP]       Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating ei-
                   ther pathname.

     [ENOTDIR]     A component of either path prefix is not a directory.

     [ENOTDIR]     _f_r_o_m is a directory, but _t_o is not a directory.

     [EISDIR]      _t_o is a directory, but _f_r_o_m is not a directory.

     [EXDEV]       The link named by _t_o and the file named by _f_r_o_m are on dif-
                   ferent logical devices (file systems).  Note that this er-
                   ror code will not be returned if the implementation permits
                   cross-device links.

     [ENOSPC]      The directory in which the entry for the new name is being
                   placed cannot be extended because there is no space left on
                   the file system containing the directory.

     [EDQUOT]      The directory in which the entry for the new name is being
                   placed cannot be extended because the user's quota of disk
                   blocks on the file system containing the directory has been
                   exhausted.

     [EIO]         An I/O error occurred while making or updating a directory
                   entry.

     [EROFS]       The requested link requires writing in a directory on a
                   read-only file system.

     [EFAULT]      _P_a_t_h points outside the process's allocated address space.

     [EINVAL]      _F_r_o_m is a parent directory of _t_o, or an attempt is made to
                   rename `.' or `..'.

     [ENOTEMPTY]   _T_o is a directory and is not empty.
