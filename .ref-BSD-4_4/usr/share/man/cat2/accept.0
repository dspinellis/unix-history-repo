     The argument _s is a socket that has been created with socket(2),  bound
     to an address with bind(2),  and is listening for connections after a
     listen(2).  The aacccceepptt() argument extracts the first connection request
     on the queue of pending connections, creates a new socket with the same
     properties of _s and allocates a new file descriptor for the socket.  If
     no pending connections are present on the queue, and the socket is not
     marked as non-blocking, aacccceepptt() blocks the caller until a connection is
     present.  If the socket is marked non-blocking and no pending connections
     are present on the queue, aacccceepptt() returns an error as described below.
     The accepted socket may not be used to accept more connections.  The
     original socket _s remains open.

     The argument _a_d_d_r is a result parameter that is filled in with the ad-
     dress of the connecting entity, as known to the communications layer.
     The exact format of the _a_d_d_r parameter is determined by the domain in
     which the communication is occurring.  The _a_d_d_r_l_e_n is a value-result pa-
     rameter; it should initially contain the amount of space pointed to by
     _a_d_d_r; on return it will contain the actual length (in bytes) of the ad-
     dress returned.  This call is used with connection-based socket types,
     currently with SOCK_STREAM.

     It is possible to select(2) a socket for the purposes of doing an
     aacccceepptt() by selecting it for read.

     For certain protocols which require an explicit confirmation, such as ISO
     or DATAKIT, aacccceepptt() can be thought of as merely dequeueing the next con-
     nection request and not implying confirmation.  Confirmation can be im-
     plied by a normal read or write on the new file desciptor, and rejection
     can be implied by closing the new socket.

     One can obtain user connection request data without confirming the con-
     nection by issuing a recvmsg(2) call with an _m_s_g___i_o_v_l_e_n of 0 and a non-
     zero _m_s_g___c_o_n_t_r_o_l_l_e_n, or by issuing a getsockopt(2) request.  Similarly,
     one can provide user connection rejection information by issuing a
     sendmsg(2) call with providing only the control information, or by call-
     ing setsockopt(2).

     The call returns -1 on error.  If it succeeds, it returns a non-negative
     integer that is a descriptor for the accepted socket.

     The aacccceepptt() will fail if:

     [EBADF]      The descriptor is invalid.

     [ENOTSOCK]   The descriptor references a file, not a socket.

     [EOPNOTSUPP]
                  The referenced socket is not of type SOCK_STREAM.

     [EFAULT]     The _a_d_d_r parameter is not in a writable part of the user ad-

                  dress space.

     [EWOULDBLOCK]
                  The socket is marked non-blocking and no connections are
                  present to be accepted.
