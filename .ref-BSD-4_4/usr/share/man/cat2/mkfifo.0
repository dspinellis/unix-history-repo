     MMkkffiiffoo() creates a new fifo file with name _p_a_t_h. The access permissions
     are specified by _m_o_d_e and restricted by the umask(2) of the calling pro-
     cess.

     The fifo's owner ID is set to the process's effective user ID.  The fi-
     fo's group ID is set to that of the parent directory in which it is cre-
     ated.

     A 0 return value indicates success.  A -1 return value indicates an er-
     ror, and an error code is stored in _e_r_r_n_o.

     MMkkffiiffoo() will fail and no fifo will be created if:

     [ENOTSUPP]  The kernel has not been configured to support fifo's.

     [ENOTDIR]   A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

     [EINVAL]    The pathname contains a character with the high-order bit
                 set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]
                 A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an en-
                 tire path name exceeded 1023 characters.

     [ENOENT]    A component of the path prefix does not exist.

     [EACCES]    Search permission is denied for a component of the path pre-
                 fix.

     [ELOOP]     Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the
                 pathname.

     [EPERM]     The _p_a_t_h argument contains a byte with the high-order bit
                 set.

     [EROFS]     The named file resides on a read-only file system.

     [EEXIST]    The named file exists.

     [ENOSPC]    The directory in which the entry for the new fifo is being
                 placed cannot be extended because there is no space left on
                 the file system containing the directory.

     [ENOSPC]    There are no free inodes on the file system on which the fifo
                 is being created.

     [EDQUOT]    The directory in which the entry for the new fifo is being
                 placed cannot be extended because the user's quota of disk
                 blocks on the file system containing the directory has been


                 exhausted.

     [EDQUOT]    The user's quota of inodes on the file system on which the
                 fifo is being created has been exhausted.

     [EIO]       An I/O error occurred while making the directory entry or al-
                 locating the inode.

     [EIO]       An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
                 file system.

     [EFAULT]    _P_a_t_h points outside the process's allocated address space.
