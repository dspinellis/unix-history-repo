     The lliinnkk() function call atomically creates the specified directory entry
     (hard link) _n_a_m_e_2 with the attributes of the underlying object pointed at
     by _n_a_m_e_1 If the link is successful: the link count of the underlying ob-
     ject is incremented; _n_a_m_e_1 and _n_a_m_e_2 share equal access and rights to the
     underlying object.

     If _n_a_m_e_1 is removed, the file _n_a_m_e_2 is not deleted and the link count of
     the underlying object is decremented.

     _N_a_m_e_1 must exist for the hard link to succeed and both _n_a_m_e_1 and _n_a_m_e_2
     must be in the same file system.  Unless the caller is the super-user,
     _n_a_m_e_1 may not be a directory.

     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the error.

     LLiinnkk() will fail and no link will be created if: are true:

     [ENOTDIR]     A component of either path prefix is not a directory.

     [EINVAL]      Either pathname contains a character with the high-order
                   bit set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]
                   A component of either pathname exceeded 255 characters, or
                   entire length of either path name exceeded 1023 characters.

     [ENOENT]      A component of either path prefix does not exist.

     [EACCES]      A component of either path prefix denies search permission.

     [EACCES]      The requested link requires writing in a directory with a
                   mode that denies write permission.

     [ELOOP]       Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating one
                   of the pathnames.

     [ENOENT]      The file named by _n_a_m_e_1 does not exist.

     [EEXIST]      The link named by _n_a_m_e_2 does exist.

     [EPERM]       The file named by _n_a_m_e_1 is a directory and the effective
                   user ID is not super-user.

     [EXDEV]       The link named by _n_a_m_e_2 and the file named by _n_a_m_e_1 are on
                   different file systems.

     [ENOSPC]      The directory in which the entry for the new link is being
                   placed cannot be extended because there is no space left on


                   the file system containing the directory.

     [EDQUOT]      The directory in which the entry for the new link is being
                   placed cannot be extended because the user's quota of disk
                   blocks on the file system containing the directory has been
                   exhausted.

     [EIO]         An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
                   file system to make the directory entry.

     [EROFS]       The requested link requires writing in a directory on a
                   read-only file system.

     [EFAULT]      One of the pathnames specified is outside the process's al-
                   located address space.
