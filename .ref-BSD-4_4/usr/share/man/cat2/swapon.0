     SSwwaappoonn() makes the block device _s_p_e_c_i_a_l available to the system for allo-
     cation for paging and swapping.  The names of potentially available de-
     vices are known to the system and defined at system configuration time.
     The size of the swap area on _s_p_e_c_i_a_l is calculated at the time the device
     is first made available for swapping.

     If an error has occurred, a value of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to
     indicate the error.

     SSwwaappoonn() succeeds unless:

     [ENOTDIR]     A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

     [EINVAL]      The pathname contains a character with the high-order bit
                   set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]
                   A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an
                   entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.

     [ENOENT]      The named device does not exist.

     [EACCES]      Search permission is denied for a component of the path
                   prefix.

     [ELOOP]       Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the
                   pathname.

     [EPERM]       The caller is not the super-user.

     [ENOTBLK]     _S_p_e_c_i_a_l is not a block device.

     [EBUSY]       The device specified by _s_p_e_c_i_a_l has already been made
                   available for swapping

     [EINVAL]      The device configured by _s_p_e_c_i_a_l was not configured into
                   the system as a swap device.

     [ENXIO]       The major device number of _s_p_e_c_i_a_l is out of range (this
                   indicates no device driver exists for the associated hard-
                   ware).

     [EIO]         An I/O error occurred while opening the swap device.

     [EFAULT]      _S_p_e_c_i_a_l points outside the process's allocated address
                   space.

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
     swapon(8),  config(8)

BBUUGGSS
     There is no way to stop swapping on a disk so that the pack may be dis-
     mounted.

     This call will be upgraded in future versions of the system.

     The sswwaappoonn function call appeared in 4.0BSD.
