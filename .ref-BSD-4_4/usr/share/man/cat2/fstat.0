     The ssttaatt() function obtains information about the file pointed to by
     _p_a_t_h. Read, write or execute permission of the named file is not re-
     quired, but all directories listed in the path name leading to the file
     must be seachable.

     LLssttaatt() is like ssttaatt() except in the case where the named file is a sym-
     bolic link, in which case llssttaatt() returns information about the link,
     while ssttaatt() returns information about the file the link references.  Un-
     like other filesystem objects, symbolic links do not have an owner,
     group, access mode, times, etc.  Instead, these attributes are taken from
     the directory that contains the link.  The only attributes returned from
     an llssttaatt() that refer to the symbolic link itself are the file type
     (S_IFLNK), size, blocks, and link count (always 1).

     The ffssttaatt() obtains the same information about an open file known by the
     file descriptor _f_d, such as would be obtained by an open call.

     _B_u_f is a pointer to a ssttaatt() structure as defined by <_s_y_s_/_s_t_a_t_._h> (shown
     below) and into which information is placed concerning the file.

     struct stat {
         dev_t    st_dev;    /* device inode resides on */
         ino_t    st_ino;    /* inode's number */
         mode_t   st_mode;   /* inode protection mode */
         nlink_t  st_nlink;  /* number or hard links to the file */
         uid_t    st_uid;    /* user-id of owner */
         gid_t    st_gid;    /* group-id of owner */
         dev_t    st_rdev;   /* device type, for special file inode */
         off_t    st_size;   /* file size, in bytes */
         time_t   st_atime;  /* time of last access */
         long     st_spare1;
         time_t   st_mtime;  /* time of last data modification */
         long     st_spare2;
         time_t   st_ctime;  /* time of last file status change */
         long     st_spare3;
         long     st_blksize;/* optimal file sys I/O ops blocksize */
         long     st_blocks; /* blocks allocated for file */
         u_long   st_flags;  /* user defined flags for file */
         u_long   st_gen;    /* file generation number */
     };

     The time-related fields of _s_t_r_u_c_t _s_t_a_t are as follows:

     st_atime   Time when file data last accessed.  Changed by the following


                system calls: mknod(2),  utimes(2),  and read(2).

     st_mtime   Time when file data last modified.  Changed by the following
                system calls: mknod(2),  utimes(2),  write(2).

     st_ctime   Time when file status was last changed (inode data modifica-
                tion).  Changed by the following system calls: chmod(2)
                chown(2),  link(2),  mknod(2),  rename(2),  unlink(2),
                utimes(2),  write(2).

     st_blocks  The actual number of blocks allocated for the file in 512-byte
                units.

     The status information word _s_t___m_o_d_e has bits:

     #define S_IFMT 0170000           /* type of file */
     #define        S_IFIFO  0010000  /* named pipe (fifo) */
     #define        S_IFCHR  0020000  /* character special */
     #define        S_IFDIR  0040000  /* directory */
     #define        S_IFBLK  0060000  /* block special */
     #define        S_IFREG  0100000  /* regular */
     #define        S_IFLNK  0120000  /* symbolic link */
     #define        S_IFSOCK 0140000  /* socket */
     #define S_ISUID 0004000  /* set user id on execution */
     #define S_ISGID 0002000  /* set group id on execution */
     #define S_ISVTX 0001000  /* save swapped text even after use */
     #define S_IRUSR 0000400  /* read permission, owner */
     #define S_IWUSR 0000200  /* write permission, owner */
     #define S_IXUSR 0000100  /* execute/search permission, owner */

     For a list of access modes, see <_s_y_s_/_s_t_a_t_._h>, access(2) and chmod(2).

     Upon successful completion a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the error.

     SSttaatt() and llssttaatt() will fail if:

     [ENOTDIR]       A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

     [EINVAL]        The pathname contains a character with the high-order bit
                     set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]  A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an
                     entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.

     [ENOENT]        The named file does not exist.

     [EACCES]        Search permission is denied for a component of the path
                     prefix.

     [ELOOP]         Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating
                     the pathname.

     [EFAULT]        _B_u_f or _n_a_m_e points to an invalid address.

     [EIO]           An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to
                     the file system.

     FFssttaatt() will fail if:

     [EBADF]   _f_d is not a valid open file descriptor.



     [EFAULT]  _B_u_f points to an invalid address.

     [EIO]     An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file
               system.

     The fields in the stat structure currently marked _s_t___s_p_a_r_e_1, _s_t___s_p_a_r_e_2,
     and _s_t___s_p_a_r_e_3 are present in preparation for inode time stamps expanding
     to 64 bits.  This, however, can break certain programs that depend on the
     time stamps being contiguous (in calls to utimes(2)).

     Applying fstat to a socket (and thus to a pipe) returns a zero'd buffer,
     except for the blocksize field, and a unique device and inode number.

     The ssttaatt() and ffssttaatt() function calls are expected to conform to IEEE Std
