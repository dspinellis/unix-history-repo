     WWrriittee() attempts to write _n_b_y_t_e_s of data to the object referenced by the
     descriptor _d from the buffer pointed to by _b_u_f. WWrriitteevv() performs the
     same action, but gathers the output data from the _i_o_v_c_n_t buffers speci-
     fied by the members of the _i_o_v array: iov[0], iov[1], ..., iov[iovcnt-1].

     For wwrriitteevv(), the _i_o_v_e_c structure is defined as:
           struct iovec {
                   void *iov_base;
                   int iov_len;
           };

     Each _i_o_v_e_c entry specifies the base address and length of an area in mem-
     ory from which data should be written.  WWrriitteevv() will always write a com-
     plete area before proceeding to the next.

     On objects capable of seeking, the wwrriittee() starts at a position given by
     the pointer associated with _d, see lseek(2).  Upon return from wwrriittee(),
     the pointer is incremented by the number of bytes which were written.

     Objects that are not capable of seeking always write from the current po-
     sition.  The value of the pointer associated with such an object is unde-
     fined.

     If the real user is not the super-user, then wwrriittee() clears the set-user-
     id bit on a file.  This prevents penetration of system security by a user
     who ``captures'' a writable set-user-id file owned by the super-user.

     When using non-blocking I/O on objects such as sockets that are subject
     to flow control, wwrriittee() and wwrriitteevv() may write fewer bytes than request-
     ed; the return value must be noted, and the remainder of the operation
     should be retried when possible.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEESS
     Upon successful completion the number of bytes which were written is re-
     turned.  Otherwise a -1 is returned and the global variable _e_r_r_n_o is set
     to indicate the error.

     WWrriittee() and wwrriitteevv() will fail and the file pointer will remain unchanged
     if:

     [EBADF]       _D is not a valid descriptor open for writing.

     [EPIPE]       An attempt is made to write to a pipe that is not open for
                   reading by any process.

     [EPIPE]       An attempt is made to write to a socket of type that is not

                   connected to a peer socket.

     [EFBIG]       An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the pro-
                   cess's file size limit or the maximum file size.

     [EFAULT]      Part of _i_o_v or data to be written to the file points out-
                   side the process's allocated address space.

     [EINVAL]      The pointer associated with _d was negative.

     [ENOSPC]      There is no free space remaining on the file system con-
                   taining the file.

     [EDQUOT]      The user's quota of disk blocks on the file system contain-
                   ing the file has been exhausted.

     [EIO]         An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
                   file system.

     [EAGAIN]      The file was marked for non-blocking I/O, and no data could
                   be written immediately.

     In addition, wwrriitteevv() may return one of the following errors:

     [EINVAL]      _I_o_v_c_n_t was less than or equal to 0, or greater than 16.

     [EINVAL]      One of the _i_o_v___l_e_n values in the _i_o_v array was negative.

     [EINVAL]      The sum of the _i_o_v___l_e_n values in the _i_o_v array overflowed a
                   32-bit integer.

     The wwrriitteevv() function call appeared in 4.2BSD. A wwrriittee function call ap-
     peared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.
