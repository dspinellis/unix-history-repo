     The real and effective user IDs of the current process are set according
     to the arguments.  If _r_u_i_d or _e_u_i_d is -1, the current uid is filled in by
     the system.  Unprivileged users may change the real user ID to the effec-
     tive user ID and vice-versa; only the super-user may make other changes.

     The sseettrreeuuiidd() function has been used to swap the real and effective user
     IDs in set-user-ID programs to temporarily relinquish the set-user-ID
     value.  This purpose is now better served by the use of the sseetteeuuiidd()
     function (see setuid(2)).

     When setting the real and effective user IDs to the same value, the stan-
     dard sseettuuiidd() function is preferred.

     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the error.

     [EPERM]  The current process is not the super-user and a change other
              than changing the effective user-id to the real user-id was
              specified.
