       _P_t_r_a_c_e provides a means by which a parent process may con-
       trol the execution of a child  process,  and  examine  and
       change  its core image.  Its primary use is for the imple-
       mentation of breakpoint debugging.  There are  four  argu-
       ments  whose interpretation depends on a _r_e_q_u_e_s_t argument.
       Generally, _p_i_d is the process ID of  the  traced  process,
       which  must be a child (no more distant descendant) of the
       tracing process.  A process being traced behaves  normally
       until  it encounters some signal whether internally gener-
       ated like "illegal instruction"  or  externally  generated
       like  "interrupt".   See _s_i_g_v_e_c(2) for the list.  Then the
       traced process enters a stopped state and  its  parent  is
       notified  via  _w_a_i_t(2).   When the child is in the stopped
       state, its core image can be examined and  modified  using
       _p_t_r_a_c_e.  If desired, another _p_t_r_a_c_e request can then cause
       the child either to terminate  or  to  continue,  possibly
       ignoring the signal.

       The  value  of the _r_e_q_u_e_s_t argument determines the precise
       action of the call:

       PT_TRACE_ME
           This request is the only one used by  the  child  pro-
           cess;  it declares that the process is to be traced by
           its parent.  All  the  other  arguments  are  ignored.
           Peculiar  results  will  ensue  if the parent does not
           expect to trace the child.

       PT_READ_I, PT_READ_D
           The word in the child process's address space at  _a_d_d_r
           is  returned.   If  I  and D space are separated (e.g.
           historically on a pdp-11), request PT_READ_I indicates
           I space, PT_READ_D D space.  _A_d_d_r must be even on some
           machines.  The child must be stopped.  The input  _d_a_t_a
           is ignored.

       PT_READ_U
           The  word of the system's per-process data area corre-
           sponding to _a_d_d_r is returned.  _A_d_d_r must  be  even  on

           some  machines and less than 512.  This space contains
           the registers and other information about the process;
           its  layout  corresponds  to the _u_s_e_r structure in the
           system.

       PT_WRITE_I, PT_WRITE_D
           The given _d_a_t_a is written at the word in the process's
           address  space  corresponding  to  _a_d_d_r_, which must be
           even on some machines.  No useful value  is  returned.
           If  I  and  D  space are separated, request PT_WRITE_I
           indicates I space, PT_WRITE_D D  space.   Attempts  to
           write  in  pure  procedure  fail if another process is
           executing the same file.

       PT_WRITE_U
           The process's system data is written, as  it  is  read
           with  request  PT_READ_U.  Only a few locations can be
           written in this way: the general registers, the float-
           ing  point  status  and registers, and certain bits of
           the processor status word.

       PT_CONTINUE
           The _d_a_t_a argument is taken as a signal number and  the
           child's  execution continues at location _a_d_d_r as if it
           had incurred that signal.  Normally the signal  number
           will  be  either  0  to  indicate that the signal that
           caused the stop  should  be  ignored,  or  that  value
           fetched  out  of  the process's image indicating which
           signal caused the stop.  If _a_d_d_r is (int *)1 then exe-
           cution continues from where it stopped.

       PT_KILL
           The traced process terminates.

       PT_STEP
           Execution  continues  as  in request PT_CONTINUE; how-
           ever, as soon as possible after execution of at  least
           one  instruction,  execution  stops again.  The signal
           number from the stop is SIGTRAP.  (On the  VAX-11  the
           T-bit  is  used and just one instruction is executed.)
           This is part of the mechanism for implementing  break-
           points.

       PT_ATTACH
           The  process  indicated  by  _p_i_d is re-parented to the
           calling process and delivered a SIGSTOP  signal.   The
           child  process may then be traced by the parent, as in
           PT_TRACE_ME.  A process already being traced cannot be
           attached to.

           If  the  calling process is not owned by root, it must

           have the same real user ID as the target  process  and
           not have used set user or group priviledges.

       PT_DETACH
           The  process indicated by _p_i_d is detached from tracing
           and continues its execution.  The process, which  must
           be  a  traced child of the caller, is re-parented with
           the parent it had before tracing began.  The _d_a_t_a  and
           _a_d_d_r arguments behave as in PT_CONTINUE.

       As indicated, these calls (except for request PT_TRACE_ME)
       can be used only when the  subject  process  has  stopped.
       The  _w_a_i_t  call is used to determine when a process stops;
       in such a case the "termination" status returned  by  _w_a_i_t
       has  the  value 0177 to indicate stoppage rather than gen-
       uine termination.

       To forestall possible fraud, _p_t_r_a_c_e inhibits the set-user-
       id  and  set-group-id  facilities  on subsequent _e_x_e_c_v_e(2)
       calls.  If a traced process calls  _e_x_e_c_v_e,  it  will  stop
       before  executing  the  first instruction of the new image
       showing signal SIGTRAP.

       On a VAX-11, "word" also means a 32-bit integer,  but  the
       "even" restriction does not apply.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEE
       A  0  value is returned if the call succeeds.  If the call
       fails then a -1 is returned and the global variable  _e_r_r_n_o
       is set to indicate the error.

BBUUGGSS
       _P_t_r_a_c_e  is unique and arcane; it should be replaced with a
       special file that can be opened and read and written.  The
       control  functions could then be implemented with _i_o_c_t_l(2)
       calls on this file.  This would be simpler  to  understand
       and have much better performance.

       The  request  PT_TRACE_ME  call  should be able to specify
       signals that are to be treated normally and  not  cause  a
       stop.   In  this way, for example, programs with simulated
       floating point (which use "illegal instruction" signals at
       a very high rate) could be efficiently debugged.

       The  error indication, -1, is a legitimate function value;
       _e_r_r_n_o_, (see _i_n_t_r_o(2)), can be used to disambiguate.

       It should be possible to stop a process on occurrence of a
       system  call; in this way a completely controlled environ-
       ment could be provided.

       PT_STEP is not supported on all architectures.  For  exam-
       ple,  the  SPARC  architecture  does not have a trace bit,
       which complicates single instruction stepping.   Debuggers
       and the like can emulate PT_STEP by placing breakpoints at
       all possible locations of the next instruction.
