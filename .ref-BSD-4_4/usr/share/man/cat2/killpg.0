     KKiillllppgg() sends the signal _s_i_g to the process group _p_g_r_p. See sigaction(2)
     for a list of signals.  If _p_g_r_p is 0, kkiillllppgg() sends the signal to the
     sending process's process group.

     The sending process and members of the process group must have the same
     effective user ID, or the sender must be the super-user.  As a single
     special case the continue signal SIGCONT may be sent to any process that
     is a descendant of the current process.

     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and the global variable _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the
     error.

     KKiillllppgg() will fail and no signal will be sent if:

     [EINVAL]      _S_i_g is not a valid signal number.

     [ESRCH]       No process can be found in the process group specified by
                   _p_g_r_p.

     [ESRCH]       The process group was given as 0 but the sending process
                   does not have a process group.

     [EPERM]       The sending process is not the super-user and one or more
                   of the target processes has an effective user ID different
                   from that of the sending process.
