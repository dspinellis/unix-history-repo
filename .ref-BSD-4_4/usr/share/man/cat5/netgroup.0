     The nneettggrroouupp file specifies ``netgroups'', which are sets of ((hhoosstt,, uusseerr,,
     ddoommaaiinn)) tuples that are to be given similar network access.

     Each line in the file consists of a netgroup name followed by a list of
     the members of the netgroup.  Each member can be either the name of an-
     other netgroup or a specification of a tuple as follows:

           (host, user, domain)
     where the hhoosstt, uusseerr, and ddoommaaiinn are character string names for the cor-
     responding component.  Any of the comma separated fields may be empty to
     specify a ``wildcard'' value or may consist of the string ``-'' to speci-
     fy ``no valid value''.  The members of the list may be separated by
     whitespace and/or commas; the ``\'' character may be used at the end of a
     line to specify line continuation.  The functions specified in getnet-
     grent(3) should normally be used to access the nneettggrroouupp database.

     Lines that begin with a # are treated as comments.

     The file format is compatible with that of various vendors, however it
     appears that not all vendors use an identical format.

BBUUGGSS
     The interpretation of access restrictions based of the member tuples of a
     netgroup is left up to the various network applications.  Also, it is not
     obvious how the domain specification applies to the BSD environment.
