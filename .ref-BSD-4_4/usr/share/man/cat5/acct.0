     The kernel maintains the following _a_c_c_t information structure for all
     processes. If a process terminates, and accounting is enabled, the kernel
     calls the acct(2) function call to prepare and append the record to the
     accounting file.

      * Accounting structures; these use a comp_t type which is a 3 bits base 8
      * exponent, 13 bit fraction ``floating point'' number.  Units are 1/AHZ

     If a terminated process was created by an execve(2),  the name of the ex-
     ecuted file (at most ten characters of it) is saved in the field _a_c___c_o_m_m
     and its status is saved by setting one of more of the following flags in
     _a_c___f_l_a_g_: AFORK, ASU, ACOMPAT, ACORE and ASIG.
