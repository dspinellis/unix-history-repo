     A small number of signals which cause abnormal termination of a process
     also cause a record of the process's in-core state to be written to disk
     for later examination by one of the aviailable debuggers.  (See
     sigaction(2).)  This memory image is written to a file named ccoorree in the
     working directory; provided the terminated process had write permission
     in the directory, and provided the abnormality did not caused a system
     crash.  (In this event, the decision to save the core file is arbitrary,
     see savecore(8).)

     The maximum size of a ccoorree file is limited by setrlimit(2).  Files which
     would be larger than the limit are not created.

     The ccoorree file consists of the _u. area, whose size (in pages) is defined
     by the UPAGES manifest in the <_s_y_s_/_p_a_r_a_m_._h> file.  The _u. area starts
     with a _u_s_e_r structure as given in <_s_y_s_/_u_s_e_r_._h>. The remainder of the ccoorree
     file consists of the data pages followed by the stack pages of the pro-
     cess image.  The amount of data space image in the ccoorree file is given (in
     pages) by the variable _u___d_s_i_z_e in the _u. area.  The amount of stack image
     in the core file is given (in pages) by the variable _u___s_s_i_z_e in the _u.
     area.  The size of a ``page'' is given by the constant NBPG (also from
     <_s_y_s_/_p_a_r_a_m_._h>).
