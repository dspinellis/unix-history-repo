     The ggeettttyyttaabb file is a simplified version of the termcap(5) data base
     used to describe terminal lines.  The initial terminal login process get-
     ty(8) accesses the ggeettttyyttaabb file each time it starts, allowing simpler
     reconfiguration of terminal characteristics.  Each entry in the data base
     is used to describe one class of terminals.

     There is a default terminal class, _d_e_f_a_u_l_t, that is used to set global
     defaults for all other classes.  (That is, the _d_e_f_a_u_l_t entry is read,
     then the entry for the class required is used to override particular set-
     tings.)

     Refer to termcap(5) for a description of the file layout.  The _d_e_f_a_u_l_t
     column below lists defaults obtained if there is no entry in the table
     obtained, nor one in the special _d_e_f_a_u_l_t table.

     If no line speed is specified, speed will not be altered from that which
     prevails when getty is entered.  Specifying an input or output speed will
     override line speed for stated direction only.

     Terminal modes to be used for the output of the message, for input of the
     login name, and to leave the terminal set as upon completion, are derived
     from the boolean flags specified.  If the derivation should prove inade-
     quate, any (or all) of these three may be overriden with one of the _f_0,
     _f_1, or _f_2 numeric specifications, which can be used to specify (usually
     in octal, with a leading '0') the exact values of the flags.  Local (new
     tty) flags are set in the top 16 bits of this (32 bit) value.

     Should getty receive a null character (presumed to indicate a line break)
     it will restart using the table indicated by the _n_x entry. If there is
     none, it will re-use its original table.

     Delays are specified in milliseconds, the nearest possible delay avail-
     able in the tty driver will be used.  Should greater certainty be de-
     sired, delays with values 0, 1, 2, and 3 are interpreted as choosing that
     particular delay algorithm from the driver.

     The _c_l screen clear string may be preceded by a (decimal) number of mil-
     liseconds of delay required (a la termcap).  This delay is simulated by
     repeated use of the pad character _p_c.

     The initial message, and login message, _i_m and _l_m may include the charac-
     ter sequence _%_h or _%_t to obtain the hostname or tty name respectively.
     (_%_% obtains a single '%' character.)  The hostname is normally obtained
     from the system, but may be set by the _h_n table entry.  In either case it
     may be edited with _h_e. The _h_e string is a sequence of characters, each
     character that is neither '@' nor '#' is copied into the final hostname.
     A '@' in the _h_e string, causes one character from the real hostname to be
     copied to the final hostname.  A '#' in the _h_e string, causes the next
     character of the real hostname to be skipped.  Surplus '@' and '#' char-
     acters are ignored.

     When getty execs the login process, given in the _l_o string (usually
     ``_/_u_s_r_/_b_i_n_/_l_o_g_i_n''), it will have set the enviroment to include the ter-
     minal type, as indicated by the _t_t string (if it exists).  The _e_v string,
     can be used to enter additional data into the environment.  It is a list
     of comma separated strings, each of which will presumably be of the form
     _n_a_m_e_=_v_a_l_u_e.

     If a non-zero timeout is specified, with _t_o, then getty will exit within
     the indicated number of seconds, either having received a login name and
     passed control to login,  or having received an alarm signal, and exited.
     This may be useful to hangup dial in lines.

     Output from getty is even parity unless _o_p is specified.  The _o_p string
     may be specified with _a_p to allow any parity on input, but generate odd
     parity output.  Note: this only applies while getty is being run, termi-
     nal driver limitations prevent a more complete implementation.  Getty
     does not check parity of input characters in RAW mode.

     login(1),  termcap(5),  getty(8).

BBUUGGSS
     The special characters (erase, kill, etc.) are reset to system defaults
     by login(1).  In _a_l_l cases, '#' or '^H' typed in a login name will be
     treated as an erase character, and '@' will be treated as a kill charac-
     ter.

     The delay stuff is a real crock.  Apart form its general lack of flexi-
     bility, some of the delay algorithms are not implemented.  The terminal
     driver should support sane delay settings.

     The _h_e capability is stupid.

     The termcap format is horrid, something more rational should have been
     chosen.
