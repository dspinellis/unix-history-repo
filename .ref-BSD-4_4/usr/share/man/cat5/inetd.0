     IInneettdd should be run at boot time by _/_e_t_c_/_r_c_._l_o_c_a_l (see rc(8)).  It then
     listens for connections on certain internet sockets.  When a connection
     is found on one of its sockets, it decides what service the socket corre-
     sponds to, and invokes a program to service the request.  After the pro-
     gram is finished, it continues to listen on the socket (except in some
     cases which will be described below).  Essentially, iinneettdd allows running
     one daemon to invoke several others, reducing load on the system.

     The options available for iinneettdd::

     --dd      Turns on debugging.

     --RR _r_a_t_e
             Specifies the maximum number of times a service can be invoked in
             one minute; the default is 1000.

     Upon execution, iinneettdd reads its configuration information from a configu-
     ration file which, by default, is _/_e_t_c_/_i_n_e_t_d_._c_o_n_f. There must be an entry
     for each field of the configuration file, with entries for each field
     separated by a tab or a space.  Comments are denoted by a ``#'' at the
     beginning of a line.  There must be an entry for each field.  The fields
     of the configuration file are as follows:

           service name
           socket type
           protocol
           wait/nowait
           user
           server program
           server program arguments

     There are two types of services that iinneettdd can start: standard and TCP-
     MUX.  A standard service has a well-known port assigned to it; it may be
     a service that implements an official Internet standard or is a BSD-
     specific service.  As described in RFC 1078, TCPMUX services are nonstan-
     dard services that do not have a well-known port assigned to them.  They
     are invoked from iinneettdd when a program connects to the ``tcpmux'' well-
     known port and specifies the service name.  This feature is useful for
     adding locally-developed servers.

     The _s_e_r_v_i_c_e_-_n_a_m_e entry is the name of a valid service in the file
     _/_e_t_c_/_s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s. For ``internal'' services (discussed below), the service
     name _m_u_s_t be the official name of the service (that is, the first entry
     in _/_e_t_c_/_s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s). For TCPMUX services, the value of the _s_e_r_v_i_c_e_-_n_a_m_e
     field consists of the string ``tcpmux'' followed by a slash and the lo-
     cally-chosen service name.  The service names listed in _/_e_t_c_/_s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s and
     the name ``help'' are reserved.  Try to choose unique names for your TCP-
     MUX services by prefixing them with your organization's name and suffix-
     ing them with a version number.

     The _s_o_c_k_e_t_-_t_y_p_e should be one of ``stream'', ``dgram'', ``raw'', ``rdm'',
     or ``seqpacket'', depending on whether the socket is a stream, datagram,
     raw, reliably delivered message, or sequenced packet socket.  TCPMUX ser-
     vices must use ``stream''.


     The _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l must be a valid protocol as given in _/_e_t_c_/_p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l_s. Exam-
     ples might be ``tcp'' or ``udp''. TCPMUX services must use ``tcp''.

     The _w_a_i_t_/_n_o_w_a_i_t entry is applicable to datagram sockets only (other sock-
     ets should have a ``nowait'' entry in this space).  If a datagram server
     connects to its peer, freeing the socket so iinneettdd can received further
     messages on the socket, it is said to be a ``multi-threaded'' server, and
     should use the ``nowait'' entry.  For datagram servers which process all
     incoming datagrams on a socket and eventually time out, the server is
     said to be ``single-threaded'' and should use a ``wait'' entry.  Com-
     sat(8) (biff(1))  and talkd(8) are both examples of the latter type of
     datagram server.  Tftpd(8) is an exception; it is a datagram server that
     establishes pseudo-connections.  It must be listed as ``wait'' in order
     to avoid a race; the server reads the first packet, creates a new socket,
     and then forks and exits to allow iinneettdd to check for new service requests
     to spawn new servers.  TCPMUX services must use ``nowait''.

     The _u_s_e_r entry should contain the user name of the user as whom the serv-
     er should run.  This allows for servers to be given less permission than
     root.

     The _s_e_r_v_e_r_-_p_r_o_g_r_a_m entry should contain the pathname of the program which
     is to be executed by iinneettdd when a request is found on its socket.  If
     iinneettdd provides this service internally, this entry should be
     ``internal''.

     The _s_e_r_v_e_r _p_r_o_g_r_a_m _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s should be just as arguments normally are,
     starting with argv[0], which is the name of the program.  If the service
     is provided internally, the word ``internal'' should take the place of
     this entry.

     IInneettdd provides several ``trivial'' services internally by use of routines
     within itself.  These services are ``echo'', ``discard'', ``chargen''
     (character generator), ``daytime'' (human readable time), and ``time''
     (machine readable time, in the form of the number of seconds since mid-
     night, January 1, 1900).  All of these services are tcp based.  For de-
     tails of these services, consult the appropriate RFC from the Network In-
     formation Center.

     IInneettdd rereads its configuration file when it receives a hangup signal,
     SIGHUP. Services may be added, deleted or modified when the configuration
     file is reread.

TTCCPPMMUUXX
     RFC 1078 describes the TCPMUX protocol: ``A TCP client connects to a for-
     eign host on TCP port 1.  It sends the service name followed by a car-
     riage-return line-feed <CRLF>.  The service name is never case sensitive.
     The server replies with a single character indicating positive (+) or
     negative (-) acknowledgment, immediately followed by an optional message
     of explanation, terminated with a <CRLF>.  If the reply was positive, the
     selected protocol begins; otherwise the connection is closed.''  The pro-
     gram is passed the TCP connection as file descriptors 0 and 1.

     If the TCPMUX service name begins with a ``+'', iinneettdd returns the posi-
     tive reply for the program.  This allows you to invoke programs that use
     stdin/stdout without putting any special server code in them.

     The special service name ``help'' causes iinneettdd to list TCPMUX services in
     _i_n_e_t_d_._c_o_n_f.

     Here are several example service entries for the various types of ser-
     vices:

     ftp           stream  tcp   nowait root  /usr/libexec/ftpd       ftpd -l
     ntalk         dgram   udp   wait   root  /usr/libexec/ntalkd     ntalkd
     tcpmux/+date  stream  tcp   nowait guest /bin/date               date
     tcpmux/phonebook stream tcp nowait guest /usr/local/bin/phonebook phonebook

     IInneettdd logs error messages using syslog(3).  Important error messages and
     their explanations are:

     _s_e_r_v_i_c_e/_p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l server failing (looping), service terminated.
     The number of requests for the specified service in the past minute ex-
     ceeded the limit. The limit exists to prevent a broken program or a mali-
     cious user from swamping the system.  This message may occur for several
     reasons: 1) there are lots of hosts requesting the service within a short
     time period, 2) a 'broken' client program is requesting the service too
     frequently, 3) a malicious user is running a program to invoke the ser-
     vice in a 'denial of service' attack, or 4) the invoked service program
     has an error that causes clients to retry quickly.  Use the [--RR] option,
     as described above, to change the rate limit.  Once the limit is reached,
     the service will be reenabled automatically in 10 minutes.


     _s_e_r_v_i_c_e/_p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l: No such user '_u_s_e_r', service ignored

     No entry for _u_s_e_r exists in the _p_a_s_s_w_d file. The first message occurs
     when iinneettdd (re)reads the configuration file. The second message occurs
     when the service is invoked.

     The user or group ID for the entry's _u_s_e_r is invalid.
