     The sshheellllss file contains a list of the shells on the system.  For each
     shell a single line should be present, consisting of the shell's path,
     relative to root.

     A hash mark (``#'') indicates the beginning of a comment; subsequent
     characters up to the end of the line are not interpreted by the routines
     which search the file.  Blank lines are also ignored.
