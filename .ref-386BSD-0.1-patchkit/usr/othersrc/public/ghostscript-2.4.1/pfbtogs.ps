% Convert a PFB file to a Ghostscript font.

% A .pfb file is a sequence of packets.  Each packet starts with byte
% 0x80.  The second byte in the packet gives the type of packet: 1
% means it's a packet of ascii data which should be sent out as is
% (except for translating \r to the appropriate end-of-line
% character(s)); 2 means it's a packet of binary data which should be
% translated into hex; 3 means EOF.  For types 1 and 2, the type byte
% is followed by four bytes giving the length of the packet, least
% significant first.
