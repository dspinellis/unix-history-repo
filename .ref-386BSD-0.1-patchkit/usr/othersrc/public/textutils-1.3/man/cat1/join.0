       This  manual page documents the GNU version of jjooiinn.  jjooiinn
       prints to the standard output a  line  for  each  pair  of
       input  lines,  one  each  from  _f_i_l_e_1 and _f_i_l_e_2, that have
       identical join fields.  Either filename (but not both) can
       be  `-',  meaning  the  standard  input.   _f_i_l_e_1 and _f_i_l_e_2
       should be already sorted in increasing order (not  numeri-
       cally)  on the join fields; unless the -_t option is given,
       they should be sorted ignoring blanks at the start of  the
       line, as ssoorrtt does when given the -_b option.

       The  defaults  are:  the  join field is the first field in
       each line; fields in the input are  separated  by  one  or
       more  blanks,  with  leading  blanks  on the line ignored;
       fields in the output are separated by a space; each output
       line consists of the join field, the remaining fields from
       _f_i_l_e_1, then the remaining fields from _f_i_l_e_2.

       -_a _f_i_l_e-_n_u_m_b_e_r
              Print a line for each unpairable line in file _f_i_l_e-
              _n_u_m_b_e_r  (either  1 or 2), in addition to the normal
              output.

       -_e _s_t_r_i_n_g
              Replace empty output fields (those that are missing
              in the input) with _s_t_r_i_n_g.

       -_1, -_j_1 _f_i_e_l_d
              Join on field _f_i_e_l_d (a positive integer) of file 1.

       -_2, -_j_2 _f_i_e_l_d
              Join on field _f_i_e_l_d (a positive integer) of file 2.

       -_j _f_i_e_l_d
              Equivalent to -_1 _f_i_e_l_d -_2 _f_i_e_l_d.

       -_o _f_i_e_l_d-_l_i_s_t...
              Construct  each output line according to the format
              in _f_i_e_l_d-_l_i_s_t.  Each element in _f_i_e_l_d-_l_i_s_t consists
              of  a  file number (either 1 or 2), a period, and a
              field number (a positive integer).  The elements in
              the list are separated by commas or blanks.  Multi-
              ple _f_i_e_l_d-_l_i_s_t arguments can be given after a  sin-
              gle  -_o  option; the values of all lists given with
              -_o are concatenated together.



                                                                1





JOIN(1L)                                                 JOIN(1L)


       -_t _c_h_a_r
              Use character _c_h_a_r as the input  and  output  field
              separator.

       -_v _f_i_l_e-_n_u_m_b_e_r
              Print a line for each unpairable line in file _f_i_l_e-
              _n_u_m_b_e_r (either 1 or 2), instead of the normal  out-
              put.

       The  long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well
       as `--', for compatibility with previous releases.   Even-
       tually  support  for  `+'  will  be removed, because it is
       incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
