2.0\ Shell\ procedures
.LP
The shell may be used to read and execute commands
contained in a file.
For example,
.DS
	sh file [ args \*(ZZ ]
.DE
calls the shell to read commands from \fIfile.\fP
Such a file is called a \fIcommand procedure\fP
or \fIshell procedure.\fP
Arguments may be supplied with the call
and are referred to in \fIfile\fP
using the positional parameters
\fB$1, $2, \*(ZZ\|.\fR
For example, if the file \fIwg\fP contains
.DS
	who \*(VT grep $1
.DE
then
.DS
	sh wg fred
.DE
is equivalent to
.DS
	who \*(VT grep fred
.DE
.LP
UNIX files have three independent attributes,
\fIread,\fP \fIwrite\fP and \fIexecute.\fP
The UNIX command \fIchmod\fP (1) may be used
to make a file executable.
For example,
.DS
	chmod +x wg
.DE
will ensure that the file \fIwg\fP has execute status.
Following this, the command
.DS
	wg fred
.DE
is equivalent to
.DS
	sh wg fred
.DE
This allows shell procedures and programs
to be used interchangeably.
In either case a new process is created to
run the command.
.LP
As well as providing names for the positional
parameters,
the number of positional parameters in the call
is available as \fB$#\|.\fP
The name of the file being executed
is available as \fB$0\|.\fP
.LP
A special shell parameter \fB$\*(ST\fP
is used to substitute for all positional parameters
except \fB$0\|.\fP
A typical use of this is to provide
some default arguments,
as in,
.DS
	nroff \(miT450 \(mims $\*(ST
.DE
which simply prepends some arguments
to those already given.
.SH
2.1\ Control\ flow\ -\ for
.LP
A frequent use of shell procedures is to loop
through the arguments (\fB$1, $2, \*(ZZ\fR)
executing commands once for each argument.
An example of such a procedure is
\fItel\fP that searches the file
\fB/usr/lib/telnos\fR
that contains lines of the form
.DS
	\*(ZZ
	fred mh0123
	bert mh0789
	\*(ZZ
.DE
The text of \fItel\fP is
.DS
	for i
	do grep $i /usr/lib/telnos; done
.DE
The command
.DS
	tel fred
.DE
prints those lines in \fB/usr/lib/telnos\fR
that contain the string \fIfred\|.\fP
.DS
	tel fred bert
.DE
prints those lines containing \fIfred\fP
followed by those for \fIbert.\fP
.LP
The \fBfor\fP loop notation is recognized by the shell
and has the general form
.DS
	\fBfor\fR \fIname\fR \fBin\fR \fIw1 w2 \*(ZZ\fR
	\fBdo\fR \fIcommand-list\fR
	\fBdone\fR
.DE
A \fIcommand-list\fP is a sequence of one or more
simple commands separated or terminated by a newline or semicolon.
Furthermore, reserved words
like \fBdo\fP and \fBdone\fP are only
recognized following a newline or
semicolon.
\fIname\fP is a shell variable that is set
to the words \fIw1 w2 \*(ZZ\fR in turn each time the \fIcommand-list\fP
following \fBdo\fP
is executed.
If \fBin\fR \fIw1 w2 \*(ZZ\fR
is omitted then the loop
is executed once for each positional parameter;
that is, \fBin\fR \fI$\*(ST\fR is assumed.
.LP
Another example of the use of the \fBfor\fP
loop is the \fIcreate\fP command
whose text is
.DS
	for i do >$i; done
.DE
The command
.DS
	create alpha beta
.DE
ensures that two empty files
\fIalpha\fP and \fIbeta\fP exist
and are empty.
The notation \fI>file\fP may be used on its
own to create or clear the contents of a file.
Notice also that a semicolon (or newline) is required before \fBdone.\fP
.SH
2.2\ Control\ flow\ -\ case
.LP
A multiple way branch is provided for by the
\fBcase\fP notation.
For example,
.DS
	case $# in
	\*(Ca1)	cat \*(AP$1 ;;
	\*(Ca2)	cat \*(AP$2 <$1 ;;
	\*(Ca\*(ST)	echo \\'usage: append [ from ] to\\' ;;
	esac
.DE
is an \fIappend\fP command.
When called
with one argument as
.DS
	append file
.DE
\fB$#\fP is the string \fI1\fP and
the standard input is copied onto the
end of \fIfile\fP
using the \fIcat\fP command.
.DS
	append file1 file2
.DE
appends the contents of \fIfile1\fP
onto \fIfile2.\fP
If the number of arguments supplied to
\fIappend\fP is other than 1 or 2
then a message is printed indicating
proper usage.
.LP
The general form of the \fBcase\fP command
is
.DS
	\fBcase \fIword \fBin
	\*(Ca\fIpattern\|\fB)\ \fIcommand-list\fB\|;;
	\*(Ca\*(ZZ
	\fBesac\fR
.DE
The shell attempts to match
\fIword\fR with each \fIpattern,\fR
in the order in which the patterns
appear.
If a match is found the
associated \fIcommand-list\fP is
executed and execution
of the \fBcase\fP is complete.
Since \*(ST is the pattern that matches any
string it can be used for the default case.
.LP
A word of caution:
no check is made to ensure that only
one pattern matches
the case argument.
The first match found defines the set of commands
to be executed.
In the example below the commands following
the second \*(ST will never be executed.
.DS
	case $# in
	\*(Ca\*(ST) \*(ZZ ;;
	\*(Ca\*(ST) \*(ZZ ;;
	esac
.DE
.LP
Another example of the use of the \fBcase\fP
construction is to distinguish
between different forms
of an argument.
The following example is a fragment of a \fIcc\fP command.
.DS
	for i
	do case $i in
	\*(DC\(mi[ocs])	\*(ZZ ;;
	\*(DC\(mi\*(ST)	echo \\"unknown flag $i\\" ;;
	\*(DC\*(ST.c)	/lib/c0 $i \*(ZZ ;;
	\*(DC\*(ST)	echo \\"unexpected argument $i\\" ;;
	\*(DOesac
	done
.DE
.LP
To allow the same commands to be associated
with more than one pattern
the \fBcase\fP command provides
for alternative patterns
separated by a \*(VT\|.
For example,
.DS
	case $i in
	\*(Ca\(mix\*(VT\(miy)	\*(ZZ
	esac
.DE
is equivalent to
.DS
	case $i in
	\*(Ca\(mi[xy])	\*(ZZ
	esac
.DE
.LP
The usual quoting conventions apply
so that
.DS
	case $i in
	\*(Ca\\\\?)	\*(ZZ
.DE
will match the character \fB?\|.\fP
.SH
2.3\ Here\ documents
.LP
The shell procedure \fItel\fP
in section 2.1 uses the file \fB/usr/lib/telnos\fR
to supply the data
for \fIgrep.\fP
An alternative is to include this
data
within the shell procedure as a \fIhere\fP document, as in,
.DS
	for i
	do grep $i \*(HE!
	\*(DO\*(ZZ
	\*(DOfred mh0123
	\*(DObert mh0789
	\*(DO\*(ZZ
	!
	done
.DE
In this example
the shell takes the lines between \fB\*(HE!\fR and \fB!\fR
as the standard input for \fIgrep.\fP
The string \fB!\fR is arbitrary, the document
being terminated by a line that consists
of the string following \*(HE\|.
.LP
Parameters are substituted in the document
before it is made available to \fIgrep\fP
as illustrated by the following procedure
called \fIedg\|.\fP
.DS
	ed $3 \*(HE%
	g/$1/s//$2/g
	w
	%
.DE
The call
.DS
	edg string1 string2 file
.DE
is then equivalent to the command
.DS
	ed file \*(HE%
	g/string1/s//string2/g
	w
	%
.DE
and changes all occurrences of \fIstring1\fP
in \fIfile\fP to \fIstring2\|.\fP
Substitution can be prevented using \\
to quote the special character \fB$\fP
as in
.DS
	ed $3 \*(HE+
	1,\\\\$s/$1/$2/g
	w
	+
.DE
(This version of \fIedg\fP is equivalent to
the first except that \fIed\fP will print
a \fB?\fR if there are no occurrences of
the string \fB$1\|.\fP)
Substitution within a \fIhere\fP document
may be prevented entirely by quoting
the terminating string,
for example,
.DS
	grep $i \*(HE\\\\#
	\*(ZZ
	#
.DE
The document is presented
without modification to \fIgrep.\fP
If parameter substitution is not required
in a \fIhere\fP document this latter form
is more efficient.
.SH
2.4\ Shell\ variables
.LP
The shell
provides string-valued variables.
Variable names begin with a letter
and consist of letters, digits and
underscores.
Variables may be given values by writing, for example,
.DS
	user=fred\ box=m000\ acct=mh0000
.DE
which assigns values to the variables
\fBuser, box\fP and \fBacct.\fP
A variable may be set to the null string
by saying, for example,
.DS
	null=
.DE
The value of a variable is substituted
by preceding its name with \fB$\|;\fP
for example,
.DS
	echo $user
.DE
will echo \fIfred.\fP
.LP
Variables may be used interactively
to provide abbreviations for frequently
used strings.
For example,
.DS
	b=/usr/fred/bin
	mv pgm $b
.DE
will move the file \fIpgm\fP
from the current directory to the directory \fB/usr/fred/bin\|.\fR
A more general notation is available for parameter
(or variable)
substitution, as in,
.DS
	echo ${user}
.DE
which is equivalent to
.DS
	echo $user
.DE
and is used when the parameter name is
followed by a letter or digit.
For example,
.DS
	tmp=/tmp/ps
	ps a >${tmp}a
.DE
will direct the output of \fIps\fR
to the file \fB/tmp/psa,\fR
whereas,
.DS
	ps a >$tmpa
.DE
would cause the value of the variable \fBtmpa\fP
to be substituted.
.LP
Except for \fB$?\fP the following
are set initially by the shell.
\fB$?\fP is set after executing each command.
.RS
.IP \fB$?\fP 8
The exit status (return code)
of the last command executed
as a decimal string.
Most commands return a zero exit status
if they complete successfully,
otherwise a non-zero exit status is returned.
Testing the value of return codes is dealt with
later under \fBif\fP and \fBwhile\fP commands.
.IP \fB$#\fP 8
The number of positional parameters
(in decimal).
Used, for example, in the \fIappend\fP command
to check the number of parameters.
.IP \fB$$\fP 8
The process number of this shell (in decimal).
Since process numbers are unique among
all existing processes, this string is
frequently used to generate
unique
temporary file names.
For example,
.DS
	ps a >/tmp/ps$$
	\*(ZZ
	rm /tmp/ps$$
.DE
.IP \fB$\|!\fP 8
The process number of the last process
run in the background (in decimal).
.IP \fB$\(mi\fP 8
The current shell flags, such as
\fB\(mix\fR and \fB\(miv\|.\fR
.RE
.LP
Some variables have a special meaning to the
shell and should be avoided for general
use.
.RS
.IP \fB$\s-1MAIL\s0\fP 8
When used interactively
the shell looks at the file
specified by this variable
before it issues a prompt.
If the specified file has been modified
since it
was last looked at the shell
prints the message
\fIyou have mail\fP before prompting
for the next command.
This variable is typically set
in the file \fB.profile,\fP
in the user's login directory.
For example,
.DS
	\s-1MAIL\s0=/usr/spool/mail/fred
.DE
.IP \fB$\s-1HOME\s0\fP 8
The default argument
for the \fIcd\fP command.
The current directory is used to resolve
file name references that do not begin with
a \fB/\|,\fR
and is changed using the \fIcd\fP command.
For example,
.DS
	cd /usr/fred/bin
.DE
makes the current directory \fB/usr/fred/bin\|.\fR
.DS
	cat wn
.DE
will print on the terminal the file \fIwn\fP
in this directory.
The command
\fIcd\fP with no argument
is equivalent to
.DS
	cd $\s-1HOME\s0
.DE
This variable is also typically set in the
the user's login profile.
.IP \fB$\s-1PATH\s0\fP 8
A list of directories that contain commands (the \fIsearch path\fR\|).
Each time a command is executed by the shell
a list of directories is searched
for an executable file.
.ne 5
If \fB$\s-1PATH\s0\fP is not set
then the current directory,
\fB/bin\fP, and \fB/usr/bin\fP are searched by default.
.ne 5
Otherwise \fB$\s-1PATH\s0\fP consists of directory
names separated by \fB:\|.\fP
For example,
.DS
	\s-1PATH\s0=\fB:\fP/usr/fred/bin\fB:\fP/bin\fB:\fP/usr/bin
.DE
specifies that the current directory
(the null string before the first \fB:\fP\|),
\fB/usr/fred/bin, /bin \fRand\fP /usr/bin\fR
are to be searched in that order.
In this way individual users
can have their own `private' commands
that are accessible independently
of the current directory.
If the command name contains a \fB/\fR then this directory search
is not used; a single attempt
is made to execute the command.
.IP \fB$\s-1PS1\s0\fP 8
The primary shell prompt string, by default, `\fB$\ \fR'.
.IP \fB$\s-1PS2\s0\fP 8
The shell prompt when further input is needed,
by default, `\fB>\ \fR'.
.IP \fB$\s-1IFS\s0\fP 8
The set of characters used by \fIblank
interpretation\fR (see section 3.4).
.RE
.SH
2.5\ The\ test\ command
.LP
The \fItest\fP command, although not part of the shell,
is intended for use by shell programs.
For example,
.DS
	test \(mif file
.DE
returns zero exit status if \fIfile\fP
exists and non-zero exit status otherwise.
In general \fItest\fP evaluates a predicate
and returns the result as its exit status.
Some of the more frequently used \fItest\fP
arguments are given here, see \fItest\fP (1)
for a complete specification.
.DS
	test s		true if the argument \fIs\fP is not the null string
	test \(mif file	true if \fIfile\fP exists
	test \(mir file	true if \fIfile\fP is readable
	test \(miw file	true if \fIfile\fP is writable
	test \(mid file	true if \fIfile\fP is a directory
.DE
.SH
2.6\ Control\ flow\ -\ while
.LP
The actions of
the \fBfor\fP loop and the \fBcase\fP
branch are determined by data available to the shell.
A \fBwhile\fP or \fBuntil\fP loop
and an \fBif then else\fP branch
are also provided whose
actions are determined by the exit status
returned by commands.
A \fBwhile\fP loop has the general form
.DS
	\fBwhile\fP \fIcommand-list\*1\fP
	\fBdo\fP \fIcommand-list\*2\fP
	\fBdone\fP
.DE
.LP
The value tested by the \fBwhile\fP command
is the exit status of the last simple command
following \fBwhile.\fP
Each time round the loop
\fIcommand-list\*1\fP is executed;
if a zero exit status is returned then
\fIcommand-list\*2\fP
is executed;
otherwise, the loop terminates.
For example,
.DS
	while test $1
	do \*(ZZ
	\*(DOshift
	done
.DE
is equivalent to
.DS
	for i
	do \*(ZZ
	done
.DE
\fIshift\fP is a shell command that
renames the positional parameters
\fB$2, $3, \*(ZZ\fR as \fB$1, $2, \*(ZZ\fR
and loses \fB$1\|.\fP
.LP
Another kind of use for the \fBwhile/until\fP
loop is to wait until some
external event occurs and then run
some commands.
In an \fBuntil\fP loop
the termination condition is reversed.
For example,
.DS
	until test \(mif file
	do sleep 300; done
	\fIcommands\fP
.DE
will loop until \fIfile\fP exists.
Each time round the loop it waits for
5 minutes before trying again.
(Presumably another process
will eventually create the file.)
.SH
2.7\ Control\ flow\ -\ if
.LP
Also available is a
general conditional branch
of the form,
.DS
	\fBif\fP \fIcommand-list
	\fBthen	\fIcommand-list
	\fBelse	\fIcommand-list
	\fBfi\fR
.DE
that tests the value returned by the last simple command
following \fBif.\fP
.LP
The \fBif\fP command may be used
in conjunction with the \fItest\fP command
to test for the existence of a file as in
.DS
	if test \(mif file
	then	\fIprocess file\fP
	else	\fIdo something else\fP
	fi
.DE
.LP
An example of the use of \fBif, case\fP
and \fBfor\fP constructions is given in
section 2.10\|.
.LP
A multiple test \fBif\fP command
of the form
.DS
	if \*(ZZ
	then	\*(ZZ
	else	if \*(ZZ
		then	\*(ZZ
		else	if \*(ZZ
			\*(ZZ
			fi
		fi
	fi
.DE
may be written using an extension of the \fBif\fP
notation as,
.DS
	if \*(ZZ
	then	\*(ZZ
	elif	\*(ZZ
	then	\*(ZZ
	elif	\*(ZZ
	\*(ZZ
	fi
.DE
.LP
The following example is the \fItouch\fP command
which changes the `last modified' time for a list
of files.
The command may be used in conjunction
with \fImake\fP (1) to force recompilation of a list
of files.
.DS
	flag=
	for i
	do case $i in
	\*(DC\(mic)	flag=N ;;
	\*(DC\*(ST)	if test \(mif $i
	\*(DC	then	ln $i junk$$; rm junk$$
	\*(DC	elif test $flag
	\*(DC	then	echo file \\\\\'$i\\\\\' does not exist
	\*(DC	else	>$i
	\*(DC	fi
	\*(DO esac
	done
.DE
The \fB\(mic\fP flag is used in this command to
force subsequent files to be created if they do not already exist.
Otherwise, if the file does not exist, an error message is printed.
The shell variable \fIflag\fP
is set to some non-null string if the \fB\(mic\fP
argument is encountered.
The commands
.DS
	ln \*(ZZ; rm \*(ZZ
.DE
make a link to the file and then remove it
thus causing the last modified date to be updated.
.LP
The sequence
.DS
	if command1
	then	command2
	fi
.DE
may be written
.DS
	command1 && command2
.DE
Conversely,
.DS
	command1 \*(VT\*(VT command2
.DE
executes \fIcommand2\fP only if \fIcommand1\fP
fails.
In each case the value returned
is that of the last simple command executed.
.SH
2.8\ Command\ grouping
.LP
Commands may be grouped in two ways,
.DS
	\fB{\fI command-list\fB ; }\fR
.DE
and
.DS
	\fB(\fI command-list\fB )\fR
.DE
.LP
In the first \fIcommand-list\fP is simply executed.
The second form executes \fIcommand-list\fP
as a separate process.
For example,
.DS
	(cd x; rm junk )
.DE
executes \fIrm junk\fP in the directory
\fBx\fP without changing the current
directory of the invoking shell.
.LP
The commands
.DS
	cd x; rm junk
.DE
have the same effect but leave the invoking
shell in the directory \fBx.\fP
.SH
2.9\ Debugging\ shell\ procedures
.LP
The shell provides two tracing mechanisms
to help when debugging shell procedures.
The first is invoked within the procedure
as
.DS
	set \(miv
.DE
(\fBv\fP for verbose) and causes lines of the
procedure to be printed as they are read.
It is useful to help isolate syntax errors.
It may be invoked without modifying the procedure
by saying
.DS
	sh \(miv proc \*(ZZ
.DE
where \fIproc\fP is the name of the shell procedure.
This flag may be used in conjunction
with the \fB\(min\fP flag which prevents
execution of subsequent commands.
(Note that saying \fIset \(min\fP at a terminal
will render the terminal useless
until an end-of-file is typed.)
.LP
The command
.DS
	set \(mix
.DE
will produce an execution
trace.
Following parameter substitution
each command is printed as it is executed.
(Try these at the terminal to see
what effect they have.)
Both flags may be turned off by saying
.DS
	set \(mi
.DE
and the current setting of the shell flags is available as \fB$\(mi\|.\fR
.SH
2.10\ The\ man\ command
.LP
The following is the \fIman\fP command
which is used to diplay sections of the UNIX manual on your terminal.
It is called, for example, as
.DS
		man sh
		man \(mit ed
		man 2 fork
.DE
In the first the manual section for \fIsh\fP
is displayed..
Since no section is specified, section 1 is used.
The second example will typeset (\fB\(mit\fP option)
the manual section for \fIed.\fP
The last prints the \fIfork\fP manual page
from section 2, which covers system calls.
