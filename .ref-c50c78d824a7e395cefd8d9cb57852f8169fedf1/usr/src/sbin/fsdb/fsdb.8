.SH DESCRIPTION
Since
.I fsdb
reads the disk raw,
it is able to circumvent normal
file system security.
Extreme caution is advised
in determining its availability
on the system.
Suggested permissions are 600
and owned by bin.
.PP
.I Fsdb\^
can be used
to patch up 
a damaged file system
after a crash.
It has conversions
to translate block and i-numbers
into their corresponding disk addresses.
Also included are mnemonic offsets
to access different parts
of an inode.
These greatly simplify the process
of correcting control block entries
or descending the file system tree.
.PP
.I Fsdb\^
contains several error-checking routines
to verify inode and block addresses.
These can be disabled if necessary 
by invoking 
.I fsdb\^
with the
.IR \-o
option
or by the use of the
.IR o
command.
.PP
.I Fsdb\^
reads a block at a time
and will therefore work with raw as well as block
I/O. 
A buffer management routine 
is used to retain commonly used
blocks of data
in order to reduce the number of read system calls.
All assignment operations result
in an immediate write-through
of the corresponding block.
Note that in order to modify
any portion of the disk,
.IR fsdb
must be invoked with the
.IR -w
option.
.PP
Wherever possible,
.IR adb- like
syntax was adopted
to promote the use
of
.IR fsdb
through familiarity.
.PP
Numbers are considered hexadecimal by default.
However, the user has control over how data is
to be displayed
or accepted.
The
.IR base
command will display
or set the input/output base.
Once set,
all input will default to this base
and all output will be shown in this base.
The base can be overriden temporarily for input by
preceding hexadecimal numbers with '0x', preceding
decimal numbers with '0t', or
octal numbers with '0'.
Hexadecimal numbers beginning with a-f or A-F must
be preceded with '0x'
to distinguish them from commands.
.PP
Disk addressing by
.IR fsdb
is at the byte level.
However,
.IR fsdb
offers many commands to convert
a desired inode, directory entry,
block, superblock etc. to a
byte address.
Once the address has been calculated,
.IR fsdb
will record the result in
.IR dot
(see next paragraph).
.PP
Several global values are maintained by
.IR fsdb :
the current base (referred to as
.IR base ),
the current address (referred to as
.IR dot ),
the current inode (referred to as
.IR inode ),
the current count (referred to as
.IR count ),
and the current type (referred to as
.IR type ).
Most commands use the preset value of
.IR dot
in
their execution.
For example,
.RS
.PD 0
.TP 7.2n
> 2:inode
.PD
.RE
will first set the value of
.IR dot
to 2, ':' will alert the start of a command,
and the
.IR inode
command will set
.IR inode
to 2.
A count is specified after a ','.
Once set,
.IR count
will remain at this value
until a new command is encountered
which will then reset the value back to 1 (the default).
So, if
.RS
.PD 0
.TP 7.2n
> 2000,400/X
.PD
.RE
is typed,
400 hex longs are listed
from 2000,
and when completed,
the value of
.IR dot
will be 2000 + 400 * sizeof (long).
If a carriage-return is then typed,
the output routine will use the
current values of
.IR dot ,
.IR count ,
and
.IR type
and display 400 more hex longs.
A '*' will cause the entire block to
be displayed.
.PP
End of fragment, block and file are maintained by
.IR fsdb.
When displaying data as fragments or blocks,
an error message will be displayed when the end of fragment
or block is reached.
When displaying data using the
.IR db,
.IR ib,
.IR directory,
or
.IR file
commands an error message is displayed if the
end of file is reached.
This is mainly needed
to avoid passing the
end of a directory or file
and getting unknown and unwanted results.
.PP
An example showing several commands and
the use of carriage-return would be:
.RS
.PD 0
.TP 7.2n
> 2:ino; 0:dir?d
.br
or
.PD
.RE
.RS
.PD 0
.TP 7.2n
> 2:ino; 0:db:block?d
.PD
.RE
The two examples are synonymous for getting to the first
directory entry of the root of the file system.
Once there,
subsequent carriage-returns (or +, -) will advance to subsequent
entries.
Note that
.RS
.PD 0
.TP 7.2n
> 2:inode; :ls
.br
or
.PD
.RE
.RS
.PD 0
.TP 7.2n
> :ls /
.PD
.RE
is again synonymous.
.SH EXPRESSIONS
.PP
The symbols recognized by
.I fsdb\^
are:
.TP 7.2n
.B carriage-return
update the value of
.IR dot
by the current value of
.IR type
and display using the current value of
.IR count .
.TP 7.2n
.B #
numeric expressions may be composed of +, -, *, and % operators
(evaluated left to right) and may use parentheses.  Once evaluated,
the value of
.IR dot
is updated.
.TP 7.2n
.BI , " count"\^
count indicator.  The global value of
.IR count
will be updated to 
.IR count .
The value of
.IR count
will remain until a new command is run.
A count specifier of '*' will attempt to show a
.IR blocks's
worth of information.
The default for
.IR count
is 1.
.TP 7.2n
.BI ? " f\^"
display in structured style with format
specifier
.IR f
(see FORMATTED OUTPUT section).
.TP 7.2n
.BI / " f\^"
display in unstructured style with format
specifier
.IR f
(see FORMATTED OUTPUT section).
.TP 7.2n
.B .
the value of
.IR dot .
.TP 7.2n
.BI + "e\^"
increment the value of
.IR dot
by the expression
.IR e.
The amount actually incremented is dependent
on the size of
.IR type :
.br
.nf
     dot = dot + e * sizeof (type)
.fi
The default for
.IR e
is 1.
.TP 7.2n
.BI - "e\^"
decrement the value of
.IR dot
by the expression
.IR e
(see +).
.TP 7.2n
.BI * "e\^"
multiply the value of
.IR dot
by the expression
.IR e.
Multiplication and division don't
use
.IR type.
In the above calculation of
.IR dot ,
consider the
sizeof (
.IR type )
to be 1.
.TP 7.2n
.BI % "e\^"
divide the value of
.IR dot
by the expression
.IR e
(see *).
.TP 7.2n
.BI < " name\^"
restore an address saved in register
.IR name .
.IR name
must be a single letter or digit.
.TP 7.2n
.BI > " name\^"
save an address in register
.IR name .
.IR name
must be a single letter or digit.
.TP 7.2n
.BI = " f"
display indicator.
If
.IR f
is a legitimate format specifier
(see FORMATTED OUTPUT
section),
then the value of
.IR dot
is displayed using
format specifier
.IR f .
Otherwise,
assignment is assumed
(see next item).
.TP 7.2n
.BI = " [s] [e]\^"
assignment indicator.
The address pointed to by
.IR dot
has its contents changed to the value of the
expression
.IR e
or to the
.IR ASCII
representation of the
quoted (") string
.IR s.
This may be useful for changing
directory names or
.IR ASCII
file information.
.TP 7.2n
.BI =+ " e\^"
incremental assignment.
The address pointed to by
.IR dot
has its contents incremented by expression
.IR e .
.TP 7.2n
.BI =- " e\^"
decremental assignment.
The address pointed to by
.IR dot
has its contents decremented by expression
.IR e .
.SH COMMANDS
.PP
A command must be prefixed by a ':' character.
Only enough letters of the command
to uniquely
distinguish it are needed.
Multiple commands may be entered
on one line by separating
them by a space, tab or ';'.
.PP
In order to view a potentially
unmounted disk in a reasonable
manner,
.I fsdb\^
offers the
.IR cd ,
.IR pwd ,
.IR ls
and
.IR find
commands.
The functionality of these
commands substantially matches those of
its
.IR UNIX
counterparts
(see individual command for details).
The '*', '?', and '[-]' wild card
characters are available.
.TP 7.2n
.BI base=b
display or set base.  As stated above,
all input and output is governed by
the current
.IR base .
If the '=b' is left off,
the current
.IR base
is displayed.
Otherwise, the current
.IR base
is set
to
.IR b.
Note that this is interpreted
using the old value of
.IR base ,
so to ensure correctness use the '0', '0t', or '0x'
prefix when changing the
.IR base.
The default for
.IR base
is hexadecimal.
.TP 7.2n
.B block
convert the value of
.IR dot
to a block address.
.TP 7.2n
.B cd dir
change the current directory
to directory
.IR dir.
The current values of
.IR inode
and
.IR dot
are also updated.
If no
.IR dir
is specified,
then change directories to
inode 2 ("/").
.TP 7.2n
.B cg
convert the value of
.IR dot
to a cylinder group.
.TP 7.2n
.B directory
If the current
.IR inode
is a directory,
then the value of
.IR dot
is converted to a directory
slot offset in that directory
and
.IR dot
now points to
this entry.
.TP 7.2n
.B file
the value of
.IR dot
is taken as
a relative block count from the
beginning of the file.
The value of
.IR dot
is updated to the first byte
of this block.
.IR
.TP 7.2n
.BI find " dir [-name n] [-inum i]\^"
find files by name or i-number.
.IR find
recursively searches
directory
.IR dir
and below for filenames whose
i-number matches
.IR i
or whose name
matches pattern
.IR n .
Note that only one of the two options
(-name or -inum)
may be used at one time.
Also, the -print is not needed or
accepted.
.TP 7.2n
.BI fill "=p\^"
fill an area of disk with pattern
.IR p.
The area of disk
is delimited by
.IR dot
and
.IR count .
.TP 7.2n
.B fragment
convert the value of
.IR dot
to
a fragment address.
The only difference between the
.IR fragment
command and the
.IR block
command is the amount that
is able to be displayed.
.TP 7.2n
.B inode
convert the value of
.IR dot
to an inode address.
If successful,
the current value of
.IR inode
will be updated as well as
the value of
.IR dot.
As a convenient shorthand,
if ':inode' appears at the
beginning of the line,
the value of
.IR dot
is set to the current
.IR inode
and that inode is displayed
in inode format.
.TP 7.2n
.BI ls " [-R] [-l] pat1 pat2 ...\^"
list directories or files.
If no file is specified,
the current directory is assumed.
Either or both of the
options may be used (but, if used,
.IR must
be specified before the
filename specifiers).
Also, as stated above,
wild card characters are
available and multiple
arguments may be given.
The long listing shows only
the i-number and the name;
use the
.IR inode
command with '?i'
to get more information.
.TP 7.2n
.B override
toggle the value of override.
Some error conditions may be
overriden
if override is toggled on.
.TP 7.2n
.BI prompt " p\^"
change the fsdb prompt to
.IR p.
.IR p
must be surrounded by (")s.
.TP 7.2n
.B pwd
display the current working directory.
.TP 7.2n
.B quit
quit
.IR fsdb .
.TP 7.2n
.B sb
the value of
.IR dot
is taken as a cylinder group
number and then converted to
the address of the superblock
in that cylinder group.
As a shorthand, ':sb' at
the beginning of a line
will set the value of
.IR dot
to 
.IR the
superblock and display it
in superblock format.
.TP 7.2n
.B !
escape to shell
.SH INODE COMMANDS
In addition to the above commands,
there are several commands that deal with inode
fields and operate directly on the current
.IR inode
(they still require the ':').
They may be used to more easily display
or change the particular fields.
The value of
.IR dot
is only used by the ':db'
and ':ib' commands.
Upon completion of the command,
the value of
.IR dot
is changed to point to
that particular field.
For example,
.RS
.PD 0
.TP 7.2n
> :ln=+1
.PD
.RE
would
increment the link count of the current
.IR inode
and set the value of
.IR dot
to the address of the link
count field.
.TP 7.2n
.B at
access time.
.TP 7.2n
.B bs
block size.
.TP 7.2n
.B ct
creation time.
.TP 7.2n
.B db
use the current value of
.IR dot
as a direct block index,
where direct blocks number from
0 - 11.
In order to display the block
itself, you need to 'pipe' this
result into the
.IR block
or
.IR fragment
command.
For example,
.br
.nf
     > 1:db:block,20/X
.fi
would get the contents of
data block field 1 from the inode and
convert it to a block address.
20 longs are then displayed in hexadecimal
(see FORMATTED OUTPUT section).
.TP 7.2n
.B gid
group id.
.TP 7.2n
.B ib
use the current value of
.IR dot
as an indirect block index
where indirect blocks number from
0 - 2.
This will only get the indirect block itself
(the block containing the pointers to the actual blocks).
Use the
.IR file
command and start at block 12 to get to the actual
blocks.
.TP 7.2n
.B ln
link count.
.TP 7.2n
.B mt
modification time.
.TP 7.2n
.B md
mode.
.TP 7.2n
.B maj
major device number.
.TP 7.2n
.B min
minor device number.
.TP 7.2n
.B nm
although listed here,
this command actually
operates on the directory
name field.
Once poised at the desired
directory entry (using the
.IR directory
command),
this command will allow
you to change or display
the directory name.
For example,
.br
.nf
     > 7:dir:nm="foo"
.fi
will get the 7th directory
entry of the current
.IR inode
and change its name to foo.
Note that names
cannot be made larger than the
field is set up for.
If an attempt is made,
the string is truncated to fit
and a warning message to this
effect is displayed.
.TP 7.2n
.B sz
file size.
.TP 7.2n
.B uid
user id.
.SH FORMATTED OUTPUT
.PP
There are two styles
and many format types.
The two styles are structured and
unstructured.
Structured output is used to display
inodes, directories, superblocks and the
like.
Unstructured just displays
raw data.
The following table shows the
different ways of displaying:
.TP 7.2n
.B ?
.RS
.PD 0
.TP 13
.B c
display as cylinder groups
.TP 13
.B i
display as inodes
.TP 13
.B d
display as directories
.TP 13
.B s
display as superblocks
.PD
.RE
.TP 7.2n
.B /
.RS
.PD 0
.TP 13
.B b
display as bytes
.TP 13
.B c
display as characters
.TP 13
.B o O
display as octal shorts or longs
.TP 13
.B d D
display as decimal shorts or longs
.TP 13
.B x X
display as hexadecimal shorts or longs
.PD
.RE
.PP
The format specifier immediately follows
the '/' or '?' character.
The values displayed by '/b' and all '?'
formats are displayed in the current
.IR base .
Also,
.IR type
is appropriately updated
upon completion.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP 16
> 2000+400%(20+20)=D
will display 2010 in decimal (use of
.IR fsdb
as a calculator
for complex arithmetic).
.TP 16
> 386:ino?i
display i-number 386 in an inode format.
This now becomes the current
.IR inode .
.TP 16
> :ln=4
changes the link count for the 
current
.IR inode
to 4.
.TP 16
> :ln=+1
increments the link count by 1.
.TP 16
> :ct=X
display the creation time as a hexadecimal long.
.TP 16
> :mt=t
display the modification time in time format.
.TP 16
> 0:file/c
displays, in
.IR ASCII ,
block zero of the file associated
with the
current
.IR inode .
.TP 16
> 2:ino,*?d
displays the first blocks worth of directory entries for
the root inode of this file system.
It will stop prematurely if the eof is reached.
.TP 16
> 5:dir:inode; 0:file,*/c
changes the current inode to that
associated with the 5th directory entry
(numbered from zero)
of the current
.IR inode.
The first logical block of the file
is then displayed in
.IR ASCII .
.TP 16
> :sb
displays the superblock of this file system.
.TP 16
> 1:cg?c
displays cylinder group information and summary
for cylinder group 1.
.TP 16
> 2:inode; 7:dir=3
changes the i-number for the 
seventh directory slot in the root directory to 3.
.TP 16
> 7:dir:nm="name"
changes the name field
in the directory slot to
.IR name .
.TP 16
> 2:db:block,*?d
displays the third block of the current
.IR inode
as directory entries.
.TP 16
> 3c3:fragment,20:fill=0x20
get fragment 3c3 and fill 20
.IR type
elements
with 0x20.
.TP 16
> 2050=0xffff
set the contents of address 2050 to 0xffffffff.
0xffffffff may be truncated depending on the current
.IR type.
.TP 16
> 1c92434="this is some text"
will place the
.IR ASCII
for the string at
1c92434.
