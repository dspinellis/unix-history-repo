Although Fortran is not a pleasant
language to use,
it does have the advantages of universality
and (usually) relative efficiency.
The
Ratfor 
language attempts to conceal
the main deficiencies of Fortran
while retaining its desirable qualities,
by providing
decent control flow statements:
.IP "\ \ \ \(bu"
statement grouping
.IP "\ \ \ \(bu"
.UL if-else
and
.UL switch
for decision-making
.IP "\ \ \ \(bu"
.UL while ,
.UL for ,
.UL do ,
and
.UL repeat-until
for looping
.IP "\ \ \ \(bu"
.UL break
and
.UL next
for controlling loop exits
.LP
and some ``syntactic sugar'':
.IP "\ \ \ \(bu"
free form input (multiple statements/line, automatic continuation)
.IP "\ \ \ \(bu"
unobtrusive comment convention
.IP "\ \ \ \(bu"
translation of >, >=, etc., into .GT., .GE., etc.
.IP "\ \ \ \(bu"
.UL return (expression)
statement for functions
.IP "\ \ \ \(bu"
.UL define
statement for symbolic parameters
.IP "\ \ \ \(bu"
.UL include
statement for including source files
.LP
Ratfor
is implemented as a
preprocessor which translates this language
into Fortran.
.PP
Once the control flow and cosmetic deficiencies of Fortran
are hidden,
the resulting language is remarkably pleasant to use.
Ratfor 
programs are
markedly easier to write, and to read,
and thus easier to debug, maintain and modify
than their Fortran equivalents.
.PP
It is readily possible to write 
Ratfor 
programs which are portable to other env ironments.
Ratfor
is written in itself
in this way,
so it is also portable;
versions of 
Ratfor 
are now running on at least two dozen different types of computers
at over five hundred locations.

This paper discusses design criteria

the 
Ratfor
language
and its implementation,
and user experience.
