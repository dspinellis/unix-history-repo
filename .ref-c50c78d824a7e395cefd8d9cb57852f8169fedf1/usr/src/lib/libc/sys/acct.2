.SH NAME
acct \- turn accounting on or off
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
acct(file)
char *file;
.ft R
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The system is prepared to write a record
in an accounting
.I file
for each process as it terminates.
This
call, with a null-terminated string naming an existing file
as argument, turns on accounting;
records for each terminating process are appended to
.IR file .
An argument of 0 causes accounting to be turned off.
.PP
The accounting file format is given in
.IR acct (5).
.PP
This call is permitted only to the super-user.
.SH NOTES
Accounting is automatically disabled when the file system the
accounting file resides on runs out of space; it is enabled when
space once again becomes available.
.SH "RETURN VALUE
On error \-1 is returned.
The file must exist and the call may be exercised only by the super-user.
It is erroneous to try to turn on accounting when it is already on.

will fail if one of the following is true:

accounted for.
