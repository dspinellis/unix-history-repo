.SH NAME
cons, CP, remote \- Tahoe console interface
.SH DESCRIPTION
The console is available to the processor through the console registers.
It acts like a normal terminal, except that a ``~'' is used to transfer
commands to the console processor when the front panel key switch is
in the ``foo'' or ``bar'' position.
.PP
Useful commands to the console processor include ``~h'' to halt
the machine and ``~b'' to force a reboot.  When the console processor
is in control, a ``#>'' prompt is displayed.  To continue execution
after halting the machine with ``~h'', use ``r.''.
Refer to the Tahoe
console processor handbook for the complete list of facilities available
through the console processor.
.PP
The
.I CP
device provides direct access to the console processor.  The
.I remote
device is a secondary console terminal used for remote diagnosis;
it is normally connected to a modem.
