.TH SLEEP 3 
.SH NAME
sleep \- suspend execution for interval
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sleep(seconds)
.br
.B unsigned seconds;
.SH DESCRIPTION
The current process is suspended from execution for the number
of seconds specified by the argument.
The actual suspension time may be up to 1 second less than
that requested, because scheduled wakeups occur at fixed 1-second intervals,
and an arbitrary amount longer because of other activity
in the system.
.PP
The routine is implemented by setting an alarm clock signal
and pausing until it occurs.
The previous state of this signal is saved and restored.
If the sleep time exceeds the time to the alarm signal,
the process sleeps only until the signal would have occurred, and the
signal is sent 1 second later.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
alarm(2), pause(2)
