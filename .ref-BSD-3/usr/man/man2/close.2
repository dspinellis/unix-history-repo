.SH DESCRIPTION
Given
a file descriptor such as returned from an
.I open,
.I creat,
.I dup
or
.IR pipe (2)
call,
.I close
closes the associated file.
A close of all files is automatic on
.I exit,
but since
there is a limit on the number of open files per process,
.I close
is necessary for programs which deal with many files.
.PP
Files are closed upon termination of a process, and
certain high-numbered file descriptors are closed by
.IR exec (2).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
creat(2), open(2), pipe(2), exec(2)
