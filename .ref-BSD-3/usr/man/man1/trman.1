trman \- translate version 6 manual macros to version 7 macros
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B trman
[ file  ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Trman
reads the input file, which should be nroff/troff input and attempts
to translate the version 6 manual sections therein to version 7 format.
It is largely successful, but seems to have trouble
with indented paragraphs and complicated font control.
You should expect to have to fix up long sections by hand somewhat.
