.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Lpr
uses a spooling daemon to print the named files when facilities
become available.  If no names appear, the standard input is assumed.
.Pp
The following single letter options are used to notify the line printer
spooler that the files are not standard text files. The spooling daemon will
use the appropriate filters to print the data accordingly.
.Tw Fl
.Tp Fl c
The files are assumed to contain data produced by
.Xr cifplot 1
.Tp Fl d
The files are assumed to contain data from
.Em tex
(DVI format from Stanford).
.Tp Fl f
Use a filter which interprets the first character of each line as a
standard FORTRAN carriage control character.
.Tp Fl g
The files are assumed to contain standard plot data as produced by the
.Xr plot
routines (see also
.Xr plot
for the filters used by the printer spooler).
.Tp Fl l
Use a filter which allows control characters to be printed and suppresses
page breaks.
.Tp Fl n
The files are assumed to contain data from
.Em ditroff
(device independent troff).
.Tp Fl p
Use
.Xr pr  1
to format the files (equivalent to
.Em print  ) .
.Tp Fl t
The files are assumed to contain data from
.Xr troff  1
(cat phototypesetter commands).
.Tp Fl v
The files are assumed to contain a raster image for devices like the
Benson Varian.
.Tp
.Pp
These options apply to the handling of
the print job:
.Tw Fl
.Tp Fl P
Force output to a specific printer.  Normally,
the default printer is used (site dependent), or the value of the
environment variable
.Ev PRINTER
is used.
.Tp Fl h
Suppress the printing of the burst page.
.Tp Fl m
Send mail upon completion.
.Tp Fl r
Remove the file upon completion of spooling or upon completion of
printing (with the
.Fl s
option).
.Tp Fl s
Use symbolic links.  Usually files are copied to the spool directory.
The
.Fl s
option will use
.Xr symlink  2
to link data files rather than trying to copy them so large files can be
printed.  This means the files should
not be modified or removed until they have been printed.
.Tp
.Pp
The remaining options apply to copies, the page display, and headers:
.Tw Fl
.Tc Fl \&#
.Ar num
.Cx
The quantity
.Ar num
is the number of copies desired of each file named.  For example,
.Pp
.Dl lpr \-#3 foo.c bar.c more.c
.Pp
would result in 3 copies of the file foo.c, followed by 3 copies
of the file bar.c, etc.  On the other hand,
.Pp
.Dl cat foo.c bar.c more.c \&| lpr \-#3
.Pp
will give three copies of the concatenation of the files. Often
a site will disable this feature to encourage use of a photocopier
instead.
.Tc Fl
.Op Cm 1234
.Ws
.Ar font
.Cx
Specifies a
.Ar font
to be mounted on font position
.Ar i  .
The daemon
will construct a
.Li .railmag
file referencing
the font pathname.
.Tc Fl C
.Ws
.Ar class
.Cx
Job classification
to use on the burst page.  For example,
.Pp
.Dl lpr \-C EECS foo.c
.Pp
causes the system name (the name returned by
.Xr hostname  1  )
to be replaced on the burst page by EECS,
and the file foo.c to be printed.
.Tc Fl J
.Ws
.Ar job
.Cx
Job name to print on the burst page.
Normally, the first file's name is used.
.Tc Fl T
.Ws
.Ar title
.Cx
Title name for
.Xr pr  1 ,
instead of the file name.
.Tc Fl U
.Ws
.Ar user
.Cx
User name to print on the burst page,
also for accounting purposes.
This option is only honored if the real user-id is daemon
(or that specified in the printcap file instead of daemon),
and is intended for those instances where print filters wish to requeue jobs.
.Tc Fl i
.Ws
.Op numcols
.Cx
The output is indented. If the next argument
is numeric
.Pf \&( Ar numcols ) ,
it is used as the number of blanks to be printed before each
line; otherwise, 8 characters are printed.
.Tc Fl w
.Ar num
.Cx
Uses
.Ar num
as the page width for
.Xr pr 1 .
.Tp
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
If the following environment variable exists, it is used by
.Nm lpr :
.Tw Fl
.Tp Ev PRINTER
Specifies an alternate default printer.

.Sh HISTORY
.Nm Lpr
appeared in 3 BSD.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
If you try to spool too large a file, it will be truncated.
.Nm Lpr
will object to printing binary files.
If a user other than root prints a file and spooling is disabled,
.Nm lpr
will print a message saying so and will not put jobs in the queue.
If a connection to
.Xr lpd 1
on the local machine cannot be made,
.Nm lpr
will say that the daemon cannot be started.
Diagnostics may be printed in the daemon's log file
regarding missing spool files by
.Xr lpd 1 .
.Sh BUGS
Fonts for
.Xr troff 1
and
.Xr tex
reside on the host with the printer. It is currently not possible to
use local font libraries.
