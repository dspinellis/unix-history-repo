.SH NAME
sliplogin \- attach a serial line network interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sliplogin
[
.I loginname
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sliplogin
is used to turn the terminal line on standard input into
a Serial Line IP (SLIP) link to a remote host.  To do this, the program
searches the file
.B /etc/slip.hosts
for an entry matching
.I loginname
(which defaults to the current login name if omitted).
If a matching entry is found, the line is configured appropriately
for slip (8-bit transparent i/o) and converted to SLIP line
discipline.  Then a shell script is invoked to initialize the slip
interface with the appropriate local and remote IP address,
netmask, etc.
.PP
The usual initialization script is
.B /etc/slip.login
but, if particular hosts need special initialization, the file
.BI /etc/slip.login. loginname
will be executed instead if it exists.
The script is invoked with the parameters
.TP
.I slipunit
The unit number of the slip interface assigned to this line.  E.g.,
.B 0
for
.BR sl0 .
.TP
.I speed
The speed of the line.
.TP
.I args
The arguments from the
.B /etc/slip.hosts
entry, in order starting with
.IR loginname .
.PP
Only the super-user may attach a network interface.  The interface is
automatically detached when the other end hangs up or the
.B sliplogin
process dies.  If the kernel slip
module has been configured for it, all routes through that interface will
also disappear at the same time.  If there is other processing a site
would like done on hangup, the file
.B /etc/slip.logout
or
.BI /etc/slip.logout. loginname
is executed if it exists.  It is given the same arguments as the login script.
.SS Format of /etc/slip.hosts
Comments (lines starting with a `#') and blank lines are ignored.
Other lines must start with a
.I loginname
but the remaining arguments can be whatever is appropriate for the
.B slip.login
file that will be executed for that name.
Arguments are separated by white space and follow normal
.BR sh (1)
quoting conventions (however,
.I loginname
cannot be quoted).
Usually, lines have the form
.RS
.I
loginname local-address remote-address netmask opt-args
.RE
where
.I local-address
and
.I remote-address
are the IP host names or addresses of the local and remote ends of the
slip line and
.I netmask
is the appropriate IP netmask.  These arguments are passed
directly to
.BR ifconfig (8).
.I Opt-args
are optional arguments used to configure the line.
.SH EXAMPLE
The normal use of
.B sliplogin
is to create a
.B /etc/passwd
entry for each legal, remote slip site with
.B sliplogin
as the shell for that entry.  E.g.,
.RS
Sfoo:ikhuy6:2010:1:slip line to foo:/tmp:/etc/sliplogin
.RE
(Our convention is to name the account used by remote host
.I hostname
as
.IR Shostname .)
Then an entry is added to
.B slip.hosts
that looks like:
.RS
Sfoo	`hostname`	foo	netmask
.RE
where
.I `hostname`
will be evaluated by
.B sh
to the local host name and
.I netmask
is the local host IP netmask.
.PP
Note that
.B sliplogin
must be setuid to root and, while not a security hole, moral defectives
can use it to place terminal lines in an unusable state and/or deny
access to legitimate users of a remote slip line.  To prevent this,
a site can create a group, say
.IR slip ,
that only the slip login accounts are put in then make sure that
.B /etc/sliplogin
is in group
.I slip
and mode 4550 (setuid root, only group
.I slip
can execute binary).
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.B sliplogin
logs various information to the system log daemon,
.BR syslogd (8),
with a facility code of
.BR daemon .
The messages are listed here, grouped by severity level.
.SS Err Severity

.B /etc/slip.hosts
file could not be opened.
.TP
