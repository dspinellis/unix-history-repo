.SH NAME
implogd \- IMP logger process
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B implogd
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Implogd
is program which logs error messages from the IMP,
placing them in the file
.IR /var/log/implog .
.PP
Entries in the file are variable length.  Each log
entry has a fixed length header of the form:
.PP
.ta 0.5i 1.0i 1.5i
.nf
struct sockstamp {
	short	sin_family;
	u_short	sin_port;
	struct	in_addr sin_addr;
	time_t	sin_time;
	int	sin_len;
};
.fi
.PP
followed, possibly, by the message received from the IMP.
Each time the logging process is started up it places a
time stamp entry in the file (a header with
.I sin_len
field set to 0).
.PP
The logging process will catch only those message from the IMP
which are not processed by a protocol module, e.g. IP.
This implies the log should contain only status information such
as ``IMP going down'' messages, ``host down'' and other error messages,
and, perhaps, stray NCP messages.
