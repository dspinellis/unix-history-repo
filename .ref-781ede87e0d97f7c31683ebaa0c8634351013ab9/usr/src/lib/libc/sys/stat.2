.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Stat
obtains information about the file
.IR path .
Read, write or execute
permission of the named file is not required, but all directories
listed in the path name leading to the file must be reachable.
.PP
.I Lstat
is like \fIstat\fP except in the case where the named file is a symbolic link,
in which case
.I lstat
returns information about the link,
while
.I stat
returns information about the file the link references.
.PP
.I Fstat
obtains the same information about an open file
referenced by the argument descriptor, such as would
be obtained by an
.I open
call.
.PP
.I Buf
is a pointer to a
.I stat
structure into which information is placed concerning the file.
The contents of the structure pointed to by
.IR buf :
.PP
.nf
    struct stat {
        dev_t    st_dev;      /* device inode resides on */
        ino_t    st_ino;      /* inode's number */
        u_short  st_mode;     /* inode protection mode */
        short    st_nlink;    /* number or hard links to the file */
        uid_t    st_uid;      /* user-id of owner */
        gid_t    st_gid;      /* group-id of owner */
        dev_t    st_rdev;     /* device type, for special file inode */
        off_t    st_size;     /* file size, in bytes */
        time_t   st_atime;    /* time of last access */
        int      st_spare1;
        time_t   st_mtime;    /* time of last data modification */
        int      st_spare2;
        time_t   st_ctime;    /* time of last file status change */
        int      st_spare3;
        long     st_blksize;  /* optimal file system I/O ops blocksize */
        long     st_blocks;   /* blocks allocated for file */
        u_long   st_flags;    /* user defined flags for file */
        u_long   st_gen;      /* file generation number */
    };

st_atime
Time when file data was last accessed.  Changed by the following system
calls:
.IR mknod (2),
.IR utimes (2),
and
.IR read (2).
For reasons of efficiency, 
st_atime is not set when a directory
is searched, although this would be more logical.
.TP
st_mtime
Time when data was last modified.
It is not set by changes of owner, group, link count, or mode.
Changed by the following system calls:
.IR mknod (2),
.IR utimes (2),
.IR write (2).
.TP
st_ctime
Time when file status was last changed.
It is set both both by writing and changing the i-node.
Changed by the following system calls:
.IR chmod (2)
.IR chown (2),
.IR link (2),
.IR mknod (2),
.IR rename (2),
.IR unlink (2),
.IR utimes (2),
.IR write (2).
.TP
st_blocks
The actual number of blocks allocated for the file in 512-byte units.
.PP
The status information word \fIst_mode\fP has bits:

The mode bits 0000070 and 0000007 encode group and
others permissions (see
.IR chmod (2)).
.SH "RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH "ERRORS
.I Stat
and
.I lstat
will fail if one or more of the following are true:
.TP 15
[ENOTDIR]
A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
.TP 15
[EINVAL]
The pathname contains a character with the high-order bit set.
.TP 15
[ENAMETOOLONG]
A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters,
or an entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.
.TP 15
[ENOENT]
The named file does not exist.
.TP 15
[EACCES]
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix.
.TP 15
[ELOOP]
Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.
.TP 15
[EFAULT]
.I Buf
or
.I name
points to an invalid address.
.TP 15
[EIO]
An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.
.PP
.I Fstat
will fail if one or both of the following are true:
.TP 15
[EBADF]
.I Fildes
is not a valid open file descriptor.
.TP 15
[EFAULT]
.I Buf
points to an invalid address.
.TP 15
[EIO]
An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.
.SH CAVEAT
The fields in the stat structure currently marked 
.IR st_spare1 ,
.IR st_spare2 ,
and
.I st_spare3
are present in preparation for inode time stamps expanding
to 64 bits.  This, however, can break certain programs that
depend on the time stamps being contiguous (in calls to
.IR utimes (2)).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
chmod(2), chown(2), utimes(2)
.SH BUGS
Applying
.I fstat
to a socket (and thus to a pipe)
returns a zero'd buffer,
except for the blocksize field,
and a unique device and inode number.
