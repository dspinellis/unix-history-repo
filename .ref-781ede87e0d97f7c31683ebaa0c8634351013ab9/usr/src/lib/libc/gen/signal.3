.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Signal
is a simplified interface to the more general
.IR sigaction (2)
facility.
.PP
A signal
is generated by some abnormal event,
initiated by a user at a terminal (quit, interrupt, stop),
by a program error (bus error, etc.),
by request of another program (kill),
or when a process is stopped because it wishes to access
its control terminal while in the background (see
.IR tty (4)).
Signals are optionally generated
when a process resumes after being stopped,
when the status of child processes changes,
or when input is ready at the control terminal.
Most signals cause termination of the receiving process if no action
is taken; some signals instead cause the process receiving them
to be stopped, or are simply discarded if the process has not
requested otherwise.
Except for the SIGKILL and SIGSTOP
signals, the
.I signal
call allows signals either to be ignored
or to cause an interrupt to a specified location.
The following is a list of all signals with
names as in the include file
.RI < signal.h >:

.PP
The starred signals in the list above cause a core image
if not caught or ignored.
.PP
If
.I func
is SIG_DFL, the default action
for signal
.I sig
is reinstated; this default is termination
(with a core image for starred signals)
except for signals marked with \*b or \*d.
Signals marked with \*b are discarded if the action
is SIG_DFL; signals marked
with \*d cause the process to stop.
If
.I func
is SIG_IGN the signal is subsequently ignored
and pending instances of the signal are discarded.
Otherwise, when the signal occurs
further occurrences of the signal are
automatically blocked and
.I func
is called.
.PP
A return from the function unblocks
the handled signal and
continues the process at the point it was interrupted.
\fBUnlike previous signal facilities, the handler \fIfunc\fP
remains installed after a signal has been delivered.\fP
.PP
If a caught signal occurs
during certain system calls, causing
the call to terminate prematurely, the call
is automatically restarted
(the handler is installed using the SA_RESTART flag with
.IR sigaction (2)).
The affected system calls include
.IR read (2),
.IR write (2),
.IR sendto (2),
.IR recvfrom (2),
.IR sendmsg (2)
and
.IR recvmsg (2)
on a communications channel or a slow device (such as a terminal,
but not a regular file)
and during a
.IR wait (2)
or
.IR ioctl (2).
However, calls that have already committed are not restarted,
but instead return a partial success (for example, a short read count).
.PP
The value of
.I signal
is the previous (or initial)
value of
.I func
for the particular signal.
.PP
After a
.IR fork (2)
or
.IR vfork (2)
the child inherits
all signals.
.IR  Execve (2)
resets all caught signals to the default action;
ignored signals remain ignored.
.SH "RETURN VALUE
The previous action is returned on a successful call.
Otherwise, \-1 is returned and 
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.I Signal
will fail and no action will take place if one of the
following occur:
.TP 15
[EINVAL]
.I Sig
is not a valid signal number.
.TP 15
[EINVAL]
An attempt is made to ignore or supply a handler for SIGKILL
or SIGSTOP.

.SH "NOTES  (VAX-11)"
The handler routine can be declared:
.PP
    void handler(sig, code, scp)
.PP
Here
.I sig
is the signal number, into which the hardware faults and traps are
mapped as defined below.  Code is a parameter which is either a constant
as given below or, for compatibility mode faults, the code provided by
the hardware. 
.I Scp
is a pointer to the
.I "struct sigcontext"
used by the system to restore the process context from before
the signal.
Compatibility mode faults are distinguished from the
other SIGILL traps by having PSL_CM set in the psl.
.PP
The following defines the mapping of hardware traps to signals
and codes.  All of these symbols are defined in
.RI < signal.h >:
