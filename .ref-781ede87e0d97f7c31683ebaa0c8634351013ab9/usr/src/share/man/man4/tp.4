TP \- ISO Transport Protocol
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBs = socket( [ AF_INET, AF_ISO ] , SOCK_SEQPACKET, 0);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The TP protocol provides reliable, flow-controlled, two-way
transmission of data and record boundaries. 
It is a byte-stream protocol and is accessed according to
the SOCK_SEQPACKET abstraction.
The TP protocol makes use of a standard ISO address format,
including a Network Service Access Point, and a Transport Service Entity
Selector.
Subclass 4 may make use of the internet
Internet address format.
.PP
Sockets utilizing the tp protocol are either \*(lqactive\*(rq or
\*(lqpassive\*(rq.  Active sockets initiate connections to passive
sockets.  By default TCP sockets are created active; to create a
passive socket the
.IR listen (2)
system call must be used
after binding the socket with the
.IR bind (2)
system call.  Only
passive sockets may use the 
.IR accept (2)
call to accept incoming connections.  Only active sockets may
use the
.IR connect (2)
call to initiate connections.
.PP
Passive sockets may \*(lqunderspecify\*(rq their location to match
incoming connection requests from multiple networks.  This
technique, termed \*(lqwildcard addressing\*(rq, allows a single
server to provide service to clients on multiple networks.
To create a socket which listens on all networks, the NSAP portion
of the bound address must be void (of length zero).
The Transport Selector may still be specified
at this time; if the port is not specified the system will assign one.
Once a connection has been established the socket's address is
fixed by the peer entity's location.   The address assigned the
socket is the address associated with the network interface
through which packets are being transmitted and received.
.PP
The ISO Transport Protocol implemented for AOS R2
at the University of Wisconsin - Madison,
and modified for inclusion in the Berkeley Software Distribution,
includes classes 0 and 4 
of the ISO transport protocols
as specified in
the June 1986 version of IS 8073.
Class 4 of the protocol provides reliable, sequenced,
flow-controlled, two-way
transmission of data packets with an alternate stop-and-wait data path called
the "expedited data" service.
Class 0 is essentially a null transport protocol, which is used
when the underlying network service provides reliable, sequenced,
flow-controlled, two-way data transmission.
Class 0 does not provide the expedited data service.
The protocols are implemented as a single transport layer entity 
that coexists with the Internet protocol suite.
Class 0 may be used only in the ISO domain.
Class 4 may be used in the Internet domain as well as in the ISO domain.
.PP
Two system calls were modified from the previous
release of the Berkeley Software Distribution
to permit the support the end-of-transport-service-data-unit (EOTSDU)
indication, and for the receipt and transmission of user
connect, confirm, and disconnect data.
See \fIsendmsg(2)\fR and \fIrecmsgv(2)\fR, and further discussion
below for the formats of the data in the ancillary data buffer.
If the EOTSDU is not needed, the normal
.IR read (2),
and
.IR write (2)
system calls may be used.
.PP
Through the 
\fIgetsockopt\fR and \fIsetsockopt\fR
system calls,
TP supports several options 
to control such things as negotiable options
in the protocol and protocol strategies.
The options are defined in \fB<netiso/tp_user.h>\fR,
and are described below.
.\".PP
.\"The options marked with a percent sign ( \fB%\fR )
.\"are limited to use by the super-user.
.PP
In the tables below,
the options marked with a pound sign ( \fB#\fR )
may be used 
with \fIsetsockopt()\fR
after a connection is established.
Others must be used before the connection
is established, in other words,
before calling
\fIconnect()\fR or 
\fIaccept()\fR.
All options may be used 
with \fIgetsockopt()\fR
before or
after a connection is established.
.\"
.\" .PP
.\" The options marked with an exclamation point ( \fB!\fR )
.\" may be used after a connection is released,
.\" but before 
.\" the TP reference timer (which generally
.\" has a value in minutes) expires, and before
.\" a \fIclose()\fR system call.
.\" In other words, these commands may be used when the peer closes
.\" a connection (possibly causing a disconnect indication), as long as the command
.\" is issued "soon" after the disconnection occurred.

.IP
\fBDescription\fR
.TP 25
TPOPT_CONN_DATA
(char *) [none]
.IP
Data to send on \fIconnect()\fR.
The passive user may issue a
.IR getsockopt ()
call to retrieve a connection request's user data,
after having done the
.IR accept ()
system call without implying confirmation of the connection.
.IP
The data may also be retrieved by issuing a
.IR recvmsg ()
request for ancillary data only,
without implying confirmation of the connection.
The returned cmsghdr will contain SOL_TRANSPORT for the csmg_level
and TPOPT_CONN_DATA for cmsg_type.
.TP 25
TPOPT_DISC_DATA\fB #\fR
(char *) [none]
.IP
Data to send on \fIclose()\fR.
Disconnect data may be sent by the side initiating the close
but not by the passive side ("passive" with respect to the closing
of the connection), so there is no need to read disconnect data
after calling \fIclose()\fR.
This may be sent by a
.IR setsockopt ()
system call, or by issuing a
.IR sendmsg ()
request specifying ancillary data only.
The user-provided cmsghdr must contain SOL_TRANSPORT for csmg_level
and TPOPT_DISC_DATA for cmsg_type.
Sending of disconnect data will in of itself tear down (or reject)
the connection.
.TP 25
TPOPT_CFRM_DATA\fB #\fR
(char *) [none]
.IP
Data to send when confirming a connection.
This may aslo be sent by a 
.IR setsockopt ()
system call, or by issuing a
.IR sendmsg ()
request, as above.
Sending of connect confirm data will cause the connection
to be confirmed rather than rejected.
.\".TP 25
.\"TPOPT_CDDATA_CLEAR\fB #\fR
.\"No associated value.
.\".IP
.\"Erase outgoing connect or disconnect data.
.TP 25
TPOPT_PERF_MEAS\fB #\fR
Boolean.
.IP
When \fBtrue\fR, performance measurements will be kept
for this connection.  
When set before a connection is established, the
active side will use a locally defined parameter on the
connect request packet; if the peer is another ARGO
implementation, this will cause performance measurement to be
turned on 
on the passive side as well.
See \fItpperf(8)\fR.
.TP 25
TPOPT_PSTATISTICS\fB\fR
No associated value on input.
On output, struct tp_pmeas.
.IP
This command is used to read the performance statistics accumulated
during a connection's lifetime.
It can only be used with \fIgetsockopt()\fR.
The structure it returns is described in \fB<netiso/tp_stat.h>\fR.
See \fItpperf(8)\fR.
.TP 25
TPOPT_FLAGS
unsigned integer. [ 0x0 ]
.IP
This command can only be used with \fIgetsockopt()\fR.
See the description of the flags below.
.TP 25
TPOPT_PARAMS\fB\fR
struct tp_conn_param.
.IP
Used to get or set a group parameters for a connection.
The struct tp_conn_param is the argument used with the
\fIgetsockopt()\fR or \fIsetsockopt()\fR system call. 
It is described in 
\fB<netiso/tp_user.h>\fR.

p_winsize
short integer between 128 and 16384. [4096 bytes]
.IP
The buffer space limits in bytes for incoming and outgoing data.
There is no way to specify different limits for incoming and outgoing
paths.
The actual window size at any time
during the lifetime of a connection
is a function of the buffer size limit, the negotiated
maximum TPDU size, and the 
rate at which the user program receives data.
This parameter applies only to class 4.
.\" ******************8
.TP 25
p_tpdusize
unsigned char between 0x7 and 0xd. 
[ 0xc for class 4 ] [ 0xb for class 0 ]
.IP
Log 2 of the maximum TPDU size to be negotiated.
The TP standard (ISO 8473) gives an upper bound of 
0xd for class 4 and 0xb for class 0.
The ARGO implementation places upper bounds of
0xc on class 4 and 0xb on class 0.

p_ack_strat
TPACK_EACH or TPACK_WINDOW.  [ TPACK_WINDOW ]
.IP
This parameter applies only to class 4.
Two acknowledgment strategies are supported:
.IP
TPACK_EACH means that each data TPDU is acknowledged
with an AK TPDU.
.IP
TPACK_WINDOW
means that upon receipt of the packet that represents
the high edge of the last window advertised, and AK TPDU is generated.
.\" ******************8
.TP 25
p_rx_strat
4 bit mask
[ TPRX_USE_CW | TPRX_FASTSTART over
connectionless network protocols ]
[ TPRX_USE_CW over
connection-oriented network protocols ]
.IP
This parameter applies only to class 4.
The bit mask may include the following values:
.IP
TPRX_EACH: When a retransmission timer expires, retransmit
each packet in the send window rather than
just the first unacknowledged packet.
.IP
TPRX_USE_CW: Use a "congestion window" strategy borrowed
from Van Jacobson's congestion window strategy for TCP.
The congestion window size is set to one whenever
a retransmission occurs.
.IP
TPRX_FASTSTART: Begin sending the maximum amount of data permitted
by the peer (subject to availability).
The alternative is to start sending slowly by 
pretending the peer's window is smaller than it is, and letting
it slowly grow up to the real peer's window size.
This is to smooth the effect of new connections on a congested network
by preventing a transport connection from suddenly 
overloading the network with a burst of packets.
This strategy is also due to Van Jacobson.

.SH "ERROR VALUES
.PP
The TP entity returns \fIerrno\fR error values as defined in
\fB<sys/errno.h>\fR
and
\fB<netiso/iso_errno.h>\fR.
User programs may print messages associated with these value by
using an expanded version of \fIperror()\fR
found in the ISO library, \fIlibisodir.a\fR.
.PP
If the TP entity encounters asynchronous events
that will cause a transport connection to be closed,
such as
timing out while retransmitting a connect request TPDU,
or receiving a DR TPDU,
the TP entity issues a SIGURG signal, indicating that
disconnection has occurred.
If the signal is issued during a 
a system call, the system call may be interrupted,
in which case the
\fIerrno\fR value upon return from the system call is EINTR.
If the signal SIGURG
is being handled by reading
from the socket, and it was a \fIaccept()\fR that
timed out, the read may result in ENOTSOCK,
because the \fIaccept()\fR call had not yet returned a
legitimate socket descriptor when the signal was handled.
ETIMEDOUT (or a some other errno value appropriate to the
type of error) is returned if SIGURG is blocked
for the duration of the system call.
A user program should take one of the following approaches:
.IP "Block SIGURG." 5
If the program is servicing
only one connection, it can block or ignore SIGURG during connection 
establishment.
The advantage of this is that the \fIerrno\fR value
returned is somewhat meaningful.
The disadvantage of this is that
if ignored, disconnection and expedited data indications could be
missed.
For some programs this is not a problem.
.IP "Handle SIGURG." 5
If the program is servicing more than one connection at a time
or expedited data may arrive or both, the program may elect to
service SIGURG.
It can use the \fIgetsockopt(...TPOPT_FLAGS...)\fR system 
call to see if the signal
was due to the arrival of expedited data or due to a disconnection.
In the latter case, 
\fIgetsockopt()\fR
will return ENOTCONN.
.SH BUGS
.PP
The protocol definition of expedited data is slightly problematic,
in a way that renders expedited data almost useless,
if two or more packets of expedited data are send within
time 
\(*e,
where \(*e
depends on the application.
The problem is not of major significance since most applications
do not use transport expedited data.
The problem is this:
the expedited data acknowledgment TPDU has no field for conveying
credit, thus it is not possible for a TP entity to inform its peer
that "I received your expedited data but have no room to receive more."
The TP entity has the choice of acknowledging receipt of the
XPD TPDU 
.TP 10
when the user receives the XPD TSDU
which may be a fairly long time,
which may cause the sending TP entity to retransmit the packet,
and possibly to close the connection after retransmission, or
.TP 10
when the TP entity receives it
so the sending entity does not retransmit or close the connection.
If the sending user then tries to send more expedited data
"soon", the expedited data will not be acknowledged (until the
receiving user receives the first XPD TSDU).
.PP
The ARGO implementation acknowledges XPD TPDUs immediately,
in the hope that most users will not use expedited data requently
enough for this to be a problem.
