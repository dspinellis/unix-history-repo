.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Tc
interprets its
input (standard input default)
as device codes for a Graphic Systems phototypesetter (cat).
The standard output of
.I tc
is intended for a Tektronix 4015 (a 4014 teminal
with ASCII and APL character sets).
The sixteen typesetter sizes are mapped into the 4014's
four sizes;
the entire TROFF character set is drawn using the 4014's
character generator,
using overstruck combinations where necessary.
Typical usage:
.IP "" 15

At the end of each page
.I tc
waits for a newline (empty line) from the keyboard before
continuing on to the next page.
In this wait state, the command
.B e
will suppress the screen erase before the next page;
.B s\c
N will cause the next N pages to be skipped;
and
.B !\c
line will send line to the shell.
