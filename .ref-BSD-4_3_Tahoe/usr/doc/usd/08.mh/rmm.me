\fIRmm\fR removes the specified messages by renaming the message
files with preceding commas.  Many sites consider files that start with a 
comma to be a temporary backup, and arrange for \fIcron\fR\0(8)
to remove such files once a day.

If the user has a profile component such as

	rmmproc:	/bin/rm

then instead of simply renaming the message file,
\fIrmm\fR
will call the named program to delete the file.
Note that at most installations, 
\fIcron\fR\0(8) is told to remove files that begin with a comma once a night.

Some users of csh prefer the following:

	alias rmm 'refile +d'

where folder +d is a folder for deleted messages, and

	alias mexp 'rm `mhpath +d all`'

is used to \*(lqexpunge\*(rq deleted messages.

The current message is not changed by \fIrmm\fR, so a \fInext\fR  will
advance to the next message in the folder as expected.
