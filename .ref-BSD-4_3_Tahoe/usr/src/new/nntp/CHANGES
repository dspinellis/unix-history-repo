    This file describes the changes which have been made in NNTP
since the initial release.  Individuals who either reported or
inspired the bug/bug fix are in square brackets.

1.4	October 15, 1987

	Reorganized documentation directory.  Thanks for the
	extraction stuff, Stan.  [Stan Barber, sob%%soma.uucp@rice.edu]

	Added transfer timeouts.  [Steve Schoch, schoch@ames.arpa]

	Fixed a problem with IHAVE which allowed a remote machine to
	repeatedly feed you articles that you expired (although all
	you'd do with them is throw them away).
	[Fred Avolio, avolio@decuac.dec.com]

	DECNet support (see server/dnet_access.c and common/clientlib.c).
        [Matt Thomas, thomas%syrah.dec@decwrl.dec.com]

	Fixed serious joe code in distribution checks in NEWNEWS.

	NEWNEWS statistics.

	Newsgroup security.

	Performance enhancements (about 2x better for article xfers).

	xhdr command added to improve performance on subject searches.

	Compiled-in server name no longer supported.

	common/clientlib.c/getserverbyfile() now looks at the
	environment variable NNTPSERVER before checking the file.

	inews/inews.c now limits .signature files to MAX_SIGNATURE lines.

	server/misc.c/spawn() now returns the error output of rnews/inews
	alone with the posting failed code.  This is in turn printed by
	inews/inews.c so the user has some idea of why his article wasn't
	accepted.

	rn patches now for patchlevel #40
		Bug fix: rrn no longer leaves droppings in /tmp
		"Skipping unavailable article" problems fixed
		Support for 4.3 TIOCGWINSZ ioctl [sam@okeeffe.berkeley.edu]
		Configure asks for domains
		Pnews/Rnmail understand hostnames with .'s in them.
		Makefile fixes [harvard!lownlab!kiely]

	PYRAMID #defines removed, as it is all being done by default now.

	inews/inews.c now exits 0, since before it had a random exit
	status, causing pyramids to choke.  [forys@boulder.colorado.edu]

	server/server.c now logs user/system/elapsed time as floats
	instead of ints.  [rick@seismo.css.gov]

	server/ihave.c no longer logs every message id transfered but
	instead keeps statistics which are logged at the end.
	[rick@seismo.css.gov]

	server/serve.c now times out after TIMEOUT seconds of idleness.

	server/access.c converts remote hostname to lower case
	when logging, in case you have a nameserver which is helping you.

	server/misc.c/getartbyid now reports message-id's when
	it encounters a malformed line in the history file.
	[gds@spam.istc.sri.com]

	inews/inews.c had an uninitialized variable, which
	could cause trouble.  [jwp%chem@sdcsvax.ucsd.edu]

	common/clientlib.c now understands 4.3 nameserver
	multiple addresses, and tries them all before
	giving up.

	common/clientlib.c has has 2 new functions:
	"getserverbyfile" opens a given file and returns
	the name of the server given in the file to use
	for news.  "handle_server_response" prints informative
	messages based on the initial connection response code.

	server/access.c now is case insensitive when checking
	for host read/xfer permissions.

	server/misc.c/spawn didn't check for a closed connection
	while receiving input from client.  As a result, truncated
	news articles could be received.

	server/newnews.c had a printf which was missing an
	argument.  [louie@trantor.umd.edu]

	Added fake syslog facility to server.  Code is in
	server/fakesyslog.c.  [mckenny@sri-unix.arpa]

	Fixed length argument to accept() in server/main.c
	[mckenny@sri-unix.arpa]

	Now uses pipe to rnews so as to get rnews output for debugging.
	Also chowns temporary file to POSTER's uid and gid.
	[mckenny@sri-unix.arpa]

	Fixed bugs in server/netaux.c to close syslog fd.
	[mckenny@sri-unix.arpa]

	Made bcopy() standard in server/misc.c  [kre@munnari.OZ]

	Documentation changes to make certain things about client
	installation clearer.  [munnari!charlie.oz!craig]

1.3	30 June 1986

	rrn is no longer included as complete source, but
	rather as a set of context diffs and a program to
	apply them to your rn source.  Many thanks go to
	Gene Spafford for an outstanding job doing this.
	[spaf@gatech.csnet]

	The dreaded kill/save bug is fixed; rn was passing
	/bin/sh too many open file descriptors.  Thanks and a tip of the
	proverbial hat to Chris Maio!  Change to rrn/util.c.
	[chris@columbia.edu]	

	Fixed a bug in rrn/artio.c which caused an assertion
	failure on line 114 of artio.c; artopen was returning
	Nullfp without closing the fp associated with the
	bogus article.  [genrad!ens@eddie.mit.edu, beorn@ic.berkeley.edu]

	Added #define PYRAMID in common/conf.h, added some
	#ifdef PYRAMID code in server/misc.c to deal with
	Pyramids not initializing static data to 0, as well
	as an fseek problem.  [spaf@gatech.CSNET]

	Another wait bug fixed in spawn() in server/misc.c.

	Added a required \r in post.c.

	Added signal(SIGCHLD, SIG_IGN) to server/serve.c,
	to fix exit status problem with ALONE defined.

	Statistics logging now returns sum of the nntpd and
	its children for process time.  server/main.c
	[fair@ucbarpa.berkeley.edu]

	Subnet support for access file finally added.
	server/subnet.c added, common/conf.h now has
	#defines for SUBNET, DAMAGED_NETMASK.

	inews/inews.c now generates a from line with the UUCP
	name instead of always using gethostname().  common/conf.h
	changed to add #defines for UUNAME, GHNAME.
	[jwang@atrp.mit.edu]

	Added LIBS to Makefile. [soma!sob@rice.edu]

1.2c	17 May 1986

	Support for Masscomp added (#define MASSCOMP in ../common/conf.h).
	[soma!sob@rice.edu]

	Syslog output now requires SYSLOG to be defined in ../common/conf.h.
	This is handy on systems which, for some reason or another,
	don't have syslog.  [soma!sob@rice.edu]

	server/post.c had arguments reversed in a printf.  [salex@rice.edu]

	rrn/common.h had PIPESAVER misdefined. [cspencer@bbncc5.arpa]

	server/group.c was missing a \r in a printf.  [lear@rutgers.edu]

	xmit/nntpxmit.c is a new version.  Highlights include
	improved error reactions and logging info.  [fair@ucbarpa.berkeley.edu]

	xmit/nntpsend is a shell script for sending news via nntp
	in a sane manner, with locking.  [pleasant@topaz.rutgers.edu,
	fair@ucbarpa.berkeley.edu]  The locking mechanism is provided
	courtesy of Mr. Fair's "shlock.c", in xmit/shlock.c.

	support/nntp_awk produces weekly reports from the nntp server
	logging output.  [fair@ucbarpa.berkeley.edu]

	Makefile (in this directory) would do a "make install" as
	the default action; it now prints a helpful message.
	[arnold@cgl.ucsf.edu]

	server/Makefile and support/Makefile had needless dependencies
	in them; if you didn't do a make depend, you'd have problems
	on a 4.2 system.  The server and support stuff now depend only
	on their own .h files.  [arnold@cgl.ucsf.edu]

1.2b	13 April 1986

	common/clientlib.c stupidly had some debugging printfs
	enabled.

	rrn/{artio.c,head.c} had sprintf("... %d", foo) where "foo"
	was a long.  %d -> %ld.  [cspencer@bbncc5.arpa]

	server/time.c had an order of evaluation problem in the
	macro "twodigtoi".  [fletcher@tzec.cs.utexas.edu, among others.]

	server/common.h included <dbm.h> if DBM was defined,
	caused multiply-defined NULL's.  [cda@opal.berkeley.edu,
	pleasant@topaz.rutgers.edu, among others.]

	server/active.c would lose because variable "i" would be
	at the end of the group array if it was called on a timer
	interrupt.  "i" now set to zero properly.  This only occurs
	if FASTFORK is defined.  [cda@opal.berkeley.edu]

1.2a	20 March 1986

	common/conf.h defined MAX_GROUPS as 300; this was too low on
	some machines.  Upped to 450.  [solex@rice.edu, beorn@ic.berkeley.edu]

	rrn/Makefile.sh had .c instead of .o for OBJS and SRCS
	respectively.  Also had cc -o ../common/clientlib.o (see below).

	inews/inews.c had (char *) 0 for gets(), which made SUN's upset.
	Changed to simply NULL. [brian@sdcsvax.ucsd.edu]

	inews/Makefile had cc -o ../common/clientlib.o which some
	machines don't do.  [brian@sdcsvax.ucsd.edu]

	common/clientlib.c has "untp" instead of "nntp".

	server/active.c made more robust about reading active file
	if active file is longer than MAX_GROUPS.

	server/common.h included common/conf.h after checking for
	DBM, which caused some problems.  [soma!sob@rice.edu]

1.2	15 March 1986

	Released.
