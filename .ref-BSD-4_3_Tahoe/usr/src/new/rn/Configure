cat <<'EOH'
 
This installation shell script will examine your system and ask you questions
to determine how rn and its auxiliary files should be installed.  If you
get stuck on a question, you may use a ! shell escape to start a subshell or
execute a command.  Many of the questions will have default answers in
square brackets--typing carriage return will give you the default.

On some of the questions which ask for file or directory names you are
allowed to use the ~name construct to specify the login directory belonging
to "name", even if you don't have a shell which knows about that.  Questions
where this is allowed will be marked "(~name ok)".

Much effort has been expended to ensure that this shell script will run
on any Unix system.  If despite that it blows up on you, your best bet is
to edit Configure and run it again.  (Trying to install rn without having run
Configure is well nigh impossible.)  Also, let me (lwall@sdcrdcf.UUCP) know
how I blew it.

This installation script affects things in two ways: 1) it does direct
variable substitutions on some of the files included in this kit, and
2) it builds a config.h file for inclusion in C programs.  You may edit
any of these files as the need arises after running this script.

I can set things up so that your shell scripts and binaries are more portable,
at what may be a noticable cost in performance.  In particular, if you
ask to be portable, the following happens:

     1) shell scripts will rely on the PATH variable rather than using
	the paths derived above.
     2) ~username interpretations will be done at run time rather than
	by Configure.
     3) the system name will be determined at run time, if at all possible.

2)  you can have rn use a

Distribution groups are the things you use on the Distribution line to limit
where an article will go to.  You are likely to be a member of several
distribution groups, such as organization, city, state, province, country,
continent, etc.  For example, Los Angeles has the distribution prefix "la",
New Jersey has the prefix "nj", and Europe has the prefix "eunet".

The categories you will be asked are: 

local organization	(Could be just one machine or a cluster or an office)
organization		att, dec, kgb, ...
city			la, ny, mosc, ...
state/province		ca, nj, bc, ...
country			usa, can, rok, whatever
continent		na (North America, not "Not Applicable"), asia, etc.

(If you don't have a distribution prefix in any of these categories then
just hit return.)

NOTE: the V7 compiler may ignore some #undefs that rn uses.  If so, you will
get messages about redefining EXT.  Some V7 compilers also have difficulties
with #defines near buffer boundaries, so beware.  You may have to play with
the spacing in common.h.

NOTE: the PDP-11 does not have enough data space to do subject caching
reliably.  That feature will be disabled automatically.  Subject searching
will tend to be slow.
