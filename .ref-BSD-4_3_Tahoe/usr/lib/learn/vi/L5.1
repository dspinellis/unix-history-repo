		More Alteration - Targets

   When we first looked at the 'dd' and 'cc' commands, we said that they were
special cases of more general commands.  In fact, 'd' and 'c' are the basis
for some of the most powerful commands in vi.  We'll only talk about the 'd'
command here, but it's all applicable to 'c' as well.  

   The idea behind targets is to somehow combine the simple idea of deleting
things with the movement commands, yielding a whole set of new commands.
For example, the 'w' command will move the cursor ahead one word.  The
'dw' command will delete everything from where we are up to the beginning
of the next word.  ')' moves forward a sentence; 'd)' deletes a sentence.
You can use this for practically all movement commands, including all of 
the following:
			-  return  space
			^  $  0  H  L  M
			w  b  e  W  B  E  (  )
			f  F  t  T  ;  ,
			/  ?  n  N

   Type 'ready' and try out these commands.  Take your time and experiment!!

  Now you may be able to see the usefulness of the 't' and 'T' commands.
Recall that 'tx' moves the cursor to the character before the next 'x' on the
line.   Therefore, 'dtx' will delete everything up to, but not including,
the next 'x' on the line.  'dfx', on the other hand, will delete everything
up to and including the 'x'.  Both commands have their uses.

   Remember that all of these targets can also be used with the 'c' command.
That is, 'c3w' will allow you to change the next three words.  When you try 
this, note that vi doesn't actually erase the words and then put you into
insert mode (That's a lot of redrawing that may not be necessary).  It instead
places a dollar sign at the last character to be changed.  When you hit
Escape to get out of insert mode, the line will be fixed up.  Try it!

   In the next three lessons, we'll see other commands which, like 'c' and 'd',
can use targets.
