     _R_c_m_d is a routine used by the super-user to execute a com-
     mand on a remote machine using an authentication scheme
     based on reserved port numbers.  _R_r_e_s_v_p_o_r_t is a routine
     which returns a descriptor to a socket with an address in
     the privileged port space.  _R_u_s_e_r_o_k is a routine used by
     servers to authenticate clients requesting service with
     _r_c_m_d.  All three functions are present in the same file and
     are used by the _r_s_h_d(8C) server (among others).

     _R_c_m_d looks up the host *_a_h_o_s_t using _g_e_t_h_o_s_t_b_y_n_a_m_e(3N),
     returning -1 if the host does not exist.  Otherwise *_a_h_o_s_t
     is set to the standard name of the host and a connection is
     established to a server residing at the well-known Internet
     port _i_n_p_o_r_t.

     If the connection succeeds, a socket in the Internet domain
     of type SOCK_STREAM is returned to the caller, and given to
     the remote command as ssttddiinn and ssttddoouutt.  If _f_d_2_p is non-
     zero, then an auxiliary channel to a control process will be
     set up, and a descriptor for it will be placed in *_f_d_2_p.
     The control process will return diagnostic output from the
     command (unit 2) on this channel, and will also accept bytes
     on this channel as being UNIX signal numbers, to be for-
     warded to the process group of the command.  If _f_d_2_p is 0,
     then the ssttddeerrrr (unit 2 of the remote command) will be made
     the same as the ssttddoouutt and no provision is made for sending
     arbitrary signals to the remote process, although you may be
     able to get its attention by using out-of-band data.

     The protocol is described in detail in _r_s_h_d(8C).

     The _r_r_e_s_v_p_o_r_t routine is used to obtain a socket with a
     privileged address bound to it.  This socket is suitable for
     use by _r_c_m_d and several other routines.  Privileged Internet
     ports are those in the range 0 to 1023.  Only the super-user
     is allowed to bind an address of this sort to a socket.

     _R_u_s_e_r_o_k takes a remote host's name, as returned by a
     _g_e_t_h_o_s_t_b_y_a_d_d_r(3N) routine, two user names and a flag indi-
     cating whether the local user's name is that of the super-
     user.  It then checks the files /_e_t_c/_h_o_s_t_s._e_q_u_i_v and, possi-
     bly, ._r_h_o_s_t_s in the local user's home directory to see if
     the request for service is allowed.  A 0 is returned if the
     machine name is listed in the ``hosts.equiv'' file, or the
     host and remote user name are found in the ``.rhosts'' file;
     otherwise _r_u_s_e_r_o_k returns -1.  If the _s_u_p_e_r_u_s_e_r flag is 1,
     the checking of the ``hosts.equiv'' file is bypassed.  If
     the local domain (as obtained from _g_e_t_h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e(2)) is the
     same as the remote domain, only the machine name need be
     specified.

     _R_c_m_d returns a valid socket descriptor on success.  It
     returns -1 on error and prints a diagnostic message on the
     standard error.

     _R_r_e_s_v_p_o_r_t returns a valid, bound socket descriptor on suc-
     cess.  It returns -1 on error with the global value _e_r_r_n_o
     set according to the reason for failure.  The error code
     EAGAIN is overloaded to mean ``All network ports in use.''
