     _S_c_a_n_f reads from the standard input stream ssttddiinn.	_F_s_c_a_n_f
     reads from the named input _s_t_r_e_a_m.  _S_s_c_a_n_f reads from the
     character string _s.  Each function reads characters, inter-
     prets them according to a format, and stores the results in
     its arguments.  Each expects as arguments a control string
     _f_o_r_m_a_t, described below, and a set of _p_o_i_n_t_e_r arguments
     indicating where the converted input should be stored.

     The control string usually contains conversion specifica-
     tions, which are used to direct interpretation of input
     sequences.  The control string may contain:

     1.  Blanks, tabs or newlines, which match optional white
	 space in the input.

     2.  An ordinary character (not %) which must match the next
	 character of the input stream.

     3.  Conversion specifications, consisting of the character
	 %%, an optional assignment suppressing character **, an
	 optional numerical maximum field width, and a conversion
	 character.

     A conversion specification directs the conversion of the
     next input field; the result is placed in the variable
     pointed to by the corresponding argument, unless assignment
     suppression was indicated by **.  An input field is defined
     as a string of non-space characters; it extends to the next
     inappropriate character or until the field width, if speci-
     fied, is exhausted.

     The conversion character indicates the interpretation of the
     input field; the corresponding pointer argument must usually
     be of a restricted type.  The following conversion charac-
     ters are legal:

     %%	 a single `%' is expected in the input at this point; no
	 assignment is done.

     dd	 a decimal integer is expected; the corresponding argu-
	 ment should be an integer pointer.

     oo	 an octal integer is expected; the corresponding argument
	 should be a integer pointer.

     xx	 a hexadecimal integer is expected; the corresponding
	 argument should be an integer pointer.

     ss	 a character string is expected; the corresponding argu-
	 ment should be a character pointer pointing to an array
	 of characters large enough to accept the string and a
	 terminating `\0', which will be added.  The input field
	 is terminated by a space character or a newline.

     cc	 a character is expected; the corresponding argument
	 should be a character pointer.  The normal skip over
	 space characters is suppressed in this case; to read the
	 next non-space character, try `%1s'.  If a field width
	 is given, the corresponding argument should refer to a
	 character array, and the indicated number of characters
	 is read.

     ee
	  ff
	       a floating point number is expected; the next field is
	 converted accordingly and stored through the correspond-
	 ing argument, which should be a pointer to a _f_l_o_a_t.  The
	 input format for floating point numbers is an optionally
	 signed string of digits possibly containing a decimal
	 point, followed by an optional exponent field consisting
	 of an E or e followed by an optionally signed integer.

     [[	 indicates a string not to be delimited by space charac-
	 ters.	The left bracket is followed by a set of charac-
	 ters and a right bracket; the characters between the
	 brackets define a set of characters making up the
	 string.  If the first character is not circumflex (^),
	 the input field is all characters until the first char-
	 acter not in the set between the brackets; if the first
	 character after the left bracket is ^, the input field
	 is all characters until the first character which is in
	 the remaining set of characters between the brackets.
	 The corresponding argument must point to a character
	 array.

     The conversion characters dd, oo and xx may be capitalized or
     preceded by ll to indicate that a pointer to lloonngg rather than
     to iinntt is in the argument list.  Similarly, the conversion
     characters ee or ff may be capitalized or preceded by ll to
     indicate a pointer to ddoouubbllee rather than to ffllooaatt.  The

     conversion characters dd, oo and xx may be preceded by hh to
     indicate a pointer to sshhoorrtt rather than to iinntt.

     The _s_c_a_n_f functions return the number of successfully
     matched and assigned input items.	This can be used to
     decide how many input items were found.  The constant EEOOFF is
     returned upon end of input; note that this is different from
     0, which means that no conversion was done; if conversion
     was intended, it was frustrated by an inappropriate charac-
     ter in the input.

     For example, the call

	       int i; float x; char name[50];
	       scanf("%d%f%s", &i, &x, name);

     with the input line

	  25   54.32E-1  thompson

     will assign to _i the value 25, _x the value 5.432, and _n_a_m_e
     will contain `_t_h_o_m_p_s_o_n_\_0'.  Or,

	  int i; float x; char name[50];
	  scanf("%2d%f%*d%[1234567890]", &i, &x, name);

     with input

	  56789 0123 56a72

     will assign 56 to _i, 789.0 to _x, skip `0123', and place the
     string `56\0' in _n_a_m_e.  The next call to _g_e_t_c_h_a_r will return
     `a'.

     The _s_c_a_n_f functions return EEOOFF on end of input, and a short
     count for missing or illegal data items.

     The success of literal matches and suppressed assignments is
     not directly determinable.
