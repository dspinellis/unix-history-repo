     ttys - terminal initialization data

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The _t_t_y_s file contains information that is used by various
     routines to initialize and control the use of terminal spe-
     cial files. This information is read with the _g_e_t_t_t_y_e_n_t(3)
     library routines.	There is one line in the _t_t_y_s file per
     special file.  Fields are separated by tabs and/or spaces.
     Some fields may contain more than one word and should be
     enclosed in double quotes.  Blank lines and comments can
     appear anywhere in the file; comments are delimited by `#'
     and new line. Unspecified fields default to null.	The first
     field is the terminal's entry in the device directory, /dev.
     The second field of the file is the command to execute for
     the line, typically _g_e_t_t_y(8), which performs such tasks as
     baud-rate recognition, reading the login name, and calling
     _l_o_g_i_n(1).	It can be, however, any desired command, for
     example the start up for a window system terminal emulator
     or some other daemon process, and can contain multiple words
     if quoted.  The third field is the type of terminal normally
     connected to that tty line, as found in the _t_e_r_m_c_a_p(5) data
     base file.  The remaining fields set flags in the _t_y__s_t_a_t_u_s
     entry (see _g_e_t_t_t_y_e_n_t(3)) or specify a window system process
     that _i_n_i_t(8) will maintain for the terminal line.	As flag
     values, the strings `on' and `off' specify whether _i_n_i_t
     should execute the command given in the second field, while
     `secure' in addition to `on' allows root to login on this
     line.  These flag fields should not be quoted.  The string
     `window=' is followed by a quoted command string which _i_n_i_t
     will execute before starting _g_e_t_t_y.  If the line ends in a
     comment, the comment is included in the _t_y__c_o_m_m_e_n_t field of
     the ttyent structure.

     Some examples:

     console "/etc/getty std.1200"   vt100	  on secure
     ttyd0   "/etc/getty d1200"      dialup	  on	 # 555-1234
     ttyh0   "/etc/getty std.9600"   hp2621-nl	  on	 # 254MC
     ttyh1   "/etc/getty std.9600"   plugboard	  on	 # John's office
     ttyp0   none		     network
     ttyp1   none		     network	  off
     ttyv0   "/usr/new/xterm -L :0"  vs100	  on window="/usr/new/Xvs100 0"

     The first example permits root login on the console at 1200
     baud, the second allows dialup at 1200 baud without root
     login, the third and fourth allow login at 9600 baud with
     terminal types of "hp2621-nl" and "plugboard" respectively,
     the fifth and sixth line are examples of network pseudo
     ttys, which should not have _g_e_t_t_y enabled on them, and the
     last example shows a terminal emulator and window system
     startup entry.
