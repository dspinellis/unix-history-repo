     The fonts for the printer/plotters have the following for-
     mat.  Each file contains a header, an array of 256 character
     description structures, and then the bit maps for the char-
     acters themselves.  The header has the following format:

	  struct header {
		  short           magic;
		  unsigned short  size;
		  short           maxx;
		  short           maxy;
		  short           xtnd;
	  } header;

     The _m_a_g_i_c number is 0436 (octal).	The _m_a_x_x, _m_a_x_y, and _x_t_n_d
     fields are not used at the current time.  _M_a_x_x and _m_a_x_y are
     intended to be the maximum horizontal and vertical size of
     any glyph in the font, in raster lines.  The _s_i_z_e is the
     size of the bit maps for the characters in bytes.	Before
     the maps for the characters is an array of 256 structures
     for each of the possible characters in the font.  Each ele-
     ment of the array has the form:

	  struct dispatch {
		  unsigned short  addr;
		  short           nbytes;
		  char		  up;
		  char		  down;
		  char		  left;
		  char		  right;
		  short           width;
	  };

     The _n_b_y_t_e_s field is nonzero for characters which actually
     exist.  For such characters, the _a_d_d_r field is an offset
     into the rest of the file where the data for that character
     begins.  There are _u_p+_d_o_w_n rows of data for each character,
     each of which has _l_e_f_t+_r_i_g_h_t bits, rounded up to a number of
     bytes.  The _w_i_d_t_h field is not used by vcat, although it is
     to make width tables for _t_r_o_f_f.  It represents the logical
     width of the glyph, in raster lines, and shows where the
     base point of the next glyph would be.
