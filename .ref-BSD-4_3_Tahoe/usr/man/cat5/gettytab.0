     _G_e_t_t_y_t_a_b is a simplified version of the _t_e_r_m_c_a_p(5) data base
     used to describe terminal lines.  The initial terminal login
     process _g_e_t_t_y(8) accesses the _g_e_t_t_y_t_a_b file each time it
     starts, allowing simpler reconfiguration of terminal charac-
     teristics.  Each entry in the data base is used to describe
     one class of terminals.

     There is a default terminal class, _d_e_f_a_u_l_t, that is used to
     set global defaults for all other classes.  (That is, the
     _d_e_f_a_u_l_t entry is read, then the entry for the class required
     is used to override particular settings.)

     Refer to _t_e_r_m_c_a_p(5) for a description of the file layout.
     The _d_e_f_a_u_l_t column below lists defaults obtained if there is
     no entry in the table obtained, nor one in the special
     _d_e_f_a_u_l_t table.

     xf     str   ^S		 XOFF (stop output) character
     xn     str   ^Q		 XON (start output) character

     If no line speed is specified, speed will not be altered
     from that which prevails when getty is entered.  Specifying
     an input or output speed will override line speed for stated
     direction only.

     Terminal modes to be used for the output of the message, for
     input of the login name, and to leave the terminal set as
     upon completion, are derived from the boolean flags speci-
     fied.  If the derivation should prove inadequate, any (or
     all) of these three may be overriden with one of the ff00, ff11,
     or ff22 numeric specifications, which can be used to specify
     (usually in octal, with a leading '0') the exact values of
     the flags.  Local (new tty) flags are set in the top 16 bits
     of this (32 bit) value.

     Should _g_e_t_t_y receive a null character (presumed to indicate
     a line break) it will restart using the table indicated by
     the nnxx entry. If there is none, it will re-use its original
     table.

GETTYTAB(5)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	      GETTYTAB(5)



     Delays are specified in milliseconds, the nearest possible
     delay available in the tty driver will be used.  Should
     greater certainty be desired, delays with values 0, 1, 2,
     and 3 are interpreted as choosing that particular delay
     algorithm from the driver.

     The ccll screen clear string may be preceded by a (decimal)
     number of milliseconds of delay required (a la termcap).
     This delay is simulated by repeated use of the pad character
     ppcc.

     The initial message, and login message, iimm and llmm may
     include the character sequence %%hh or %%tt to obtain the host-
     name or tty name respectively.  (%%%% obtains a single '%'
     character.) The hostname is normally obtained from the sys-
     tem, but may be set by the hhnn table entry.  In either case
     it may be edited with hhee.	The hhee string is a sequence of
     characters, each character that is neither '@' nor '#' is
     copied into the final hostname.  A '@' in the hhee string,
     causes one character from the real hostname to be copied to
     the final hostname.  A '#' in the hhee string, causes the next
     character of the real hostname to be skipped.  Surplus '@'
     and '#' characters are ignored.

     When getty execs the login process, given in the lloo string
     (usually "/bin/login"), it will have set the enviroment to
     include the terminal type, as indicated by the tttt string (if
     it exists).  The eevv string, can be used to enter additional
     data into the environment.  It is a list of comma separated
     strings, each of which will presumably be of the form
     _n_a_m_e=_v_a_l_u_e.

     If a non-zero timeout is specified, with ttoo, then getty will
     exit within the indicated number of seconds, either having
     received a login name and passed control to _l_o_g_i_n, or having
     received an alarm signal, and exited.  This may be useful to
     hangup dial in lines.

     Output from _g_e_t_t_y is even parity unless oopp is specified.  OOpp
     may be specified with aapp to allow any parity on input, but
     generate odd parity output.  Note: this only applies while
     getty is being run, terminal driver limitations prevent a
     more complete implementation.  _G_e_t_t_y does not check parity
     of input characters in _R_A_W mode.

     The special characters (erase, kill, etc.) are reset to sys-
     tem defaults by _l_o_g_i_n(1).	In aallll cases, '#' or '^H' typed
     in a login name will be treated as an erase character, and

     '@' will be treated as a kill character.

     The delay stuff is a real crock.  Apart form its general
     lack of flexibility, some of the delay algorithms are not
     implemented.  The terminal driver should support sane delay
     settings.

     The hhee capability is stupid.

     _T_e_r_m_c_a_p format is horrid, something more rational should
     have been chosen.
