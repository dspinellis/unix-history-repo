     Every file system storage volume (disk, nine-track tape, for
     instance) has a common format for certain vital information.
     Every such volume is divided into a certain number of
     blocks.  The block size is a parameter of the file system.
     Sectors beginning at BBLOCK and continuing for BBSIZE are
     used to contain a label and for some hardware primary and
     secondary bootstrapping programs.

     The actual file system begins at sector SBLOCK with the
     _s_u_p_e_r _b_l_o_c_k that is of size SBSIZE.  The layout of the super
     block as defined by the include file <_s_y_s/_f_s._h> is:

     };

     Each disk drive contains some number of file systems.  A
     file system consists of a number of cylinder groups.  Each
     cylinder group has inodes and data.

     A file system is described by its super-block, which in turn
     describes the cylinder groups.  The super-block is critical
     data and is replicated in each cylinder group to protect
     against catastrophic loss.  This is done at file system
     creation time and the critical super-block data does not
     change, so the copies need not be referenced further unless
     disaster strikes.

     Addresses stored in inodes are capable of addressing frag-
     ments of `blocks'. File system blocks of at most size
     MAXBSIZE can be optionally broken into 2, 4, or 8 pieces,
     each of which is addressable; these pieces may be DEV_BSIZE,
     or some multiple of a DEV_BSIZE unit.

     Large files consist of exclusively large data blocks.  To
     avoid undue wasted disk space, the last data block of a
     small file is allocated as only as many fragments of a large
     block as are necessary.  The file system format retains only
     a single pointer to such a fragment, which is a piece of a
     single large block that has been divided.	The size of such
     a fragment is determinable from information in the inode,
     using the ``blksize(fs, ip, lbn)'' macro.

     The file system records space availability at the fragment
     level; to determine block availability, aligned fragments
     are examined.

     The root inode is the root of the file system.  Inode 0
     can't be used for normal purposes and historically bad
     blocks were linked to inode 1, thus the root inode is 2
     (inode 1 is no longer used for this purpose, however
     numerous dump tapes make this assumption, so we are stuck
     with it).

     _f_s__m_i_n_f_r_e_e gives the minimum acceptable percentage of file
     system blocks that may be free. If the freelist drops below
     this level only the super-user may continue to allocate
     blocks.  _F_s__m_i_n_f_r_e_e may be set to 0 if no reserve of free
     blocks is deemed necessary, however severe performance
     degradations will be observed if the file system is run at
     greater than 90% full; thus the default value of _f_s__m_i_n_f_r_e_e
     is 10%.

     Empirically the best trade-off between block fragmentation
     and overall disk utilization at a loading of 90% comes with
     a fragmentation of 8, thus the default fragment size is an

     eighth of the block size.

     _f_s__o_p_t_i_m specifies whether the file system should try to
     minimize the time spent allocating blocks, or if it should
     attempt to minimize the space fragmentation on the disk.  If
     the value of fs_minfree (see above) is less than 10%, then
     the file system defaults to optimizing for space to avoid
     running out of full sized blocks.	If the value of minfree
     is greater than or equal to 10%, fragmentation is unlikely
     to be problematical, and the file system defaults to optim-
     izing for time.

     _C_y_l_i_n_d_e_r _g_r_o_u_p _r_e_l_a_t_e_d _l_i_m_i_t_s: Each cylinder keeps track of
     the availability of blocks at different rotational posi-
     tions, so that sequential blocks can be laid out with
     minimum rotational latency. With the default of 8 dis-
     tinguished rotational positions, the resolution of the sum-
     mary information is 2ms for a typical 3600 rpm drive.

     _f_s__r_o_t_d_e_l_a_y gives the minimum number of milliseconds to ini-
     tiate another disk transfer on the same cylinder.	It is
     used in determining the rotationally optimal layout for disk
     blocks within a file; the default value for _f_s__r_o_t_d_e_l_a_y is
     2ms.

     Each file system has a statically allocated number of
     inodes.  An inode is allocated for each NBPI bytes of disk
     space.  The inode allocation strategy is extremely conserva-
     tive.

     MINBSIZE is the smallest allowable block size.  With a
     MINBSIZE of 4096 it is possible to create files of size 2^32
     with only two levels of indirection.  MINBSIZE must be big
     enough to hold a cylinder group block, thus changes to
     (struct cg) must keep its size within MINBSIZE.  Note that
     super blocks are never more than size SBSIZE.

     The path name on which the file system is mounted is main-
     tained in _f_s__f_s_m_n_t.  MAXMNTLEN defines the amount of space
     allocated in the super block for this name.  The limit on
     the amount of summary information per file system is defined
     by MAXCSBUFS.  For a 4096 byte block size, it is currently
     parameterized for a maximum of two million cylinders.

     Per cylinder group information is summarized in blocks allo-
     cated from the first cylinder group's data blocks. These
     blocks are read in from _f_s__c_s_a_d_d_r (size _f_s__c_s_s_i_z_e) in addi-
     tion to the super block.

     NN..BB..:: sizeof (struct csum) must be a power of two in order
     for the ``fs_cs'' macro to work.

     _S_u_p_e_r _b_l_o_c_k _f_o_r _a _f_i_l_e _s_y_s_t_e_m: The size of the rotational
     layout tables is limited by the fact that the super block is
     of size SBSIZE.  The size of these tables is iinnvveerrsseellyy pro-
     portional to the block size of the file system. The size of
     the tables is increased when sector sizes are not powers of
     two, as this increases the number of cylinders included
     before the rotational pattern repeats ( _f_s__c_p_c).  The size
     of the rotational layout tables is derived from the number
     of bytes remaining in (struct fs).

     The number of blocks of data per cylinder group is limited
     because cylinder groups are at most one block.  The inode
     and free block tables must fit into a single block after
     deducting space for the cylinder group structure (struct
     cg).

     _I_n_o_d_e: The inode is the focus of all file activity in the
     UNIX file system.	There is a unique inode allocated for
     each active file, each current directory, each mounted-on
     file, text file, and the root.  An inode is `named' by its
     device/i-number pair.  For further information, see the
     include file <_s_y_s/_i_n_o_d_e._h>.
