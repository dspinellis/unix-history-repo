     The time zone information files used by _t_z_s_e_t(3) begin with
     bytes reserved for future use, followed by three four-byte
     values of type lloonngg, written in a ``standard'' byte order
     (the high-order byte of the value is written first).  These
     values are, in order:

     _t_z_h__t_i_m_e_c_n_t
	  The number of "transition times" for which data is
	  stored in the file.

     _t_z_h__t_y_p_e_c_n_t
	  The number of "local time types" for which data is
	  stored in the file (must not be zero).

     _t_z_h__c_h_a_r_c_n_t
	  The number of characters of "time zone abbreviation
	  strings" stored in the file.

     The above header is followed by _t_z_h__t_i_m_e_c_n_t four-byte values
     of type lloonngg, sorted in ascending order.  These values are
     written in ``standard'' byte order.  Each is used as a tran-
     sition time (as returned by _t_i_m_e(2)) at which the rules for
     computing local time change.  Next come _t_z_h__t_i_m_e_c_n_t one-byte
     values of type uunnssiiggnneedd cchhaarr; each one tells which of the
     different types of ``local time'' types described in the
     file is associated with the same-indexed transition time.
     These values serve as indices into an array of _t_t_i_n_f_o struc-
     tures that appears next in the file; these structures are
     defined as follows:

	  struct ttinfo {
	       long	     tt_gmtoff;
	       int	     tt_isdst;
	       unsigned int  tt_abbrind;
	  };

     Each structure is written as a four-byte value for _t_t__g_m_t_o_f_f
     of type lloonngg, in a standard byte order, followed by a one-
     byte value for _t_t__i_s_d_s_t and a one-byte value for _t_t__a_b_b_r_i_n_d.
     In each structure, _t_t__g_m_t_o_f_f gives the number of seconds to
     be added to GMT, _t_t__i_s_d_s_t tells whether _t_m__i_s_d_s_t should be
     set by _l_o_c_a_l_t_i_m_e (_3) and _t_t__a_b_b_r_i_n_d serves as an index into
     the array of time zone abbreviation characters that follow
     the _t_t_i_n_f_o structure(s) in the file.

     _L_o_c_a_l_t_i_m_e uses the first standard-time _t_t_i_n_f_o structure in
     the file (or simply the first _t_t_i_n_f_o structure in the
     absence of a standard-time structure) if either _t_z_h__t_i_m_e_c_n_t
     is zero or the time argument is less than the first transi-
     tion time recorded in the file.
