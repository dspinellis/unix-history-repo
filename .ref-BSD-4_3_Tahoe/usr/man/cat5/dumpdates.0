     #define   DUMPOUTFMT     "%-16s %c %s"	  /* for printf */

     #define   DUMPINFMT "%16s %c %[^\n]\n"  /* inverse for scanf */

     NTREC is the number of 1024 byte records in a physical tape
     block.  MLEN is the number of bits in a bit map word.  MSIZ
     is the number of bit map words.

     The TS_ entries are used in the _c__t_y_p_e field to indicate
     what sort of header this is.  The types and their meanings
     are as follows:

     TS_TAPE	  Tape volume label
     TS_INODE	  A file or directory follows.	The _c__d_i_n_o_d_e
		  field is a copy of the disk inode and contains
		  bits telling what sort of file this is.
     TS_BITS	  A bit map follows.  This bit map has a one bit
		  for each inode that was dumped.
     TS_ADDR	  A subrecord of a file description.  See _c__a_d_d_r
		  below.
     TS_END	  End of tape record.
     TS_CLRI	  A bit map follows.  This bit map contains a
		  zero bit for all inodes that were empty on the
		  file system when dumped.
     MAGIC	  All header records have this number in _c__m_a_g_i_c.
     CHECKSUM	  Header records checksum to this value.

     The fields of the header structure are as follows:

     c_type	  The type of the header.
     c_date	  The date the dump was taken.
     c_ddate	  The date the file system was dumped from.
     c_volume	  The current volume number of the dump.
     c_tapea	  The current number of this (1024-byte) record.
     c_inumber	  The number of the inode being dumped if this is
		  of type TS_INODE.
     c_magic	  This contains the value MAGIC above, truncated
		  as needed.
     c_checksum   This contains whatever value is needed to make
		  the record sum to CHECKSUM.
     c_dinode	  This is a copy of the inode as it appears on
		  the file system; see _f_s(5).
     c_count	  The count of characters in _c__a_d_d_r.
     c_addr	  An array of characters describing the blocks of
		  the dumped file.  A character is zero if the
		  block associated with that character was not
		  present on the file system, otherwise the char-
		  acter is non-zero.  If the block was not
		  present on the file system, no block was
		  dumped; the block will be restored as a hole in
		  the file.  If there is not sufficient space in
		  this record to describe all of the blocks in a

		  file, TS_ADDR records will be scattered through
		  the file, each one picking up where the last
		  left off.

     Each volume except the last ends with a tapemark (read as an
     end of file).  The last volume ends with a TS_END record and
     then the tapemark.

     The structure _i_d_a_t_e_s describes an entry in the file
     /_e_t_c/_d_u_m_p_d_a_t_e_s where dump history is kept.  The fields of
     the structure are:

     id_name  The dumped filesystem is `/dev/_i_d__n_a_m'.
     id_incno The level number of the dump tape; see _d_u_m_p(8).
     id_ddate The date of the incremental dump in system format
	      see _t_y_p_e_s(5).
