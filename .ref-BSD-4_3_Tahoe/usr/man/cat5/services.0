     services - service name data base

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The _s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s file contains information regarding the known
     services available in the DARPA Internet.	For each service
     a single line should be present with the following informa-
     tion:

     official service name
     port number
     protocol name
     aliases

     Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab char-
     acters.  The port number and protocol name are considered a
     single _i_t_e_m; a ``/'' is used to separate the port and proto-
     col (e.g. ``512/tcp'').  A ``#'' indicates the beginning of
     a comment; subsequent characters up to the end of the line
     are not interpreted by the routines which search the file.

     Service names may contain any printable character other than
     a field delimiter, newline, or comment character.
