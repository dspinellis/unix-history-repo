     The resolver configuration file contains information that is
     read by the resolver routines the first time they are
     invoked by a process.  The file is designed to be human
     readable and contains a list of name-value pairs that pro-
     vide various types of resolver information.

     On a normally configured system this file should not be
     necessary.  The only name server to be queried will be on
     the local machine and the domain name is retrieved from the
     system.

     The different configuration options are:

     nnaammeesseerrvveerr
	  followed by the Internet address (in dot notation) of a
	  name server that the resolver should query.  At least
	  one name server should be listed.  Up to MAXNS
	  (currently 3) name servers may be listed, in that case
	  the resolver library queries tries them in the order
	  listed.  If no nnaammeesseerrvveerr entries are present, the
	  default is to use the name server on the local machine.
	  (The algorithm used is to try a name server, and if the
	  query times out, try the next, until out of name
	  servers, then repeat trying all the name servers until
	  a maximum number of retries are made).

     ddoommaaiinn
	  followed by a domain name, that is the default domain
	  to append to names that do not have a dot in them.  If
	  no ddoommaaiinn entries are present, the domain returned by
	  _g_e_t_h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e(2) is used (everything after the first
	  `.').  Finally, if the host name does not contain a
	  domain part, the root domain is assumed.

     The name value pair must appear on a single line, and the
     keyword (e.g. nnaammeesseerrvveerr) must start the line.  The value
     follows the keyword, separated by white space.
