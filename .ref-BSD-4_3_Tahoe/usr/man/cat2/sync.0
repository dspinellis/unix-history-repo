     _S_y_n_c causes all information in core memory that should be on
     disk to be written out.  This includes modified super
     blocks, modified i-nodes, and delayed block I/O.

     _S_y_n_c should be used by programs that examine a file system,
     for example _f_s_c_k, _d_f, etc.  _S_y_n_c is mandatory before a boot.

BBUUGGSS
     The writing, although scheduled, is not necessarily complete
     upon return from _s_y_n_c.
