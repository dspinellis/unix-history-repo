     Limits on the consumption of system resources by the current
     process and each process it creates may be obtained with the
     _g_e_t_r_l_i_m_i_t call, and set with the _s_e_t_r_l_i_m_i_t call.

     The _r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e parameter is one of the following:

     RLIMIT_CPU       the maximum amount of cpu time (in seconds)
		      to be used by each process.

     RLIMIT_FSIZE     the largest size, in bytes, of any single
		      file that may be created.

     RLIMIT_DATA      the maximum size, in bytes, of the data
		      segment for a process; this defines how far
		      a program may extend its break with the
		      _s_b_r_k(2) system call.

     RLIMIT_STACK     the maximum size, in bytes, of the stack
		      segment for a process; this defines how far
		      a program's stack segment may be extended.
		      Stack extension is performed automatically
		      by the system.

     RLIMIT_CORE      the largest size, in bytes, of a _c_o_r_e file
		      that may be created.

     RLIMIT_RSS       the maximum size, in bytes, to which a
		      process's resident set size may grow.  This
		      imposes a limit on the amount of physical
		      memory to be given to a process; if memory
		      is tight, the system will prefer to take
		      memory from processes that are exceeding
		      their declared resident set size.

     A resource limit is specified as a soft limit and a hard
     limit.  When a soft limit is exceeded a process may receive
     a signal (for example, if the cpu time or file size is
     exceeded), but it will be allowed to continue execution
     until it reaches the hard limit (or modifies its resource
     limit).  The _r_l_i_m_i_t structure is used to specify the hard
     and soft limits on a resource,

	  struct rlimit {
	       int  rlim_cur; /* current (soft) limit */
	       int  rlim_max; /* hard limit */
	  };

     Only the super-user may raise the maximum limits.	Other
     users may only alter _r_l_i_m__c_u_r within the range from 0 to
     _r_l_i_m__m_a_x or (irreversibly) lower _r_l_i_m__m_a_x.

     An "infinite" value for a limit is defined as RLIM_INFINITY
     (0x7fffffff).

     Because this information is stored in the per-process infor-
     mation, this system call must be executed directly by the
     shell if it is to affect all future processes created by the
     shell; _l_i_m_i_t is thus a built-in command to _c_s_h(1).

     The system refuses to extend the data or stack space when
     the limits would be exceeded in the normal way: a _b_r_e_a_k call
     fails if the data space limit is reached.	When the stack
     limit is reached, the process receives a segmentation fault
     (SIGSEGV); if this signal is not caught by a handler using
     the signal stack, this signal will kill the process.

     A file I/O operation that would create a file larger that
     the process' soft limit will cause the write to fail and a
     signal SIGXFSZ to be generated; this normally terminates the
     process, but may be caught.  When the soft cpu time limit is
     exceeded, a signal SIGXCPU is sent to the offending process.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEE
     A 0 return value indicates that the call succeeded, changing
     or returning the resource limit.	A return value of -1
     indicates that an error occurred, and an error code is
     stored in the global location _e_r_r_n_o.

EERRRROORRSS
     The possible errors are:

     [EFAULT]	    The address specified for _r_l_p is invalid.

     [EPERM]   The limit specified to _s_e_t_r_l_i_m_i_t would have
		    raised the maximum limit value, and the
		    caller is not the super-user.
