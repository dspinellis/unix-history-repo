     The real and effective user ID's of the current process are
     set according to the arguments.  If _r_u_i_d or _e_u_i_d is -1, the
     current uid is filled in by the system.  Unprivileged users
     may change the real user ID to the effective user ID and
     vice-versa; only the super-user may make other changes.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEE
     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Oth-
     erwise, a value of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indi-
     cate the error.

     [EPERM]	    The current process is not the super-user and
		    a change other than changing the effective
		    user-id to the real user-id was specified.
