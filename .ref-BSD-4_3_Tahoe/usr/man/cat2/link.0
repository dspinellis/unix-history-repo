     A hard link to _n_a_m_e_1 is created; the link has the name
     _n_a_m_e_2.  _N_a_m_e_1 must exist.

     With hard links, both _n_a_m_e_1 and _n_a_m_e_2 must be in the same
     file system.  Unless the caller is the super-user, _n_a_m_e_1
     must not be a directory.  Both the old and the new _l_i_n_k
     share equal access and rights to the underlying object.

     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Oth-
     erwise, a value of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indi-
     cate the error.

EERRRROORRSS
     _L_i_n_k will fail and no link will be created if one or more of
     the following are true:

     [ENOTDIR]	    A component of either path prefix is not a
		    directory.

     [EINVAL]	    Either pathname contains a character with the
		    high-order bit set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG] A component of either pathname exceeded 255
		    characters, or entire length of either path
		    name exceeded 1023 characters.

     [ENOENT]	    A component of either path prefix does not
		    exist.

     [EACCES]	    A component of either path prefix denies
		    search permission.

     [EACCES]	    The requested link requires writing in a
		    directory with a mode that denies write per-
		    mission.

     [ELOOP]	    Too many symbolic links were encountered in
		    translating one of the pathnames.

     [ENOENT]	    The file named by _n_a_m_e_1 does not exist.

     [EEXIST]	    The link named by _n_a_m_e_2 does exist.

     [EPERM]	    The file named by _n_a_m_e_1 is a directory and
		    the effective user ID is not super-user.

     [EXDEV]	    The link named by _n_a_m_e_2 and the file named by
		    _n_a_m_e_1 are on different file systems.

     [ENOSPC]	    The directory in which the entry for the new
		    link is being placed cannot be extended
		    because there is no space left on the file
		    system containing the directory.

     [EDQUOT]	    The directory in which the entry for the new
		    link is being placed cannot be extended
		    because the user's quota of disk blocks on
		    the file system containing the directory has
		    been exhausted.

     [EIO]	    An I/O error occurred while reading from or
		    writing to the file system to make the direc-
		    tory entry.

     [EROFS]	    The requested link requires writing in a
		    directory on a read-only file system.

     [EFAULT]	    One of the pathnames specified is outside the
		    process's allocated address space.
