     _U_m_a_s_k sets the process's file mode creation mask to _n_u_m_a_s_k
     and returns the previous value of the mask.  The low-order 9
     bits of _n_u_m_a_s_k are used whenever a file is created, clearing
     corresponding bits in the file mode (see _c_h_m_o_d(2)).  This
     clearing allows each user to restrict the default access to
     his files.

     The value is initially 022 (write access for owner only).
     The mask is inherited by child processes.

     The previous value of the file mode mask is returned by the
     call.
