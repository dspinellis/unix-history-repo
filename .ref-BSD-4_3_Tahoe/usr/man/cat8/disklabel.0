     _D_i_s_k_l_a_b_e_l can be used to install, examine or modify the
     label on a disk drive or pack.  When writing the label, it
     can be used to change the drive identification, the disk
     partitions on the drive, or to replace a damaged label or
     bootstrap.  The disk label is located on one of the first
     sectors of each disk (usually block 0).  On machines that
     require a block-0 bootstrap (VAX 11/750), the label is
     inserted into the bootstrap program.  This information is
     used by the system disk driver and by the bootstrap program
     to determine how to program the drive.  There are several
     forms of the command that display, install or modify the
     label on a disk.  Each form has an additional option, --rr,
     which causes the label to be read from or written to the
     disk directly, rather than going through the system's in-
     core copy of the label.  When writing, the in-core copy is
     also updated if possible.	This option may allow a label to
     be installed on a disk without kernel support for a label,
     such as when labels are first installed on a system; it must
     be used when first installing a label on a disk.

     The first form of the command is used to examine the label
     on the named disk drive (e.g. hp0 or /dev/rhp0c).	It will
     display all of the parameters associated with the drive and
     its partition layout.  Unless the --rr flag is given, the
     kernel's in-core copy of the label is displayed; if the disk
     has no label, or the partition types on the disk are
     incorrect, the kernel may have constructed or modified the
     label.  If the --rr flag is given, the label from the raw disk
     will be displayed rather than the in-core label.

     The second form of the command, with the --ww flag, is used to
     write a standard label on the designated drive.  The
     required arguments to _d_i_s_k_l_a_b_e_l are the drive to be labelled
     (e.g. hp0), and the drive type as described in the _d_i_s_k_-
     _t_a_b(5) file.  The drive parameters and partitions are taken
     from that file.  If different disks of the same physical
     type are to have different partitions, it will be necessary
     to have separate disktab entries describing each, or to edit
     the label after installation as described below.  The first
     optional argument is a pack identification string, up to 16

     characters long.  The pack id must be quoted if it contains
     blanks.  If the --rr flag is given, the disk sectors contain-
     ing the label and bootstrap will be written directly, other-
     wise the existing label will be updated in place without
     modifying the bootstrap.  If the disk does not already have
     a label, the --rr flag must be used.  In either case, the
     kernel's in-core label is replaced.

     Alternate versions of the bootstrap files may be specified
     after the pack identifier.  If an alternate bootstrap is not
     specified, the standard bootstrap will be used.  The
     bootstrap programs are located in /_u_s_r/_m_d_e_c.  The names of
     the bootstrap programs may be specified in _d_i_s_k_t_a_b(5); if
     not specified, the default names are of the form
     _b_a_s_e_n_a_m_eboot for the primary (block 0) bootstrap, and boot-
     _b_a_s_e_n_a_m_e for the secondary (block 1-15) bootstrap; for exam-
     ple, /usr/mdec/hpboot and /usr/mdec/boothp if the disk dev-
     ice is hhpp00.

     An existing disk label may be edited by using the --ee flag.
     The label is read from the in-core kernel copy, or directly
     from the disk if the --rr flag is also given.  The label is
     formatted and then supplied to an editor for changes.  If no
     editor is specified in an EDITOR environment variable, _v_i(1)
     is used.  When the editor terminates, the formatted label is
     reread and used to rewrite the disk label.

     With the --RR flag, _d_i_s_k_l_a_b_e_l is capable of restoring a disk
     label that was formatted in a prior operation and saved in
     an ascii file.  The prototype file used to create the label
     should be in the same format as that produced when reading
     or editing a label.  Comments are delimited by ## and new-
     line.  If the --rr option is also given, a block-0 bootstrap
     is installed on machines that use one; either the disktype
     or the names of the bootstrap files must be specified on
     such machines.

     Finally, the --NNWW flags for _d_i_s_k_l_a_b_e_l explicitly disallow and
     allow, respectively, writing of the pack label area on the
     selected disk.

     changed while it is open.	Some device drivers create a
     label containing only a single large partition if a disk is
     unlabeled; thus, the label must be written to the ``a'' par-
     tition of the disk while it is open.  This sometimes
     requires the desired label to be set in two steps, the first
     one creating at least one other partition, and the second
     setting the label on the new partition while shrinking the
     ``a'' partition.

     When a disk name is given without a full pathname, the con-
     structed device name uses the ``c'' partition on the vax and
     the ``a'' partition on the tahoe.
