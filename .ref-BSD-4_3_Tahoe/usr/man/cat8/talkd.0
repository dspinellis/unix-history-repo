     _T_a_l_k_d is the server that notifies a user that somebody else
     wants to initiate a conversation.	It acts a repository of
     invitations, responding to requests by clients wishing to
     rendezvous to hold a conversation.  In normal operation, a
     client, the caller, initiates a rendezvous by sending a
     CTL_MSG to the server of type LOOK_UP (see
     <_p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l_s/_t_a_l_k_d._h>).  This causes the server to search its
     invitation tables to check if an invitation currently exists
     for the caller (to speak to the callee specified in the mes-
     sage).  If the lookup fails, the caller then sends an
     ANNOUNCE message causing the server to broadcast an
     announcement on the callee's login ports requesting contact.
     When the callee responds, the local server uses the recorded
     invitation to respond with the appropriate rendezvous
     address and the caller and callee client programs establish
     a stream connection through which the conversation takes
     place.
