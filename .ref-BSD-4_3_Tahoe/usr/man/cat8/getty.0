     _G_e_t_t_y is usually invoked by _i_n_i_t(8) to open and initialize
     the tty line, read a login name, and invoke _l_o_g_i_n(1).  _g_e_t_t_y
     attempts to adapt the system to the speed and type of termi-
     nal being used.

     The argument _t_t_y is the special device file in /dev to open
     for the terminal (e.g., ``ttyh0'').  If there is no argument
     or the argument is ``-'', the tty line is assumed to be open
     as file descriptor 0.

     The _t_y_p_e argument can be used to make _g_e_t_t_y treat the termi-
     nal line specially.  This argument is used as an index into
     the _g_e_t_t_y_t_a_b(5) database, to determine the characteristics
     of the line.  If there is no argument, or there is no such
     table, the ddeeffaauulltt table is used.	If there is no
     //eettcc//ggeettttyyttaabb a set of system defaults is used.  If indi-
     cated by the table located, _g_e_t_t_y will clear the terminal
     screen, print a banner heading, and prompt for a login name.
     Usually either the banner or the login prompt will include
     the system hostname.  Then the user's name is read, a char-
     acter at a time.  If a null character is received, it is
     assumed to be the result of the user pushing the `break'
     (`interrupt') key.  The speed is usually then changed and
     the `login:' is typed again; a second `break' changes the
     speed again and the `login:' is typed once more.  Successive
     `break' characters cycle through the same standard set of
     speeds.

     The user's name is terminated by a new-line or carriage-
     return character.	The latter results in the system being
     set to treat carriage returns appropriately (see _t_t_y(4)).

     The user's name is scanned to see if it contains any lower-
     case alphabetic characters; if not, and if the name is
     nonempty, the system is told to map any future upper-case
     characters into the corresponding lower-case characters.

     Finally, _l_o_g_i_n is called with the user's name as an argu-
     ment.

     Most of the default actions of _g_e_t_t_y can be circumvented, or
     modified, by a suitable _g_e_t_t_y_t_a_b table.

     _G_e_t_t_y can be set to timeout after some interval, which will
     cause dial up lines to hang up if the login name is not

     cannot be opened, likely because the requisite lines are
     either not configured into the system, the associated device
     was not attached during boot-time system configuration, or
     the special file in /dev does not exist.
