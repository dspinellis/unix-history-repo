     _R_m_a_i_l interprets incoming mail received via _u_u_c_p(1C), col-
     lapsing ``From'' lines in the form generated by _b_i_n_m_a_i_l(1)
     into a single line of the form ``return-path!sender'', and
     passing the processed mail on to _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l(8).

     _R_m_a_i_l is explicitly designed for use with _u_u_c_p and _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l.
