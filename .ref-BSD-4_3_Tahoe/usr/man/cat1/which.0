     _W_h_i_c_h takes a list of names and looks for the files which
     would be executed had these names been given as commands.
     Each argument is expanded if it is aliased, and searched for
     along the user's path.  Both aliases and path are taken from
     the user's .cshrc file.

     A diagnostic is given for names which are aliased to more
     than a single word, or if an executable file with the argu-
