     _K_i_l_l sends the TERM (terminate, 15) signal to the specified
     processes.  If a signal name or number preceded by `-' is
     given as first argument, that signal is sent instead of ter-
     minate (see _s_i_g_v_e_c(2)).  The signal names are listed by
     `kill -l', and are as given in /_u_s_r/_i_n_c_l_u_d_e/_s_i_g_n_a_l._h,
     stripped of the common SIG prefix.

     The terminate signal will kill processes that do not catch
     the signal; `kill -9 ...' is a sure kill, as the KILL (9)
     signal cannot be caught.  By convention, if process number 0
     is specified, all members in the process group (i.e.
     processes resulting from the current login) are signaled
     (but beware: this works only if you use _s_h(1); not if you
     use _c_s_h(1).) Negative process numbers also have special
     meanings; see _k_i_l_l(2) for details.

     The killed processes must belong to the current user unless
     he is the super-user.

     The process number of an asynchronous process started with
     `&' is reported by the shell.  Process numbers can also be
     found by using _p_s(1).  _K_i_l_l is a built-in to _c_s_h(1); it
     allows job specifiers of the form ``%...'' as arguments so
     process id's are not as often used as _k_i_l_l arguments.  See
     _c_s_h(1) for details.

     A replacement for ``kill 0'' for _c_s_h(1) users should be pro-
     vided.
