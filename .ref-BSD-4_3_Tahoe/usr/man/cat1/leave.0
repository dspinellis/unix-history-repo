     _L_e_a_v_e waits until the specified time, then reminds you that
     you have to leave.  You are reminded 5 minutes and 1 minute
     before the actual time, at the time, and every minute
     thereafter.  When you log off, _l_e_a_v_e exits just before it
     would have printed the next message.

     The time of day is in the form hhmm where hh is a time in
     hours (on a 12 or 24 hour clock).	All times are converted
     to a 12 hour clock, and assumed to be in the next 12 hours.

     If the time is preceeded by `+', the alarm will go off in
     hours and minutes from the current time.

     If no argument is given, _l_e_a_v_e prompts with "When do you
     have to leave?". A reply of newline causes _l_e_a_v_e to exit,
     otherwise the reply is assumed to be a time.  This form is
     suitable for inclusion in a ._l_o_g_i_n or ._p_r_o_f_i_l_e.

     Leave ignores interrupts, quits, and terminates.  To get rid
     of it you should either log off or use ``kill -9'' giving
     its process id.
