     _L_i_n_t attempts to detect features of the C program _f_i_l_e_s
     which are likely to be bugs, or non-portable, or wasteful.
     It also checks the type usage of the program more strictly
     than the compilers.  Among the things which are currently
     found are unreachable statements, loops not entered at the
     top, automatic variables declared and not used, and logical
     expressions whose value is constant.  Moreover, the usage of
     functions is checked to find functions which return values
     in some places and not in others, functions called with
     varying numbers of arguments, and functions whose values are
     not used.

     By default, it is assumed that all the _f_i_l_e_s are to be
     loaded together; they are checked for mutual compatibility.
     Function definitions for certain libraries are available to
     _l_i_n_t; these libraries are referred to by a conventional
     name, such as `-lm', in the style of _l_d(1).  Arguments end-
     ing in ._l_n are also treated as library files.  To create
     lint libraries, use the --CC option:

	  lint -Cfoo files . . .

     where _f_i_l_e_s are the C sources of library _f_o_o. The result is
     a file _l_l_i_b-_l_f_o_o._l_n in the correct library format suitable
     for linting programs using _f_o_o.

     Any number of the options in the following list may be used.
     The --DD, --UU, and --II options of _c_c(1) are also recognized as
     separate arguments.

     pp	  Attempt to check portability to the _I_B_M and _G_C_O_S
	  dialects of C.

     hh	  Apply a number of heuristic tests to attempt to intuit
	  bugs, improve style, and reduce waste.

     bb	  Report _b_r_e_a_k statements that cannot be reached.  (This
	  is not the default because, unfortunately, most _l_e_x and
	  many _y_a_c_c outputs produce dozens of such comments.)

     vv	  Suppress complaints about unused arguments in func-
	  tions.

     xx	  Report variables referred to by extern declarations,
	  but never used.

     aa	  Report assignments of long values to int variables.

     cc	  Complain about casts which have questionable portabil-
	  ity.

     uu	  Do not complain about functions and variables used and
	  not defined, or defined and not used (this is suitable
	  for running _l_i_n_t on a subset of files out of a larger
	  program).

     nn	  Do not check compatibility against the standard
	  library.

     zz	  Do not complain about structures that are never defined
	  (e.g.  using a structure pointer without knowing its
	  contents.).

     _E_x_i_t(2) and other functions which do not return are not
     understood; this causes various lies.

     Certain conventional comments in the C source will change
     the behavior of _l_i_n_t:

     /*NOTREACHED*/
	  at appropriate points stops comments about unreachable
	  code.

     /*VARARGS_n*/
	  suppresses the usual checking for variable numbers of
	  arguments in the following function declaration.  The
	  data types of the first _n arguments are checked; a
	  missing _n is taken to be 0.

     /*NOSTRICT*/
	  shuts off strict type checking in the next expression.

     /*ARGSUSED*/
	  turns on the --vv option for the next function.

     /*LINTLIBRARY*/
	  at the beginning of a file shuts off complaints about
	  unused functions in this file.
