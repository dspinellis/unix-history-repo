     _M_s_e_t retrieves mapping information for the ASCII keyboard to
     IBM 3270 terminal special functions.  Normally, these map-
     pings are found in /_e_t_c/_m_a_p_3_2_7_0 (see _m_a_p_3_2_7_0(5)).	This
     information is used by the _t_n_3_2_7_0 command (see _t_n_3_2_7_0(1)).

     _M_s_e_t can be used store the mapping information in the pro-
     cess environment in order to avoid scanning /_e_t_c/_m_a_p_3_2_7_0
     each time _t_n_3_2_7_0 is invoked.  To do this, place the follow-
     ing command in your ._l_o_g_i_n file:

	  set noglob; setenv MAP3270 "`mset`"; unset noglob

     _M_s_e_t first determines the user's terminal type from the
     environment variable TTEERRMM.  Normally _m_s_e_t then uses the file
     /_e_t_c/_m_a_p_3_2_7_0 to find the keyboard mapping for that terminal.
     However, if the environment variable MMAAPP33227700 exists and con-
     tains the entry for the specified terminal, then that defin-
     ition is used.  If the value of MMAAPP33227700 begins with a slash
     (`/') then it is assumed to be the full pathname of an
     alternate mapping file and that file is searched first.  In
     any case, if the mapping for the terminal is not found in
     the environment, nor in an alternate map file, nor in the
     standard map file, then the same search is performed for an
     entry for a terminal type of uunnkknnoowwnn.. If that search also
     fails, then a default mapping is used.

     If the entry for the specific terminal exceeds 1024 bytes,
     _c_s_h(1) will fail to set the environment variable.	_M_s_e_t
     should probably detect this case and output the path to the
     _m_a_p_3_2_7_0 file instead of the terminal entry.
