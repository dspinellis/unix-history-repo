     _N_i_c_e executes _c_o_m_m_a_n_d with low scheduling priority.  If the
     _n_u_m_b_e_r argument is present, the priority is incremented
     (higher numbers mean lower priorities) by that amount up to
     a limit of 20.  The default _n_u_m_b_e_r is 10.

     The super-user may run commands with priority higher than
     normal by using a negative priority, e.g. `--10'.

     _N_o_h_u_p executes _c_o_m_m_a_n_d immune to hangup and terminate sig-
     nals from the controlling terminal.  The priority is incre-
     mented by 5.  _N_o_h_u_p should be invoked from the shell with
     `&' in order to prevent it from responding to interrupts by
     or stealing the input from the next person who logs in on
     the same terminal.

     _N_i_c_e returns the exit status of the subject command.

BBUUGGSS
     _N_i_c_e and _n_o_h_u_p are particular to _s_h(1).  If you use _c_s_h(1),
     then commands executed with ``&'' are automatically immune
     to hangup signals while in the background.  There is a buil-
     tin command _n_o_h_u_p which provides immunity from terminate,
     but it does not redirect output to _n_o_h_u_p._o_u_t.

     _N_i_c_e is built into _c_s_h(1) with a slightly different syntax
     than described here.  The form ``nice +10'' nices to posi-
     tive nice, and ``nice -10'' can be used by the super-user to
     give a process more of the processor.
