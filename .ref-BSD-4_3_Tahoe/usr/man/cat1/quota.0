     _Q_u_o_t_a displays users' disc usage and limits. Only the
     super-user may use the optional _u_s_e_r argument to view the
     limits of users other than himself.

     The --qq flag prints a more terse message, containing only
     information on file systems where usage is over quota.

     If a --vv flag is supplied, _q_u_o_t_a will also display user's
     quotas on file systems where no storage is allocated.

     _Q_u_o_t_a reports only on file systems which have disc quotas.
     If _q_u_o_t_a exits with a non-zero status, one or more file sys-
     tems are over quota.
