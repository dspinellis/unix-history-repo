     _P_r_o_f interprets the file produced by the _m_o_n_i_t_o_r subroutine.
     Under default modes, the symbol table in the named object
     file (_a._o_u_t default) is read and correlated with the profile
     file (_m_o_n._o_u_t default).  For each external symbol, the per-
     centage of time spent executing between that symbol and the
     next is printed (in decreasing order), together with the
     number of times that routine was called and the number of
     milliseconds per call.  If more than one profile file is
     specified, the output represents the sum of the profiles.

     In order for the number of calls to a routine to be tallied,
     the --pp option of _c_c, _f_7_7 or _p_c must have been given when the
     file containing the routine was compiled.	This option also
     arranges for the profile file to be produced automatically.

     Options are:

     --aa   all symbols are reported rather than just external sym-
	  bols.

     --ll   the output is sorted by symbol value.

     --nn   the output is sorted by number of calls

     --ss   a summary profile file is produced in _m_o_n._s_u_m. This is
	  really only useful when more than one profile file is
	  specified.

     --vv   all printing is suppressed and a graphic version of the
	  profile is produced on the standard output for display
	  by the _p_l_o_t(1) filters.  When plotting, the numbers _l_o_w
	  and _h_i_g_h, by default 0 and 100, may be given to cause a
	  selected percentage of the profile to be plotted with
	  accordingly higher resolution.

     --zz   routines which have zero usage (as indicated by call
	  counts and accumulated time) are nevertheless printed
	  in the output.
