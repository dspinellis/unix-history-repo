     _E_f_l compiles a program written in the EFL language into
     clean Fortran.  _E_f_l provides the same control flow con-
     structs as does _r_a_t_f_o_r(1), which are essentially identical
     to those in C:

     statement grouping with braces;
	  decision-making with if, if-else, and switch-case;
	  while, for, Fortran do, repeat, and repeat...until
	  loops; multi-level break and next.  In addition, EFL
	  has C-like data structures, and more uniform and con-
	  venient input/output syntax, generic functions.  EFL
	  also provides some syntactic sugar to make programs
	  easier to read and write:

     free form input:
	  multiple statements/line; automatic continuation state-
	  ment label names (not just numbers),

     comments:
	  # this is a comment

     translation of relationals:
	  >, >=, etc., become .GT., .GE., etc.

     return (expression)
	  returns expression to caller from function

     define:
	  define name replacement

     include:
	  include filename

     The Efl command option --ww suppresses warning messages.  The
     option --CC causes comments to be copied through to the For-
     tran output (default); --## prevents comments from being
     copied through.  If a command argument contains an embedded
     equal sign, that argument is treated as if it had appeared
     in an ooppttiioonn statement at the beginning of the program.  _E_f_l
     is best used with _f_7_7(1).
