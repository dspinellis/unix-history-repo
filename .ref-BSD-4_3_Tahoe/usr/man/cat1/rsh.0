     _R_s_h connects to the specified _h_o_s_t, and executes the speci-
     fied _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.  _R_s_h copies its standard input to the remote
     command, the standard output of the remote command to its
     standard output, and the standard error of the remote com-
     mand to its standard error.  Interrupt, quit and terminate
     signals are propagated to the remote command; _r_s_h normally
     terminates when the remote command does.

     The remote username used is the same as your local username,
     unless you specify a different remote name with the --ll
     option.  This remote name must be equivalent (in the sense
     of _r_l_o_g_i_n(1C)) to the originating account; no provision is
     made for specifying a password with a command.

     If you omit _c_o_m_m_a_n_d, then instead of executing a single com-
     mand, you will be logged in on the remote host using
     _r_l_o_g_i_n(1C).

     Shell metacharacters which are not quoted are interpreted on
     local machine, while quoted metacharacters are interpreted
     on the remote machine.  Thus the command

	rsh otherhost cat remotefile >> localfile

     appends the remote file _r_e_m_o_t_e_f_i_l_e to the localfile _l_o_c_a_l_-
     _f_i_l_e, while

	rsh otherhost cat remotefile ">>" otherremotefile

     appends _r_e_m_o_t_e_f_i_l_e to _o_t_h_e_r_r_e_m_o_t_e_f_i_l_e.

     Host names are given in the file /etc/hosts.  Each host has
     one standard name (the first name given in the file), which
     is rather long and unambiguous, and optionally one or more
     nicknames.  The host names for local machines are also com-
     mands in the directory /usr/hosts; if you put this directory
     in your search path then the rrsshh can be omitted.

BBUUGGSS
     If you are using _c_s_h(1) and put a _r_s_h(1C) in the background
     without redirecting its input away from the terminal, it
     will block even if no reads are posted by the remote com-
     mand.  If no input is desired you should redirect the input
     of _r_s_h to /dev/null using the --nn option.

     You cannot run an interactive command (like _r_o_g_u_e(6) or
     _v_i(1)); use _r_l_o_g_i_n(1C).

     Stop signals stop the local _r_s_h process only; this is argu-
     ably wrong, but currently hard to fix for reasons too com-
     plicated to explain here.
