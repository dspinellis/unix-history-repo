     _M_o_r_e is a filter which allows examination of a continuous
     text one screenful at a time on a soft-copy terminal.  It
     normally pauses after each screenful, printing --More-- at
     the bottom of the screen.	If the user then types a carriage
     return, one more line is displayed.  If the user hits a
     space, another screenful is displayed.  Other possibilities
     are enumerated later.

     The command line options are:

     -_n   An integer which is the size (in lines) of the window
	  which _m_o_r_e will use instead of the default.

     --cc   _M_o_r_e will draw each page by beginning at the top of the
	  screen and erasing each line just before it draws on
	  it.  This avoids scrolling the screen, making it easier
	  to read while _m_o_r_e is writing.  This option will be
	  ignored if the terminal does not have the ability to
	  clear to the end of a line.

     --dd   _M_o_r_e will prompt the user with the message "Press space
	  to continue, 'q' to quit." at the end of each screen-
	  ful, and will respond to subsequent illegal user input
	  by printing "Press 'h' for instructions." instead of
	  ringing the bell.  This is useful if _m_o_r_e is being used
	  as a filter in some setting, such as a class, where
	  many users may be unsophisticated.

     --ff   This causes _m_o_r_e to count logical, rather than screen
	  lines.  That is, long lines are not folded.  This
	  option is recommended if _n_r_o_f_f output is being piped
	  through _u_l, since the latter may generate escape
	  sequences.  These escape sequences contain characters
	  which would ordinarily occupy screen positions, but
	  which do not print when they are sent to the terminal
	  as part of an escape sequence.  Thus _m_o_r_e may think
	  that lines are longer than they actually are, and fold
	  lines erroneously.

     --ll   Do not treat ^L (form feed) specially.  If this option
	  is not given, _m_o_r_e will pause after any line that con-
	  tains a ^L, as if the end of a screenful had been

	  reached.  Also, if a file begins with a form feed, the
	  screen will be cleared before the file is printed.

     --ss   Squeeze multiple blank lines from the output, producing
	  only one blank line.	Especially helpful when viewing
	  _n_r_o_f_f output, this option maximizes the useful informa-
	  tion present on the screen.

     --uu   Normally, _m_o_r_e will handle underlining such as produced
	  by _n_r_o_f_f in a manner appropriate to the particular ter-
	  minal:  if the terminal can perform underlining or has
	  a stand-out mode, _m_o_r_e will output appropriate escape
	  sequences to enable underlining or stand-out mode for
	  underlined information in the source file.  The -_u
	  option suppresses this processing.

     ++_l_i_n_e_n_u_m_b_e_r
	  Start up at _l_i_n_e_n_u_m_b_e_r.

     ++//_p_a_t_t_e_r_n
	  Start up two lines before the line containing the regu-
	  lar expression _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.

     If the program is invoked as _p_a_g_e, then the screen is
     cleared before each screenful is printed (but only if a full
     screenful is being printed), and _k - 1 rather than _k - 2
     lines are printed in each screenful, where _k is the number
     of lines the terminal can display.

     _M_o_r_e looks in the file /_e_t_c/_t_e_r_m_c_a_p to determine terminal
     characteristics, and to determine the default window size.
     On a terminal capable of displaying 24 lines, the default
     window size is 22 lines.

     _M_o_r_e looks in the environment variable _M_O_R_E to pre-set any
     flags desired.  For example, if you prefer to view files
     using the -_c mode of operation, the _c_s_h command _s_e_t_e_n_v _M_O_R_E
     -_c or the _s_h command sequence _M_O_R_E='-_c' ; _e_x_p_o_r_t _M_O_R_E would
     cause all invocations of _m_o_r_e , including invocations by
     programs such as _m_a_n and _m_s_g_s , to use this mode.	Normally,
     the user will place the command sequence which sets up the
     _M_O_R_E environment variable in the ._c_s_h_r_c or ._p_r_o_f_i_l_e file.

     If _m_o_r_e is reading from a file, rather than a pipe, then a
     percentage is displayed along with the --More-- prompt.
     This gives the fraction of the file (in characters, not
     lines) that has been read so far.

     Other sequences which may be typed when _m_o_r_e pauses, and
     their effects, are as follows (_i is an optional integer
     argument, defaulting to 1) :

     _i<space>
	  display _i more lines, (or another screenful if no argu-
	  ment is given)

     ^D   display 11 more lines (a ``scroll'').  If _i is given,
	  then the scroll size is set to _i.

     d	  same as ^D (control-D)

     _iz   same as typing a space except that _i, if present,
	  becomes the new window size.

     _is   skip _i lines and print a screenful of lines

     _if   skip _i screenfuls and print a screenful of lines

     _ib   skip back _i screenfuls and print a screenful of lines

     v	  Start up the editor _v_i at the current line.

     h	  Help command; give a description of all the _m_o_r_e com-
	  mands.

     _i/expr
	  search for the _i-th occurrence of the regular expres-
	  sion _e_x_p_r.  If there are less than _i occurrences of
	  _e_x_p_r, and the input is a file (rather than a pipe),
	  then the position in the file remains unchanged.  Oth-
	  erwise, a screenful is displayed, starting two lines
	  before the place where the expression was found.  The
	  user's erase and kill characters may be used to edit
	  the regular expression.  Erasing back past the first
	  column cancels the search command.

     _in   search for the _i-th occurrence of the last regular
	  expression entered.

     '	  (single quote) Go to the point from which the last
	  search started.  If no search has been performed in the
	  current file, this command goes back to the beginning
	  of the file.

     !command
	  invoke a shell with _c_o_m_m_a_n_d. The characters `%' and `!'
	  in "command" are replaced with the current file name

	  and the previous shell command respectively.	If there
	  is no current file name, `%' is not expanded.  The
	  sequences "\%" and "\!" are replaced by "%" and "!"
	  respectively.

     _i:n  skip to the _i-th next file given in the command line
	  (skips to last file if n doesn't make sense)

     _i:p  skip to the _i-th previous file given in the command
	  line.  If this command is given in the middle of print-
	  ing out a file, then _m_o_r_e goes back to the beginning of
	  the file. If _i doesn't make sense, _m_o_r_e skips back to
	  the first file.  If _m_o_r_e is not reading from a file,
	  the bell is rung and nothing else happens.

     :f   display the current file name and line number.

     :q or :Q
	  exit from _m_o_r_e (same as q or Q).

     .	  (dot) repeat the previous command.

     The commands take effect immediately, i.e., it is not neces-
     sary to type a carriage return.  Up to the time when the
     command character itself is given, the user may hit the line
     kill character to cancel the numerical argument being
     formed.  In addition, the user may hit the erase character
     to redisplay the --More--(xx%) message.

     At any time when output is being sent to the terminal, the
     user can hit the quit key (normally control-\).  _M_o_r_e will
     stop sending output, and will display the usual --More--
     prompt.  The user may then enter one of the above commands
     in the normal manner.  Unfortunately, some output is lost
     when this is done, due to the fact that any characters wait-
     ing in the terminal's output queue are flushed when the quit
     signal occurs.

     The terminal is set to _n_o_e_c_h_o mode by this program so that
     the output can be continuous.  What you type will thus not
     show on your terminal, except for the / and !  commands.

     If the standard output is not a teletype, then _m_o_r_e acts
     just like _c_a_t, except that a header is printed before each
     file (if there is more than one).

     A sample usage of _m_o_r_e in previewing _n_r_o_f_f output would be
