     _M_a_i_l is a intelligent mail processing system, which has a
     command syntax reminiscent of _e_d with lines replaced by mes-
     sages.

     The --vv flag puts mail into verbose mode; the details of
     delivery are displayed on the users terminal.  The --ii flag
     causes tty interrupt signals to be ignored. This is particu-
     larly useful when using _m_a_i_l on noisy phone lines.  The --nn
     flag inhibits the reading of /usr/lib/Mail.rc.

     _S_e_n_d_i_n_g _m_a_i_l.  To send a message to one or more people, _m_a_i_l
     can be invoked with arguments which are the names of people
     to whom the mail will be sent.  You are then expected to
     type in your message, followed by an EOT (control-D) at the
     beginning of a line.  A subject may be specified on the com-
     mand line by using the --ss flag. (Only the first argument
     after the --ss flag is used as a subject; be careful to quote
     subjects containing spaces.) The section below, labeled
     _R_e_p_l_y_i_n_g _t_o _o_r _o_r_i_g_i_n_a_t_i_n_g _m_a_i_l, describes some features of
     _m_a_i_l available to help you compose your letter.

     _R_e_a_d_i_n_g _m_a_i_l.  In normal usage _m_a_i_l is given no arguments
     and checks your mail out of the post office, then prints out
     a one line header of each message there.  The current mes-
     sage is initially the first message (numbered 1) and can be
     printed using the pprriinntt command (which can be abbreviated
     pp).  You can move among the messages much as you move
     between lines in _e_d, with the commands `+' and `-' moving
     backwards and forwards, and simple numbers.

     _D_i_s_p_o_s_i_n_g _o_f _m_a_i_l.  After examining a message you can ddeelleettee
     (dd) the message or rreeppllyy (rr) to it.  Deletion causes the
     _m_a_i_l program to forget about the message.	This is not
     irreversible; the message can be uunnddeelleetteedd (uu) by giving its
     number, or the _m_a_i_l session can be aborted by giving the
     eexxiitt (xx) command.	Deleted messages will, however, usually
     disappear never to be seen again.

     _S_p_e_c_i_f_y_i_n_g _m_e_s_s_a_g_e_s.  Commands such as pprriinntt and ddeelleettee can
     be given a list of message numbers as arguments to apply to
     a number of messages at once.  Thus ``delete 1 2'' deletes
     messages 1 and 2, while ``delete 1-5'' deletes messages 1
     through 5.  The special name ``*'' addresses all messages,



Printed 7/9/88		   May 9, 1986				1






MAIL(1)             UNIX Programmer's Manual		  MAIL(1)



     and ``$'' addresses the last message; thus the command ttoopp
     which prints the first few lines of a message could be used
     in ``top *'' to print the first few lines of all messages.

     _R_e_p_l_y_i_n_g _t_o _o_r _o_r_i_g_i_n_a_t_i_n_g _m_a_i_l.  You can use the rreeppllyy com-
     mand to set up a response to a message, sending it back to
     the person who it was from.  Text you then type in, up to an
     end-of-file, defines the contents of the message.	While you
     are composing a message, _m_a_i_l treats lines beginning with
     the character `~' specially.  For instance, typing ``~m''
     (alone on a line) will place a copy of the current message
     into the response right shifting it by a tabstop.	Other
     escapes will set up subject fields, add and delete reci-
     pients to the message and allow you to escape to an editor
     to revise the message or to a shell to run some commands.
     (These options are given in the summary below.)

     _E_n_d_i_n_g _a _m_a_i_l _p_r_o_c_e_s_s_i_n_g _s_e_s_s_i_o_n.	You can end a _m_a_i_l ses-
     sion with the qquuiitt (qq) command.  Messages which have been
     examined go to your _m_b_o_x file unless they have been deleted
     in which case they are discarded.	Unexamined messages go
     back to the post office.  The --ff option causes _m_a_i_l to read
     in the contents of your _m_b_o_x (or the specified file) for
     processing; when you qquuiitt, _m_a_i_l writes undeleted messages
     back to this file.  The --uu flag is a short way of doing
     "mail --ff /usr/spool/mail/user".

     _P_e_r_s_o_n_a_l _a_n_d _s_y_s_t_e_m_w_i_d_e _d_i_s_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_o_n _l_i_s_t_s.  It is also pos-
     sible to create a personal distribution lists so that, for
     instance, you can send mail to ``cohorts'' and have it go to
     a group of people.  Such lists can be defined by placing a
     line like

	  alias cohorts bill ozalp jkf mark kridle@ucbcory

     in the file .mailrc in your home directory.  The current
     list of such aliases can be displayed with the aalliiaass ((aa))
     command in _m_a_i_l.  System wide distribution lists can be
     created by editing /usr/lib/aliases, see _a_l_i_a_s_e_s(5) and
     _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l(8); these are kept in a different syntax.  In mail
     you send, personal aliases will be expanded in mail sent to
     others so that they will be able to rreeppllyy to the recipients.
     System wide _a_l_i_a_s_e_s are not expanded when the mail is sent,
     but any reply returned to the machine will have the system
     wide alias expanded as all mail goes through _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l.

     _N_e_t_w_o_r_k _m_a_i_l (_A_R_P_A, _U_U_C_P, _B_e_r_k_n_e_t)  See _m_a_i_l_a_d_d_r(_7) for a
     description of network addresses.

     _M_a_i_l has a number of options which can be set in the ._m_a_i_l_r_c
     file to alter its behavior; thus ``set askcc'' enables the
     ``askcc'' feature.  (These options are summarized below.)

MAIL(1)             UNIX Programmer's Manual		  MAIL(1)



SSUUMMMMAARRYY
     (Adapted from the `Mail Reference Manual')

     Each command is typed on a line by itself, and may take
     arguments following the command word.  The command need not
     be typed in its entirety - the first command which matches
     the typed prefix is used.	For commands which take message
     lists as arguments, if no message list is given, then the
     next message forward which satisfies the command's require-
     ments is used.  If there are no messages forward of the
     current message, the search proceeds backwards, and if there
     are no good messages at all, _m_a_i_l types ``No applicable mes-
     sages'' and aborts the command.

     --		 Goes to the previous message and prints it out.
		 If given a numeric argument _n, goes to the _n-th
		 previous message and prints it.

     ??		 Prints a brief summary of commands.

     !!		 Executes the UNIX shell command which follows.

     PPrriinntt	 (PP) Like pprriinntt but also prints out ignored
		 header fields. See also pprriinntt , iiggnnoorree and
		 rreettaaiinn..

     RReeppllyy	 (RR) Reply to originator. Does not reply to other
		 recipients of the original message.

     TTyyppee	 (TT) Identical to the PPrriinntt command.

     aalliiaass	 (aa) With no arguments, prints out all
		 currently-defined aliases.  With one argument,
		 prints out that alias.  With more than one argu-
		 ment, creates an new or changes an on old alias.

     aalltteerrnnaatteess  (aalltt) The aalltteerrnnaatteess command is useful if you
		 have accounts on several machines.  It can be
		 used to inform _m_a_i_l that the listed addresses
		 are really you. When you rreeppllyy to messages, _m_a_i_l
		 will not send a copy of the message to any of
		 the addresses listed on the _a_l_t_e_r_n_a_t_e_s list. If
		 the aalltteerrnnaatteess command is given with no argu-
		 ment, the current set of alternate names is
		 displayed.

     cchhddiirr	 (cc) Changes the user's working directory to that
		 specified, if given.  If no directory is given,
		 then changes to the user's login directory.

     ccooppyy	 (ccoo) The ccooppyy command does the same thing that
		 ssaavvee does, except that it does not mark the

MAIL(1)             UNIX Programmer's Manual		  MAIL(1)



		 messages it is used on for deletion when you
		 quit.

     ddeelleettee	 (dd) Takes a list of messages as argument and
		 marks them all as deleted.  Deleted messages
		 will not be saved in _m_b_o_x, nor will they be
		 available for most other commands.

     ddpp          (also ddtt) Deletes the current message and prints
		 the next message.  If there is no next message,
		 _m_a_i_l says ``at EOF.''

     eeddiitt	 (ee) Takes a list of messages and points the text
		 editor at each one in turn.  On return from the
		 editor, the message is read back in.

     eexxiitt	 (eexx or xx) Effects an immediate return to the
		 Shell without modifying the user's system mail-
		 box, his _m_b_o_x file, or his edit file in --ff.

     ffiillee	 (ffii) The same as ffoollddeerr.

     ffoollddeerrss	 List the names of the folders in your folder
		 directory.

     ffoollddeerr	 (ffoo) The ffoollddeerr command switches to a new mail
		 file or folder. With no arguments, it tells you
		 which file you are currently reading.	If you
		 give it an argument, it will write out changes
		 (such as deletions) you have made in the current
		 file and read in the new file. Some special con-
		 ventions are recognized for the name. # means
		 the previous file, % means your system mailbox,
		 %user means user's system mailbox, & means your
		 ~/mbox file, and +folder means a file in your
		 folder directory.

     ffrroomm	 (ff) Takes a list of messages and prints their
		 message headers.

     hheeaaddeerrss	 (hh) Lists the current range of headers, which is
		 an 18 message group.  If a ``+'' argument is
		 given, then the next 18 message group is
		 printed, and if a ``-'' argument is given, the
		 previous 18 message group is printed.

     hheellpp	 A synonym for ?

     hhoolldd	 (hhoo, also pprreesseerrvvee) Takes a message list and
		 marks each message therein to be saved in the
		 user's system mailbox instead of in _m_b_o_x.  Does
		 not override the ddeelleettee command.

     iiggnnoorree	 NN..BB..:: _I_g_n_o_r_e has been superseded by _r_e_t_a_i_n.
		 Add the list of header fields named to the
		 _i_g_n_o_r_e_d _l_i_s_t.	Header fields in the ignore list
		 are not printed on your terminal when you print
		 a message. This command is very handy for
		 suppression of certain machine-generated header
		 fields. The TTyyppee and PPrriinntt commands can be used
		 to print a message in its entirety, including
		 ignored fields. If iiggnnoorree is executed with no
		 arguments, it lists the current set of ignored
		 fields.

     mmaaiill	 (mm) Takes as argument login names and distribu-
		 tion group names and sends mail to those people.

     mmbbooxx	 Indicate that a list of messages be sent to _m_b_o_x
		 in your home directory when you quit. This is
		 the default action for messages if you do _n_o_t
		 have the _h_o_l_d option set.

     nneexxtt	 (nn like ++ or CR) Goes to the next message in
		 sequence and types it.  With an argument list,
		 types the next matching message.

     pprreesseerrvvee	 (pprree) A synonym for hhoolldd.

     pprriinntt	 (pp) Takes a message list and types out each mes-
		 sage on the user's terminal.

     qquuiitt	 (qq) Terminates the session, saving all
		 undeleted, unsaved messages in the user's _m_b_o_x
		 file in his login directory, preserving all mes-
		 sages marked with hhoolldd or pprreesseerrvvee or never
		 referenced in his system mailbox, and removing
		 all other messages from his system mailbox.  If
		 new mail has arrived during the session, the
		 message ``You have new mail'' is given.  If
		 given while editing a mailbox file with the --ff
		 flag, then the edit file is rewritten.  A return
		 to the Shell is effected, unless the rewrite of
		 edit file fails, in which case the user can
		 escape with the eexxiitt command.

     rreeppllyy	 (rr) Takes a message list and sends mail to the
		 sender and all recipients of the specified mes-
		 sage.	The default message must not be deleted.

     rreessppoonndd	 A synonym for rreeppllyy.

     rreettaaiinn	 Add the list of header fields named to the
		 _r_e_t_a_i_n_e_d _l_i_s_t.  Only the header fields in the
		 retain list are shown on your terminal when you

		 print a message.  All other header fields are
		 suppressed.  The TTyyppee and PPrriinntt commands can be
		 used to print a message in its entirety.  If
		 rreettaaiinn is executed with no arguments, it lists
		 the current set of retained fields.

     ssaavvee	 (ss) Takes a message list and a filename and
		 appends each message in turn to the end of the
		 file.	The filename in quotes, followed by the
		 line count and character count is echoed on the
		 user's terminal.

     sseett	 (ssee) With no arguments, prints all variable
		 values.  Otherwise, sets option.  Arguments are
		 of the form ``option=value'' (no space before or
		 after =) or ``option.''

     sshheellll	 (sshh) Invokes an interactive version of the
		 shell.

     ssiizzee	 Takes a message list and prints out the size in
		 characters of each message.

     ssoouurrccee	 (ssoo) The ssoouurrccee command reads _m_a_i_l commands from
		 a file.

     ttoopp	 Takes a message list and prints the top few
		 lines of each.  The number of lines printed is
		 controlled by the variable ttoopplliinneess and defaults
		 to five.

     ttyyppee	 (tt) A synonym for pprriinntt.

     uunnaalliiaass	 Takes a list of names defined by aalliiaass commands
		 and discards the remembered groups of users.
		 The group names no longer have any significance.

     uunnddeelleettee	 (uu) Takes a message list and marks each message
		 as _n_o_t being deleted.

     uunnrreeaadd	 (UU) Takes a message list and marks each message
		 as _n_o_t having been read.

     uunnsseett	 Takes a list of option names and discards their
		 remembered values; the inverse of sseett.

     vviissuuaall	 (vv) Takes a message list and invokes the display
		 editor on each message.

     wwrriittee	 (ww) Similar to ssaavvee, except that _o_n_l_y the mes-
		 sage body (_w_i_t_h_o_u_t the header) is saved.
		 Extremely useful for such tasks as sending and

     zz		 _M_a_i_l presents message headers in windowfuls as
		 described under the hheeaaddeerrss command. You can
		 move _m_a_i_l's attention forward to the next window
		 with the zz command. Also, you can move to the
		 previous window by using zz--.

     Here is a summary of the tilde escapes, which are used when
     composing messages to perform special functions.  Tilde
     escapes are only recognized at the beginning of lines.  The
     name ``tilde escape'' is somewhat of a misnomer since the
     actual escape character can be set by the option eessccaappee..

     ~~!!command	 Execute the indicated shell command, then return
		 to the message.

     ~~bb name ... Add the given names to the list of carbon copy
		 recipients but do not make the names visible in
		 the Cc: line ("blind" carbon copy).

     ~~cc name ... Add the given names to the list of carbon copy
		 recipients.

     ~~dd          Read the file ``dead.letter'' from your home
		 directory into the message.

     ~~ee          Invoke the text editor on the message collected
		 so far.  After the editing session is finished,
		 you may continue appending text to the message.

     ~~ff messages Read the named messages into the message being
		 sent.	If no messages are specified, read in the
		 current message.

     ~~hh          Edit the message header fields by typing each
		 one in turn and allowing the user to append text
		 to the end or modify the field by using the
		 current terminal erase and kill characters.

     ~~mm messages Read the named messages into the message being
		 sent, shifted right one tab.  If no messages are
		 specified, read the current message.

     ~~pp          Print out the message collected so far, prefaced
		 by the message header fields.

     ~~qq          Abort the message being sent, copying the mes-
		 sage to ``dead.letter'' in your home directory

		 if ssaavvee is set.

     ~~rr filename Read the named file into the message.

     ~~ss string	 Cause the named string to become the current
		 subject field.

     ~~tt name ... Add the given names to the direct recipient
		 list.

     ~~vv          Invoke an alternate editor (defined by the
		 VISUAL option) on the message collected so far.
		 Usually, the alternate editor will be a screen
		 editor.  After you quit the editor, you may
		 resume appending text to the end of your mes-
		 sage.

     ~~ww filename Write the message onto the named file.

     ~~||command	 Pipe the message through the command as a
		 filter.  If the command gives no output or ter-
		 minates abnormally, retain the original text of
		 the message.  The command _f_m_t(1) is often used
		 as _c_o_m_m_a_n_d to rejustify the message.

     ~~~~string	 Insert the string of text in the message pre-
		 faced by a single ~.  If you have changed the
		 escape character, then you should double that
		 character in order to send it.

     Options are controlled via the sseett and uunnsseett commands.
     Options may be either binary, in which case it is only sig-
     nificant to see whether they are set or not; or string, in
     which case the actual value is of interest.  The binary
     options include the following:

     aappppeenndd	    Causes messages saved in _m_b_o_x to be appended
		    to the end rather than prepended.  (This is
		    set in /usr/lib/Mail.rc on version 7 sys-
		    tems.)

     aasskk	    Causes _m_a_i_l to prompt you for the subject of
		    each message you send.  If you respond with
		    simply a newline, no subject field will be
		    sent.

     aasskkcccc	    Causes you to be prompted for additional car-
		    bon copy recipients at the end of each mes-
		    sage.  Responding with a newline indicates

		    thus, after deleting a message, the next one
		    will be typed automatically.

     ddeebbuugg	    Setting the binary option _d_e_b_u_g is the same
		    as specifying --dd on the command line and
		    causes _m_a_i_l to output all sorts of informa-
		    tion useful for debugging _m_a_i_l.

     ddoott	    The binary option _d_o_t causes _m_a_i_l to inter-
		    pret a period alone on a line as the termina-
		    tor of a message you are sending.

     hhoolldd	    This option is used to hold messages in the
		    system mailbox by default.

     iiggnnoorree	    Causes interrupt signals from your terminal
		    to be ignored and echoed as @'s.

     iiggnnoorreeeeooff	    An option related to _d_o_t is _i_g_n_o_r_e_e_o_f which
		    makes _m_a_i_l refuse to accept a control-d as
		    the end of a message.  _I_g_n_o_r_e_e_o_f also applies
		    to _m_a_i_l command mode.

     mmeettoooo	    Usually, when a group is expanded that con-
		    tains the sender, the sender is removed from
		    the expansion.  Setting this option causes
		    the sender to be included in the group.

     nnoossaavvee	    Normally, when you abort a message with two
		    RUBOUT, _m_a_i_l copies the partial letter to the
		    file ``dead.letter'' in your home directory.
		    Setting the binary option _n_o_s_a_v_e prevents
		    this.

     RReeppllyyaallll	    Reverses the sense of _r_e_p_l_y and _R_e_p_l_y com-
		    mands.

     qquuiieett	    Suppresses the printing of the version when
		    first invoked.

     vveerrbboossee	    Setting the option _v_e_r_b_o_s_e is the same as
		    using the --vv flag on the command line. When
		    mail runs in verbose mode, the actual
		    delivery of messages is displayed on he users
		    terminal.

     The following options have string values:

     EDITOR	    Pathname of the text editor to use in the
		    eeddiitt command and ~e escape.  If not defined,
		    then a default editor is used.

     PAGER	    Pathname of the program to use in the mmoorree
		    command or when _c_r_t variable is set.  A
		    default paginator is used if this option is
		    not defined.

     SHELL	    Pathname of the shell to use in the !! command
		    and the ~! escape.	A default shell is used
		    if this option is not defined.

     VISUAL	    Pathname of the text editor to use in the
		    vviissuuaall command and ~v escape.

     ccrrtt	    The valued option _c_r_t is used as a threshold
		    to determine how long a message must be
		    before PPAAGGEERR is used to read it.

     eessccaappee	    If defined, the first character of this
		    option gives the character to use in the
		    place of ~ to denote escapes.

     ffoollddeerr	    The name of the directory to use for storing
		    folders of messages. If this name begins with
		    a `/', _m_a_i_l considers it to be an absolute
		    pathname; otherwise, the folder directory is
		    found relative to your home directory.

     rreeccoorrdd	    If defined, gives the pathname of the file
		    used to record all outgoing mail.  If not
		    defined, then outgoing mail is not so saved.

     ttoopplliinneess	    If defined, gives the number of lines of a
		    message to be printed out with the ttoopp com-
		    mand; normally, the first five lines are
		    printed.

FFIILLEESS
     /usr/spool/mail/*	      post office
     ~/mbox		      your old mail
     ~/.mailrc		      file giving initial mail commands
