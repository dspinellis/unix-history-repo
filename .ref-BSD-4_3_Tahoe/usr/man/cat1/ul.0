     _U_l reads the named files (or standard input if none are
     given) and translates occurrences of underscores to the
     sequence which indicates underlining for the terminal in
     use, as specified by the environment variable TERM.  The --tt
     option overrides the terminal kind specified in the environ-
     ment.  The file /_e_t_c/_t_e_r_m_c_a_p is read to determine the
     appropriate sequences for underlining.  If the terminal is
     incapable of underlining, but is capable of a standout mode
     then that is used instead.  If the terminal can overstrike,
     or handles underlining automatically, _u_l degenerates to
     _c_a_t(1).  If the terminal cannot underline, underlining is
     ignored.

     The --ii option causes _u_l to indicate underlining onto by a
     separate line containing appropriate dashes `-'; this is
     useful when you want to look at the underlining which is
     present in an _n_r_o_f_f output stream on a crt-terminal.

     _N_r_o_f_f usually outputs a series of backspaces and underlines
     intermixed with the text to indicate underlining.	No
     attempt is made to optimize the backward motion.
