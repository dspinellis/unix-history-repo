     _F_r_o_m prints out the mail header lines in your mailbox file
     to show you who your mail is from.  If _u_s_e_r is specified,
     then _u_s_e_r's mailbox is examined instead of your own.  If the
     -s option is given, then only headers for mail sent by
     _s_e_n_d_e_r are printed.
