     _W_h_a_t reads each file and searches for sequences of the form
     ``@(#)'' as inserted by the source code control system.  It
     then prints the remainder of the string after this marker,
     up to a null character, newline, double quote, or ``>''
     character.

BBUUGGSS
     As SCCS is not licensed with UNIX/32V, this is a rewrite of
     the _w_h_a_t command which is part of SCCS, and may not behave
     exactly the same as that command does.
