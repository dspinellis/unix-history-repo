     fsplit - split a multi-routine Fortran file into individual
     files

     FFsspplliitt takes as input either a file or standard input con-
     taining Fortran source code.  It attempts to split the input
     into separate routine files of the form _n_a_m_e._f, where _n_a_m_e
     is the name of the program unit (e.g. function, subroutine,
     block data or program).  The name for unnamed block data
     subprograms has the form _b_l_k_d_t_a_N_N_N._f where NNN is three
     digits and a file of this name does not already exist.  For
     unnamed main programs the name has the form _m_a_i_n_N_N_N._f. If
     there is an error in classifying a program unit, or if
     _n_a_m_e._f already exists, the program unit will be put in a
     file of the form _z_z_z_N_N_N._f where _z_z_z_N_N_N._f does not already
     exist.

     Normally each subprogram unit is split into a separate file.
     When the -_e option is used, only the specified subprogram
     units are split into separate files.  E.g.:
	  fsplit -e readit -e doit prog.f
     will split readit and doit into separate files.

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
     If names specified via the -_e option are not found, a diag-
     nostic is written to _s_t_a_n_d_a_r_d _e_r_r_o_r.

BBUUGGSS
     _F_s_p_l_i_t assumes the subprogram name is on the first noncom-
     ment line of the subprogram unit.	Nonstandard source for-
     mats may confuse _f_s_p_l_i_t.

     It is hard to use -_e for unnamed main programs and block
     data subprograms since you must predict the created file
     name.
