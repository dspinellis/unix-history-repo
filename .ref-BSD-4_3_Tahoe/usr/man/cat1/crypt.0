     _C_r_y_p_t reads from the standard input and writes on the stan-
     dard output.  The _p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d is a key that selects a particu-
     lar transformation.  If no _p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d is given, _c_r_y_p_t demands
     a key from the terminal and turns off printing while the key
     is being typed in.  _C_r_y_p_t encrypts and decrypts with the
     same key:

	  crypt key <clear >cypher
	  crypt key <cypher | pr

     will print the clear.

     Files encrypted by _c_r_y_p_t are compatible with those treated
     by the editor _e_d in encryption mode.

     The security of encrypted files depends on three factors:
     the fundamental method must be hard to solve; direct search
     of the key space must be infeasible; `sneak paths' by which
     keys or cleartext can become visible must be minimized.

     _C_r_y_p_t implements a one-rotor machine designed along the
     lines of the German Enigma, but with a 256-element rotor.
     Methods of attack on such machines are known, but not
     widely; moreover the amount of work required is likely to be
     large.

     The transformation of a key into the internal settings of
     the machine is deliberately designed to be expensive, i.e.
     to take a substantial fraction of a second to compute.  How-
     ever, if keys are restricted to (say) three lower-case
     letters, then encrypted files can be read by expending only
     a substantial fraction of five minutes of machine time.

     Since the key is an argument to the _c_r_y_p_t command, it is
     potentially visible to users executing _p_s(1) or a deriva-
     tive.  To minimize this possibility, _c_r_y_p_t takes care to
     destroy any record of the key immediately upon entry.  No
     doubt the choice of keys and key security are the most
     vulnerable aspect of _c_r_y_p_t.
