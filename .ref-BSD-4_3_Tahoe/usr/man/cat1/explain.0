     _D_i_c_t_i_o_n finds all sentences in a document that contain
     phrases from a data base of bad or wordy diction.	Each
     phrase is bracketed with [ ].  Because _d_i_c_t_i_o_n runs _d_e_r_o_f_f
     before looking at the text, formatting header files should
     be included as part of the input.	The default macro package
     --mmss may be overridden with the flag --mmmm.. The flag --mmll which
     causes ddeerrooffff to skip lists, should be used if the document
     contains many lists of non-sentences.  The user may supply
     her/his own pattern file to be used in addition to the
     default file with --ff _p_f_i_l_e. If the flag --nn is also supplied
     the default file will be suppressed.

     _E_x_p_l_a_i_n is an interactive thesaurus for the phrases found by
     diction.

BBUUGGSS
     Use of non-standard formatting macros may cause incorrect
     sentence breaks.  In particular, _d_i_c_t_i_o_n doesn't grok --mmee..
