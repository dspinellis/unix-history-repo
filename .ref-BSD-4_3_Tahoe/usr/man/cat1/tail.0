     _T_a_i_l copies the named file to the standard output beginning
     at a designated place.  If no file is named, the standard
     input is used.

     Copying begins at distance +_n_u_m_b_e_r from the beginning, or
     -_n_u_m_b_e_r from the end of the input.  _N_u_m_b_e_r is counted in
     units of lines, blocks or characters, according to the
     appended option ll,, bb or cc.. When no units are specified,
     counting is by lines.

     Specifying rr causes tail to print lines from the end of the
     file in reverse order.  The default for rr is to print the
     entire file this way.  Specifying ff causes _t_a_i_l to not quit
     at end of file, but rather wait and try to read repeatedly
     in hopes that the file will grow.

BBUUGGSS
     Tails relative to the end of the file are treasured up in a
     buffer, and thus are limited in length.

     Various kinds of anomalous behavior may happen with charac-
     ter special files.
