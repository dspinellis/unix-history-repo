     _T_o_u_c_h attempts to set the modified date of each _f_i_l_e.  If a
     _f_i_l_e exists, this is done by reading a character from the
     file and writing it back.	If a _f_i_l_e does not exist, an
     attempt will be made to create it unless the --cc option is
     specified.  The --ff option will attempt to force the touch in
     spite of read and write permissions on a _f_i_l_e.
