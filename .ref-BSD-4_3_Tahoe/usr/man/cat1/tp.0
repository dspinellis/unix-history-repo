     _T_p saves and restores files on DECtape or magtape.  Its
     actions are controlled by the _k_e_y argument.  The key is a
     string of characters containing at most one function letter
     and possibly one or more function modifiers.  Other argu-
     ments to the command are file or directory names specifying
     which files are to be dumped, restored, or listed.  In all
     cases, appearance of a directory name refers to the files
     and (recursively) subdirectories of that directory.

     The function portion of the key is specified by one of the
     following letters:

     rr	     The named files are written on the tape.  If files
	     with the same names already exist, they are
	     replaced.	`Same' is determined by string com-
	     parison, so `./abc' can never be the same as
	     `/usr/dmr/abc' even if `/usr/dmr' is the current
	     directory.  If no file argument is given, `..' is the
	     default.

     uu	     updates the tape.	uu is like rr,, but a file is
	     replaced only if its modification date is later than
	     the date stored on the tape; that is to say, if it
	     has changed since it was dumped.  uu is the default
	     command if none is given.

     dd	     deletes the named files from the tape.  At least one
	     name argument must be given.  This function is not
	     permitted on magtapes.

     xx	     extracts the named files from the tape to the file
	     system.  The owner and mode are restored.	If no
	     file argument is given, the entire contents of the
	     tape are extracted.

     tt	     lists the names of the specified files.  If no file
	     argument is given, the entire contents of the tape
	     is listed.

     The following characters may be used in addition to the
     letter which selects the function desired.

     mm	       Specifies magtape as opposed to DECtape.

     00,,......,,77   This modifier selects the drive on which the tape

	       is mounted.  For DECtape, xx is default; for
	       magtape `0' is the default.

     vv	       Normally _t_p does its work silently.  The vv (ver-
	       bose) option causes it to type the name of each
	       file it treats preceded by the function letter.
	       With the tt function, vv gives more information
	       about the tape entries than just the name.

     cc	       means a fresh dump is being created; the tape
	       directory is cleared before beginning.  Usable
	       only with rr and uu.. This option is assumed with
	       magtape since it is impossible to selectively
	       overwrite magtape.

     ii	       Errors reading and writing the tape are noted, but
	       no action is taken.  Normally, errors cause a
	       return to the command level.

     ff	       Use the first named file, rather than a tape, as
	       the archive.  This option currently acts like mm;
	       _i._e. rr implies cc, and neither dd nor uu are permit-
	       ted.

     ww	       causes _t_p to pause before treating each file, type
	       the indicative letter and the file name (as with
	       vv) and await the user's response.  Response yy
	       means `yes', so the file is treated.  Null
	       response means `no', and the file does not take
	       part in whatever is being done.	Response xx means
	       `exit'; the _t_p command terminates immediately.  In
	       the xx function, files previously asked about have
	       been extracted already.	With rr,, uu,, and dd no
	       change has been made to the tape.

     Several; the non-obvious one is `Phase error', which means
     the file changed after it was selected for dumping but
     before it was dumped.

     A single file with several links to it is treated like
     several files.

     Binary-coded control information makes magnetic tapes writ-
     ten by _t_p difficult to carry to other machines; _t_a_r(1)
     avoids the problem.
