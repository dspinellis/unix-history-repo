DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     _I_n_d_e_n_t is a CC program formatter.  It reformats the CC program
     in the _i_n_p_u_t-_f_i_l_e according to the switches.  The switches
     which can be specified are described below. They may appear
     before or after the file names.

     NNOOTTEE: If you only specify an _i_n_p_u_t-_f_i_l_e, the formatting is
     done `in-place', that is, the formatted file is written back
     into _i_n_p_u_t-_f_i_l_e and a backup copy of _i_n_p_u_t-_f_i_l_e is written
     in the current directory.	If _i_n_p_u_t-_f_i_l_e is named
     `/blah/blah/file', the backup file is named file._B_A_K.

     If _o_u_t_p_u_t-_f_i_l_e is specified, _i_n_d_e_n_t checks to make sure it
     is different from _i_n_p_u_t-_f_i_l_e.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     The options listed below control the formatting style
     imposed by _i_n_d_e_n_t.

     --bbaadd,--nnbbaadd     If --bbaadd is specified, a blank line is forced
		    after every block of declarations.	Default:
		    --nnbbaadd.

     --bbaapp,--nnbbaapp     If --bbaapp is specified, a blank line is forced
		    after every procedure body.  Default: --nnbbaapp..

     --bbbbbb,--nnbbbbbb     If --bbbbbb is specified, a blank line is forced
		    before every block comment.  Default: --nnbbbbbb..

     --bbcc,--nnbbcc	    If --bbcc is specified, then a newline is forced
		    after each comma in a declaration. --nnbbcc turns
		    off this option.  The default is --nnbbcc.

     --bbrr,--bbll	    Specifying --bbll lines up compound statements
		    like this:
			if (...)
			{
			    code

			}
		    Specifying --bbrr (the default) makes them look
		    like this:
			if (...) {
			    code
			}

     --cc_n	    The column in which comments on code start.
		    The default is 33.

     --ccdd_n	    The column in which comments on declarations
		    start.  The default is for these comments to
		    start in the same column as those on code.

     --ccddbb,--nnccddbb     Enables (disables) the placement of comment
		    delimiters on blank lines.	With this option
		    enabled, comments look like this:
			 /*
			  * this is a comment
			  */
		    Rather than like this:
			 /* this is a comment */
		    This only affects block comments, not com-
		    ments to the right of code. The default is
		    --ccddbb.

     --ccee,--nnccee	    Enables (disables) forcing `else's to cuddle
		    up to the immediately preceding `}'.  The
		    default is --ccee.

     --ccii_n	    Sets the continuation indent to be _n.  Con-
		    tinuation lines will be indented that far
		    from the beginning of the first line of the
		    statement.	Parenthesized expressions have
		    extra indentation added to indicate the nest-
		    ing, unless --llpp is in effect.  --ccii defaults
		    to the same value as --ii.

     --ccllii_n	    Causes case labels to be indented _n tab stops
		    to the right of the containing sswwiittcchh state-
		    ment.  --ccllii00..55 causes case labels to be
		    indented half a tab stop.  The default is
		    --ccllii00.  (This is the only option that takes a
		    fractional argument.)

     --dd_n	    Controls the placement of comments which are
		    not to the right of code.  Specifying --dd11
		    means that such comments are placed one
		    indentation level to the left of code.  The
		    default --dd00 lines up these comments with the
		    code.  See the section on comment indentation
		    below.

     --ddii_n	    Specifies the indentation, in character posi-
		    tions, from a declaration keyword to the fol-
		    lowing identifier.	The default is --ddii1166.

     --ddjj,--nnddjj	    --ddjj left justifies declarations.  --nnddjj
		    indents declarations the same as code.  The
		    default is --nnddjj.

     --eeii,--nneeii	    Enables (disables) special eellssee--iiff process-
		    ing.  If enabled, iiffs following eellssees will
		    have the same indentation as the preceding iiff
		    statement.	The default is --eeii.

     --ffcc11,--nnffcc11     Enables (disables) the formatting of comments
		    that start in column 1.  Often, comments
		    whose leading `/' is in column 1 have been
		    carefully hand formatted by the programmer.
		    In such cases, --nnffcc11 should be used.  The
		    default is --ffcc11.

     --ii_n	    The number of spaces for one indentation
		    level.  The default is 8.

     --iipp,--nniipp	    Enables (disables) the indentation of parame-
		    ter declarations from the left margin.  The
		    default is --iipp.

     --ll_n	    Maximum length of an output line.  The
		    default is 78.

     --llpp,--nnllpp	    Lines up code surrounded by parenthesis in
		    continuation lines.  If a line has a left
		    paren which is not closed on that line, then
		    continuation lines will be lined up to start
		    at the character position just after the left
		    paren.  For example, here is how a piece of
		    continued code looks with --nnllpp in effect:
			p1 = first_procedure(second_procedure(p2, p3),
			    third_procedure(p4, p5));
		    With --llpp in effect (the default) the code
		    looks somewhat clearer:
			p1 = first_procedure(second_procedure(p2, p3),
					     third_procedure(p4, p5));
		    Inserting two more newlines we get:
			p1 = first_procedure(second_procedure(p2,
							      p3),
					     third_procedure(p4,
							     p5));

     --nnpprroo	    Causes the profile files, `./.indent.pro' and
		    `~/.indent.pro', to be ignored.

     --ppccss,--nnppccss     If true (--ppccss) all procedure calls will have
		    a space inserted between the name and the
		    `('.  The default is --nnppccss.

     --ppss,--nnppss	    If true (--ppss) the pointer following operator
		    `->' will be surrounded by spaces on either
		    side.  The default is --nnppss.

     --ppssll,--nnppssll     If true (--ppssll) the names of procedures being
		    defined are placed in column 1 - their types,
		    if any, will be left on the previous lines.
		    The default is --ppssll.

     --sscc,--nnsscc	    Enables (disables) the placement of asterisks
		    (`*'s) at the left edge of all comments.  The
		    default is --sscc.

     --ssoobb,--nnssoobb     If --ssoobb is specified, indent will swallow
		    optional blank lines.  You can use this to
		    get rid of blank lines after declarations.
		    Default: --nnssoobb.

     --sstt	    Causes iinnddeenntt to take its input from stdin,
		    and put its output to stdout.

     --TT_t_y_p_e_n_a_m_e     Adds _t_y_p_e_n_a_m_e to the list of type keywords.
		    Names accumulate: --TT can be specified more
		    than once.	You need to specify all the
		    typenames that appear in your program that
		    are defined by ttyyppeeddeeffs - nothing will be
		    harmed if you miss a few, but the program
		    won't be formatted as nicely as it should.
		    This sounds like a painful thing to have to
		    do, but it's really a symptom of a problem in
		    C: ttyyppeeddeeff causes a syntactic change in the
		    language and _i_n_d_e_n_t can't find all ttyyppeeddeeffs.

     --ttrrooffff	    Causes iinnddeenntt to format the program for pro-
		    cessing by troff.  It will produce a fancy
		    listing in much the same spirit as vvggrriinndd.
		    If the output file is not specified, the
		    default is standard output, rather than for-
		    matting in place.

     --vv,--nnvv	    --vv turns on `verbose' mode; --nnvv turns it off.
		    When in verbose mode, _i_n_d_e_n_t reports when it
		    splits one line of input into two or more
		    lines of output, and gives some size statis-
		    tics at completion. The default is --nnvv.

     You may set up your own `profile' of defaults to _i_n_d_e_n_t by
     creating a file called .._i_n_d_e_n_t.._p_r_o in either your login
     directory and/or the current directory and including what-
     ever switches you like.  Switches in `.indent.pro' in the
     current directory override those in your login directory
     (with the exception of --TT type definitions, which just accu-
     mulate).  If _i_n_d_e_n_t is run and a profile file exists, then
     it is read to set up the program's defaults.  The switches
     should be separated by spaces, tabs or newlines.  Switches
     on the command line, however, override profile switches.

     CCoommmmeennttss

     `_B_o_x' _c_o_m_m_e_n_t_s.  _I_n_d_e_n_t assumes that any comment with a dash
     or star immediately after the start of comment (that is,
     `/*-' or `/**') is a comment surrounded by a box of stars.
     Each line of such a comment is left unchanged, except that
     its indentation may be adjusted to account for the change in
     indentation of the first line of the comment.

     _S_t_r_a_i_g_h_t _t_e_x_t.  All other comments are treated as straight
     text.  _I_n_d_e_n_t fits as many words (separated by blanks, tabs,
     or newlines) on a line as possible.  Blank lines break para-
     graphs.

     CCoommmmeenntt iinnddeennttaattiioonn

     If a comment is on a line with code it is started in the
     `comment column', which is set by the --cc_n command line
     parameter.  Otherwise, the comment is started at _n indenta-
     tion levels less than where code is currently being placed,
     where _n is specified by the --dd_n command line parameter.  If
     the code on a line extends past the comment column, the com-
     ment starts further to the right, and the right margin may
     be automatically extended in extreme cases.

     In general, _i_n_d_e_n_t leaves preprocessor lines alone.  The
     only reformatting that it will do is to straighten up trail-
     ing comments.  It leaves embedded comments alone.	Condi-
     tional compilation (##iiffddeeff......##eennddiiff) is recognized and
     _i_n_d_e_n_t attempts to correctly compensate for the syntactic
     peculiarities introduced.

     _I_n_d_e_n_t understands a substantial amount about the syntax of
     C, but it has a `forgiving' parser.  It attempts to cope
     with the usual sorts of incomplete and misformed syntax.  In
     particular, the use of macros like:
	     #define forever for(;;)

     _I_n_d_e_n_t has even more switches than _l_s.

     A common mistake that often causes grief is typing:

     to the shell in an attempt to indent all the CC programs in a
     directory.  This is probably a bug, not a feature.
