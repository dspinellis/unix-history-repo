     This section briefly describes the networking facilities
     available in the system.  Documentation in this part of sec-
     tion 4 is broken up into three areas: _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l _f_a_m_i_l_i_e_s
     (domains), _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l_s, and _n_e_t_w_o_r_k _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e_s.  Entries
     describing a protocol family are marked ``4F,'' while
     entries describing protocol use are marked ``4P.'' Hardware
     support for network interfaces are found among the standard
     ``4'' entries.

     All network protocols are associated with a specific _p_r_o_t_o_-
     _c_o_l _f_a_m_i_l_y.  A protocol family provides basic services to
     the protocol implementation to allow it to function within a
     specific network environment.  These services may include
     packet fragmentation and reassembly, routing, addressing,
     and basic transport.  A protocol family may support multiple
     methods of addressing, though the current protocol implemen-
     tations do not.  A protocol family is normally comprised of
     a number of protocols, one per _s_o_c_k_e_t(2) type.  It is not
     required that a protocol family support all socket types.	A
     protocol family may contain multiple protocols supporting
     the same socket abstraction.

     A protocol supports one of the socket abstractions detailed
     in _s_o_c_k_e_t(2).  A specific protocol may be accessed either by
     creating a socket of the appropriate type and protocol fam-
     ily, or by requesting the protocol explicitly when creating
     a socket.	Protocols normally accept only one type of
     address format, usually determined by the addressing struc-
     ture inherent in the design of the protocol family/network
     architecture.  Certain semantics of the basic socket
     abstractions are protocol specific.  All protocols are
     expected to support the basic model for their particular
     socket type, but may, in addition, provide non-standard
     facilities or extensions to a mechanism.  For example, a
     protocol supporting the SOCK_STREAM abstraction may allow
     more than one byte of out-of-band data to be transmitted per
     out-of-band message.

     A network interface is similar to a device interface.  Net-
     work interfaces comprise the lowest layer of the networking
     subsystem, interacting with the actual transport hardware.
     An interface may support one or more protocol families
     and/or address formats.  The SYNOPSIS section of each

     network interface entry gives a sample specification of the
     related drivers for use in providing a system description to
     the _c_o_n_f_i_g(8) program.  The DIAGNOSTICS section lists mes-
     sages which may appear on the console and/or in the system
     error log, /_u_s_r/_a_d_m/_m_e_s_s_a_g_e_s (see _s_y_s_l_o_g_d(8)), due to errors
     in device operation.

     The system currently supports the DARPA Internet protocols
     and the Xerox Network Systems(tm) protocols.  Raw socket
     interfaces are provided to the IP protocol layer of the
     DARPA Internet, to the IMP link layer (1822), and to the IDP
     protocol of Xerox NS.  Consult the appropriate manual pages
     in this section for more information regarding the support
     for each protocol family.

AADDDDRREESSSSIINNGG
     Associated with each protocol family is an address format.
     The following address formats are used by the system (and
     additional formats are defined for possible future implemen-
     tation):

     #define AF_UNIX	       1      /* local to host (pipes, portals) */
     #define AF_INET	       2      /* internetwork: UDP, TCP, etc. */
     #define AF_IMPLINK        3      /* arpanet imp addresses */
     #define AF_PUP	       4      /* pup protocols: e.g. BSP */
     #define AF_NS	       6      /* Xerox NS protocols */
     #define AF_HYLINK	       15     /* NSC Hyperchannel */

RROOUUTTIINNGG
     The network facilities provided limited packet routing.  A
     simple set of data structures comprise a ``routing table''
     used in selecting the appropriate network interface when
     transmitting packets.  This table contains a single entry
     for each route to a specific network or host.  A user pro-
     cess, the routing daemon, maintains this data base with the
     aid of two socket-specific _i_o_c_t_l(2) commands, SIOCADDRT and
     SIOCDELRT.  The commands allow the addition and deletion of
     a single routing table entry, respectively.  Routing table
     manipulations may only be carried out by super-user.

     A routing table entry has the following form, as defined in
     <_n_e_t/_r_o_u_t_e._h>;

     struct rtentry {
	    u_long    rt_hash;
	    struct    sockaddr rt_dst;
	    struct    sockaddr rt_gateway;
	    short     rt_flags;
	    short     rt_refcnt;
	    u_long    rt_use;
	    struct    ifnet *rt_ifp;

     };

     with _r_t__f_l_a_g_s defined from,

     #define RTF_UP	       0x1    /* route usable */
     #define RTF_GATEWAY       0x2    /* destination is a gateway */
     #define RTF_HOST	       0x4    /* host entry (net otherwise) */
     #define RTF_DYNAMIC       0x10   /* created dynamically (by redirect) */

     Routing table entries come in three flavors: for a specific
     host, for all hosts on a specific network, for any destina-
     tion not matched by entries of the first two types (a wild-
     card route). When the system is booted and addresses are
     assigned to the network interfaces, each protocol family
     installs a routing table entry for each interface when it is
     ready for traffic.  Normally the protocol specifies the
     route through each interface as a ``direct'' connection to
     the destination host or network.  If the route is direct,
     the transport layer of a protocol family usually requests
     the packet be sent to the same host specified in the packet.
     Otherwise, the interface is requested to address the packet
     to the gateway listed in the routing entry (i.e. the packet
     is forwarded).

     Routing table entries installed by a user process may not
     specify the hash, reference count, use, or interface fields;
     these are filled in by the routing routines.  If a route is
     in use when it is deleted (_r_t__r_e_f_c_n_t is non-zero), the rout-
     ing entry will be marked down and removed from the routing
     table, but the resources associated with it will not be
     reclaimed until all references to it are released. The rout-
     ing code returns EEXIST if requested to duplicate an exist-
     ing entry, ESRCH if requested to delete a non-existent
     entry, or ENOBUFS if insufficient resources were available
     to install a new route.  User processes read the routing
     tables through the /_d_e_v/_k_m_e_m device.  The _r_t__u_s_e field con-
     tains the number of packets sent along the route.

     When routing a packet, the kernel will first attempt to find
     a route to the destination host.  Failing that, a search is
     made for a route to the network of the destination.
     Finally, any route to a default (``wildcard'') gateway is
     chosen.  If multiple routes are present in the table, the
     first route found will be used.  If no entry is found, the
     destination is declared to be unreachable.

     A wildcard routing entry is specified with a zero destina-
     tion address value.  Wildcard routes are used only when the
     system fails to find a route to the destination host and
     network.  The combination of wildcard routes and routing
     redirects can provide an economical mechanism for routing
     traffic.

     Each network interface in a system corresponds to a path
     through which messages may be sent and received.  A network
     interface usually has a hardware device associated with it,
     though certain interfaces such as the loopback interface,
     _l_o(4), do not.

     The following _i_o_c_t_l calls may be used to manipulate network
     interfaces.  The _i_o_c_t_l is made on a socket (typically of
     type SOCK_DGRAM) in the desired domain.  Unless specified
     otherwise, the request takes an _i_f_r_e_q_u_e_s_t structure as its
     parameter.  This structure has the form

     struct    ifreq {
     #define   IFNAMSIZ  16
	  char ifr_name[IFNAMSIZE];	     /* if name, e.g. "en0" */
	  union {
	       struct	 sockaddr ifru_addr;
	       struct	 sockaddr ifru_dstaddr;
	       struct	 sockaddr ifru_broadaddr;
	       short	 ifru_flags;
	       int  ifru_metric;
	       caddr_t	 ifru_data;
	  } ifr_ifru;
     #define   ifr_addr  ifr_ifru.ifru_addr  /* address */
     #define   ifr_dstaddr    ifr_ifru.ifru_dstaddr    /* other end of p-to-p link */
     #define   ifr_broadaddr  ifr_ifru.ifru_broadaddr  /* broadcast address */
     #define   ifr_flags ifr_ifru.ifru_flags /* flags */
     #define   ifr_metric     ifr_ifru.ifru_metric     /* metric */
     #define   ifr_data  ifr_ifru.ifru_data  /* for use by interface */
     };

     SIOCSIFADDR
	  Set interface address for protocol family.  Following
	  the address assignment, the ``initialization'' routine
	  for the interface is called.

     SIOCGIFADDR
	  Get interface address for protocol family.

     SIOCSIFDSTADDR
	  Set point to point address for protocol family and
	  interface.

     SIOCGIFDSTADDR
	  Get point to point address for protocol family and
	  interface.

     SIOCSIFBRDADDR
	  Set broadcast address for protocol family and inter-
	  face.

     SIOCGIFBRDADDR
	  Get broadcast address for protocol family and inter-
	  face.

     SIOCSIFFLAGS
	  Set interface flags field.  If the interface is marked
	  down, any processes currently routing packets through
	  the interface are notified; some interfaces may be
	  reset so that incoming packets are no longer received.
	  When marked up again, the interface is reinitialized.

     SIOCGIFFLAGS
	  Get interface flags.

     SIOCSIFMETRIC
	  Set interface routing metric.  The metric is used only
	  by user-level routers.

     SIOCGIFMETRIC
	  Get interface metric.

     SIOCGIFCONF
	  Get interface configuration list.  This request takes
	  an _i_f_c_o_n_f structure (see below) as a value-result
	  parameter.  The _i_f_c__l_e_n field should be initially set
	  to the size of the buffer pointed to by _i_f_c__b_u_f.  On
	  return it will contain the length, in bytes, of the
	  configuration list.

     /*
      * Structure used in SIOCGIFCONF request.
      * Used to retrieve interface configuration
      * for machine (useful for programs which
      * must know all networks accessible).

     struct    ifconf {
	  int  ifc_len;       /* size of associated buffer */
	  union {
	       caddr_t	 ifcu_buf;
	       struct	 ifreq *ifcu_req;
	  } ifc_ifcu;
