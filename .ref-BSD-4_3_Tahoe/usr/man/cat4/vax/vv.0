     The _v_v interface provides access to a 10 Mb/s Proteon proNET
     ring network.

     The network address of the interface must be specified with
     an an SIOCSIFADDR ioctl before data can be transmitted or
     received.	It is only permissible to change the network
     address while the interface is marked "down".

     The host's hardware address is discovered by putting the
     interface in digital loopback mode (not joining the ring)
     and sending a broadcast packet from which the hardware
     address is extracted.

     Transmit timeouts are detected through use of a watchdog
     routine.  Lost input interrupts are checked for when packets
     are sent out.

     If the installation is running CTL boards which use the old
     broadcast address of 0 instead of the new address of 0xff,
     the define OLD_BROADCAST should be specified in the driver.

     The driver can use ``trailer'' encapsulation to minimize
     copying data on input and output.	This may be disabled, on
     a per-interface basis, by setting the IFF_NOTRAILERS flag
     with an SIOCSIFFLAGS ioctl.

     The encapsulation of trailer packets in the 4.2BSD version
     of this driver was incorrect (the packet type was in VAX
     byte order).  As a result, the trailer encapsulation in this
     version is not compatible with the 4.2BSD VAX version.
