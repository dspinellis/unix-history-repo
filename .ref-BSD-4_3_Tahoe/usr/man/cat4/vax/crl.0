     crl - VAX 8600 console RL02 interface

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     This is a simple interface to the DEC RL02 disk unit which
     is part of the console subsystem on the VAX 8600 and 8650.
     Access is given to the entire RL02 disk; the pack format is
     the same as that of RL02 disks on other controllers.  As on
     other VAX console media, transfers are done a word at a time
     using privileged registers (i.e., slowly).

     All I/O is raw; the seek addresses in raw transfers should
     be a multiple of 512 bytes and a multiple of 512 bytes
     should be transferred, as in other ``raw'' disk interfaces.
     (Although the sector size is actually 256 bytes, the driver
     allows operations only on 512-byte boundaries.)
