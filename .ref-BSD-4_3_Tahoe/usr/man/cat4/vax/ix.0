     The _i_x interface provides access to a 10 Mb/s Ethernet net-
     work through an Interlan Np100 controller used as a link-
     layer interface.

     This interface is unusual in that it requires loading
     firmware into the controller before it may be used as a net-
     work interface.  This is accomplished by opening a character
     special device, and writing data to it.  A program to load
     the image is provided in /usr/src/new/np100.  The sequence
     of commands would be:

	  # ./npload np.image [/dev/np<board #> if other than np00]
	  # sleep 10
	  # ifconfig ix0 ...

     Each of the host's network addresses is specified at boot
     time with an SIOCSIFADDR ioctl.  The _i_x interface employs
     the address resolution protocol described in _a_r_p(4P) to
     dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on
     the local network.

     The interface normally tries to use a ``trailer'' encapsula-
     tion to minimize copying data on input and output.  The use
     of trailers is negotiated with ARP.  This negotiation may be
     disabled, on a per-interface basis, by setting the
     IFF_NOTRAILERS flag with an SIOCSIFFLAGS ioctl.

     firmware in the controller refused to honor a request from
     in initializing packet level communications.  The board may
     need to be reset and reloaded.  Or, you may not have allowed
     enough time between loading the board and issuing the
     request to begin unix network operation.

     sick after attempting to reprogram its physical ethernet
     address.  Try reloading the firmware.  The attempt is made
     only when this interfaces is not the first one configured
     for XNS.

     with addresses formatted in an unsuitable address family;
     the packet was dropped.

     _i_f_c_o_n_f_i_g(8c) request is made at an inopportune time, such as
     not allowing enough time after loading the firmware.  After
     100 such errors are logged, the unix network driver will
     shut itself down, saying:

     iixxrriinntt:: sshhuuttttiinngg ddoowwnn uunniixx ddllaa.  The recourse is to reload
     the firmware and allow more time.
