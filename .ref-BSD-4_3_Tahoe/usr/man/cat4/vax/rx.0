     The _r_x device provides access to a DEC RX02 floppy disk unit
     with M8256 interface module (RX211 configuration). The RX02
     uses 8-inch, single-sided, soft-sectored floppy disks (with
     pre-formatted industry-standard headers) in either single or
     double density.

     Floppy disks handled by the RX02 contain 77 tracks, each
     with 26 sectors (for a total of 2,002 sectors).  The sector
     size is 128 bytes for single density, 256 bytes for double
     density.  Single density disks are compatible with the RX01
     floppy disk unit and with IBM 3740 Series Diskette 1 sys-
     tems.

     In addition to normal (`block' and `raw') i/o, the driver
     supports formatting of disks for either density and the
     ability to invoke a 2 for 1 interleaved sector mapping com-
     patible with the DEC operating system RT-11.

     The minor device number is interpreted as follows:

     BBiitt      DDeessccrriippttiioonn
     0	      Sector interleaving  (1 disables interleaving)
     1	      Logical sector 1 is on track 1 (0 no, 1 yes)
     2	      Not used, reserved
     Other    Drive number

     The two drives in a single RX02 unit are treated as two
     disks attached to a single controller.  Thus, if there are
     two RX02's on a system, the drives on the first RX02 are
     ``rx0'' and ``rx1'', while the drives on the second are
     ``rx2'' and ``rx3''.

     When the device is opened, the density of the disk currently
     in the drive is automatically determined. If there is no
     floppy in the device, open will fail.

     The interleaving parameters are represented in raw device
     names by the letters `a' through `d'.  Thus, unit 0, drive 0
     is called by one of the following names:

     interleaved   /dev/rrx0c	 1
     direct	   /dev/rrx0d	 1

     The mapping used on the `c' device is compatible with the
     DEC operating system RT-11.  The `b' device accesses the
     sectors of the disk in strictly sequential order. The `a'
     device is the most efficient for disk-to-disk copying.  This
     mapping is always used by the block device.

     I/O requests must start on a sector boundary, involve an
     integral number of complete sectors, and not go off the end
     of the disk.

NNOOTTEESS
     Even though the storage capacity on a floppy disk is quite
     small, it is possible to make filesystems on double density
     disks. For example, the command
	  % mkfs /dev/rx0 1001 13 1 4096 512 32 0 4
     makes a file system on the double density disk in rx0 with
     436 kbytes available for file storage.  Using _t_a_r(1) gives a
     more efficient utilization of the available space for file
     storage.  Single density diskettes do not provide sufficient
     storage capacity to hold file systems.

     A number of _i_o_c_t_l(2) calls apply to the rx devices, and have
     the form
	  ##iinncclluuddee <<vvaaxxuubbaa//rrxxrreegg..hh>>
	  iiooccttll((ffiillddeess,, ccooddee,, aarrgg))
	  iinntt **aarrgg;;
     The applicable codes are:

     RXIOC_FORMAT      Format the diskette. The density to use is
		       specified by the _a_r_g argument, zero gives
		       single density while non-zero gives double
		       density.

     RXIOC_GETDENS     Return the density of the diskette (zero
		       or non-zero as above).

     RXIOC_WDDMK       On the next write, include a _d_e_l_e_t_e_d _d_a_t_a
		       _a_d_d_r_e_s_s _m_a_r_k in the header of the first
		       sector.

     RXIOC_RDDMK       Return non-zero if the last sector read
		       contained a _d_e_l_e_t_e_d _d_a_t_a _a_d_d_r_e_s_s _m_a_r_k in
		       its header, otherwise return 0.

EERRRROORRSS
     The following errors may be returned by the driver:

     [ENODEV]	 Drive not ready; usually because no disk is in
		 the drive or the drive door is open.

RX(4)		    UNIX Programmer's Manual		    RX(4)



     [ENXIO]	 Nonexistent drive (on open); offset is too large
		 or not on a sector boundary or byte count is not
		 a multiple of the sector size (on read or
		 write); or bad (undefined) ioctl code.

     [EIO]	 A physical error other than ``not ready'', prob-
		 ably bad media or unknown format.

     [EBUSY]	 Drive has been opened for exclusive access.

     [EBADF]	 No write access (on format), or wrong density;
		 the latter can only happen if the disk is
		 changed without _c_l_o_s_i_n_g the device (i.e., cal-
		 ling _c_l_o_s_e(2) ).

BBUUGGSS
     A floppy may not be formatted if the header info on sector
     1, track 0 has been damaged.  Hence, it is not possible to
     format completely degaussed disks or disks with other for-
     mats than the two known by the hardware.

     If the drive subsystem is powered down when the machine is
     booted, the controller won't interrupt.
