     The tm78/tu-78 combination provides a standard tape drive
     interface as described in _m_t_i_o(4).  Only 1600 and 6250 bpi
     are supported; the TU-78 runs at 125 ips and autoloads
     tapes.

     mmuu%%dd:: nnoo wwrriittee rriinngg.  An attempt was made to write on the
     tape drive when no write ring was present; this message is
     written on the terminal of the user who tried to access the
     tape.

     mmuu%%dd:: nnoott oonnlliinnee.	An attempt was made to access the tape
     while it was offline; this message is written on the termi-
     nal of the user who tried to access the tape.

     mmuu%%dd:: ccaann''tt cchhaannggee ddeennssiittyy iinn mmiidd--ttaappee.  An attempt was made
     to write on a tape at a different density than is already
     recorded on the tape.  This message is written on the termi-
     nal of the user who tried to switch the density.

     mmuu%%dd:: hhaarrdd eerrrroorr bbnn%%dd mmbbssrr==%%bb eerr==%%xx ddss==%%bb.   A tape error
     occurred at block _b_n; the mt error register and drive status
     register are printed in octal with the bits symbolically
     decoded.  Any error is fatal on non-raw tape; when possible
     the driver will have retried the operation which failed
     several times before reporting the error.

     mmuu%%dd:: bbllaannkk ttaappee.	An attempt was made to read a blank tape
     (a tape without even end-of-file marks).

     mmuu%%dd:: oofffflliinnee.  During an i/o operation the device was set
     offline.  If a non-raw tape was used in the access it is
     closed.

BBUUGGSS
     If any non-data error is encountered on non-raw tape, it
     refuses to do anything more until closed.

     Because 800 bpi tapes are not supported, the numbering of
     minor devices is inconsistent with triple-density tape
     units.  Unit 0 is drive 0, 1600 bpi.
