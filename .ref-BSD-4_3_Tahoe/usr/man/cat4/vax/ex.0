     The _e_x interface provides access to a 10 Mb/s Ethernet net-
     work through an Excelan controller used as a link-layer
     interface.

     Each of the host's network addresses is specified at boot
     time with an SIOCSIFADDR ioctl.  The _e_x interface employs
     the address resolution protocol described in _a_r_p(4P) to
     dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on
     the local network.

     The interface normally tries to use a ``trailer'' encapsula-
     tion to minimize copying data on input and output.  The use
     of trailers is negotiated with ARP.  This negotiation may be
     disabled, on a per-interface basis, by setting the
     IFF_NOTRAILERS flag with an SIOCSIFFLAGS ioctl.
