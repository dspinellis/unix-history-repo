     _W_a_i_t causes its caller to be suspended until a signal is
     received or one of its child processes terminates.  If any
     child has terminated since the last _w_a_i_t, return is immedi-
     ate; if there are no children, return is immediate with an
     error code.

     If the returned value is positive, it is the process ID of
     the child and _s_t_a_t_u_s is its termination status (see
     _w_a_i_t(2)).	If the returned value is negative, it is the
     negation of a system error code.
