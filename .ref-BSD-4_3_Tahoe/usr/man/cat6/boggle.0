     This program is intended for people wishing to sharpen their
     skills at Boggle (TM Parker Bros.).  If you invoke the pro-
     gram with 4 arguments of 4 letters each, (_e._g.  " .}S 3 1 ""
     " "boggle" "appl" "epie" "moth" "erhd"" the program forms
     the obvious Boggle grid and lists all the words from
     //uussrr//ddiicctt//wwoorrddss found therein. If you invoke the program
     without arguments, it will generate a board for you, let you
     enter words for 3 minutes, and then tell you how well you
     did relative to //uussrr//ddiicctt//wwoorrddss.

     The object of Boggle is to find, within 3 minutes, as many
     words as possible in a 4 by 4 grid of letters. Words may be
     formed from any sequence of 3 or more adjacent letters in
     the grid. The letters may join horizontally, vertically, or
     diagonally.  However, no position in the grid may be used
     more than once within any one word. In competitive play
     amongst humans, each player is given credit for those of his
     words which no other player has found.

     In interactive play, enter your words separated by spaces,
     tabs, or newlines. A bell will ring when there is 2:00,
     1:00, 0:10, 0:02, 0:01, and 0:00 time left. You may complete
     any word started before the expiration of time. You can
     surrender before time is up by hitting 'break'. While enter-
     ing words, your erase character is only effective within the
     current word and your line kill character is ignored.

     Advanced players may wish to invoke the program with 1 or 2
     +'s as the first argument. The first + removes the restric-
     tion that positions can only be used once in each word. The
     second + causes a position to be considered adjacent to
     itself as well as its (up to) 8 neighbors.
