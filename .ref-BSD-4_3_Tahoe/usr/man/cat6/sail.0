     _S_a_i_l is a computer version of Avalon Hill's game of fighting
     sail originally developed by S. Craig Taylor.

     Players of _S_a_i_l take command of an old fashioned Man of War
     and fight other players or the computer.  They may re-enact
     one of the many historical sea battles recorded in the game,
     or they can choose a fictional battle.

     As a sea captain in the _S_a_i_l Navy, the player has complete
     control over the workings of his ship.  He must order every
     maneuver, change the set of his sails, and judge the right
     moment to let loose the terrible destruction of his broad-
     sides.  In addition to fighting the enemy, he must harness
     the powers of the wind and sea to make them work for him.
     The outcome of many battles during the age of sail was
     decided by the ability of one captain to hold the `weather
     gage.'

     The flags are:

     --ss   Print the names and ships of the top ten sailors.

     --ll   Show the login name.	Only effective with --ss.

     --xx   Play the first available ship instead of prompting for
	  a choice.

     --bb   No bells.

     _S_a_i_l is really two programs in one.  Each player starts up a
     process which runs his own ship.  In addition, a _d_r_i_v_e_r pro-
     cess is forked (by the first player) to run the computer
     ships and take care of global bookkeeping.

     Because the _d_r_i_v_e_r must calculate moves for each ship it
     controls, the more ships the computer is playing, the slower
     the game will appear.

     If a player joins a game in progress, he will synchronize
     with the other players (a rather slow process for everyone),
     and then he may play along with the rest.

     To implement a multi-user game in Version 7 UNIX, which was
     the operating system _S_a_i_l was first written under, the

     communicating processes must use a common temporary file as
     a place to read and write messages.  In addition, a locking
     mechanism must be provided to ensure exclusive access to the
     shared file.  For example, _S_a_i_l uses a temporary file named
     /tmp/#sailsink.21 for scenario 21, and corresponding file
     names for the other scenarios.  To provide exclusive access
     to the temporary file, _S_a_i_l uses a technique stolen from an
     old game called "pubcaves" by Jeff Cohen.	Processes do a
     busy wait in the loop

	  for (n = 0; link(sync_file, sync_lock) < 0 && n < 30; n++)
				   sleep(2);

     until they are able to create a link to a file named
     "/tmp/#saillock.??".  The "??" correspond to the scenario
     number of the game.  Since UNIX guarantees that a link will
     point to only one file, the process that succeeds in linking
     will have exclusive access to the temporary file.

     Whether or not this really works is open to speculation.
     When ucbmiro was rebooted after a crash, the file system
     check program found 3 links between the _S_a_i_l temporary file
     and its link file.

     When players do something of global interest, such as moving
     or firing, the driver must coordinate the action with the
     other ships in the game.  For example, if a player wants to
     move in a certain direction, he writes a message into the
     temporary file requesting the driver to move his ship.  Each
     ``turn,'' the driver reads all the messages sent from the
     players and decides what happened.  It then writes back into
     the temporary file new values of variables, etc.

     The most noticeable effect this communication has on the
     game is the delay in moving.  Suppose a player types a move
     for his ship and hits return.  What happens then?	The
     player process saves up messages to be written to the tem-
     porary file in a buffer.  Every 7 seconds or so, the player
     process gets exclusive access to the temporary file and
     writes out its buffer to the file.  The driver, running
     asynchronously, must read in the movement command, process
     it, and write out the results.  This takes two exclusive
     accesses to the temporary file.  Finally, when the player
     process gets around to doing another 7 second update, the
     results of the move are displayed on the screen.  Hence,
     every movement requires four exclusive accesses to the tem-
     porary file (anywhere from 7 to 21 seconds depending upon
     asynchrony) before the player sees the results of his moves.

     In practice, the delays are not as annoying as they would
     appear.  There is room for "pipelining" in the movement.

SAIL(6)             UNIX Programmer's Manual		  SAIL(6)



     After the player writes out a first movement message, a
     second movement command can then be issued.  The first mes-
     sage will be in the temporary file waiting for the driver,
     and the second will be in the file buffer waiting to be
     written to the file.  Thus, by always typing moves a turn
     ahead of the time, the player can sail around quite quickly.

     If the player types several movement commands between two 7
     second updates, only the last movement command typed will be
     seen by the driver.  Movement commands within the same
     update "overwrite" each other, in a sense.

     I wrote the first version of _S_a_i_l on a PDP 11/70 in the fall
     of 1980.  Needless to say, the code was horrendous, not
     portable in any sense of the word, and didn't work.  The
     program was not very modular and had fseeks() and fwrites()
     every few lines.  After a tremendous rewrite from the top
     down, I got the first working version up by 1981.	There
     were several annoying bugs concerning firing broadsides and
     finding angles.  _S_a_i_l uses no floating point, by the way, so
     the direction routines are rather tricky.	Ed Wang rewrote
     my angle() routine in 1981 to be more correct (although it
     still doesn't work perfectly), and he added code to let a
     player select which ship he wanted at the start of the game
     (instead of the first one available).

     Captain Happy (Craig Leres) is responsible for making _S_a_i_l
     portable for the first time.  This was no easy task, by the
     way.  Constants like 2 and 10 were very frequent in the
     code.  I also became famous for using "Riggle Memorial
     Structures" in _S_a_i_l. Many of my structure references are so
     long that they run off the line printer page.  Here is an
     example, if you promise not to laugh.

     specs[scene[flog.fgamenum].ship[flog.fshipnum].shipnum].pts


     _S_a_i_l received its fourth and most thorough rewrite in the
     summer and fall of 1983.  Ed Wang rewrote and modularized
     the code (a monumental feat) almost from scratch.	Although
     he introduced many new bugs, the final result was very much
     cleaner and (?) faster.  He added window movement commands
     and find ship commands.

     Old Square Riggers were very maneuverable ships capable of
     intricate sailing.  Their only disadvantage was an inability
     to sail very close to the wind.  The design of a wooden ship
     allowed only for the guns to bear to the left and right
     sides.  A few guns of small aspect (usually 6 or 9 pounders)
     could point forward, but their effect was small compared to

     a 68 gun broadside of 24 or 32 pounders.  The guns bear
     approximately like so:

	 ---0
	     \
	      \
	       \     up to a range of ten (for round shot)
		\
		 \
		  \

     An interesting phenomenon occurred when a broadside was
     fired down the length of an enemy ship.  The shot tended to
     bounce along the deck and did several times more damage.
     This phenomenon was called a rake.  Because the bows of a
     ship are very strong and present a smaller target than the
     stern, a stern rake (firing from the stern to the bow)
     causes more damage than a bow rake.

     Most ships were equipped with carronades, which were very
     large, close range cannons.  American ships from the revolu-
     tion until the War of 1812 were almost entirely armed with
     carronades.

     The period of history covered in _S_a_i_l is approximately from
     the 1770's until the end of Napoleanic France in 1815.
     There are many excellent books about the age of sail.  My
     favorite author is Captain Frederick Marryat.  More contem-
     porary authors include C.S. Forester and Alexander Kent.

     Fighting ships came in several sizes classed by armament.
     The mainstays of any fleet were its "Ships of the Line", or
     "Line of Battle Ships".  They were so named because these
     ships fought together in great lines.  They were close
     enough for mutual support, yet every ship could fire both
     its broadsides.  We get the modern words "ocean liner," or
     "liner," and "battleship" from "ship of the line."  The most
     common size was the the 74 gun two decked ship of the line.
     The two gun decks usually mounted 18 and 24 pounder guns.

     The pride of the fleet were the first rates.  These were
     huge three decked ships of the line mounting 80 to 136 guns.
     The guns in the three tiers were usually 18, 24, and 32
     pounders in that order from top to bottom.

SAIL(6)             UNIX Programmer's Manual		  SAIL(6)



     Various other ships came next.  They were almost all
     "razees," or ships of the line with one deck sawed off.
     They mounted 40-64 guns and were a poor cross between a fri-
     gate and a line of battle ship.  They neither had the speed
     of the former nor the firepower of the latter.

     Next came the "eyes of the fleet."  Frigates came in many
     sizes mounting anywhere from 32 to 44 guns.  They were very
     handy vessels.  They could outsail anything bigger and
     outshoot anything smaller.  Frigates didn't fight in lines
     of battle as the much bigger 74's did.  Instead, they
     harassed the enemy's rear or captured crippled ships.  They
     were much more useful in missions away from the fleet, such
     as cutting out expeditions or boat actions.  They could hit
     hard and get away fast.

     Lastly, there were the corvettes, sloops, and brigs.  These
     were smaller ships mounting typically fewer than 20 guns.	A
     corvette was only slightly smaller than a frigate, so one
     might have up to 30 guns.	Sloops were used for carrying
     dispatches or passengers.	Brigs were something you built
     for land-locked lakes.

SSAAIILL PPAARRTTIICCUULLAARRSS
     Ships in _S_a_i_l are represented by two characters.  One char-
     acter represents the bow of the ship, and the other
     represents the stern.  Ships have nationalities and numbers.
     The first ship of a nationality is number 0, the second
     number 1, etc.  Therefore, the first British ship in a game
     would be printed as "b0".	The second Brit would be "b1",
     and the fifth Don would be "s4".

     Ships can set normal sails, called Battle Sails, or bend on
     extra canvas called Full Sails.  A ship under full sail is a
     beautiful sight indeed, and it can move much faster than a
     ship under Battle Sails.  The only trouble is, with full
     sails set, there is so much tension on sail and rigging that
     a well aimed round shot can burst a sail into ribbons where
     it would only cause a little hole in a loose sail.  For this
     reason, rigging damage is doubled on a ship with full sails
     set.  Don't let that discourage you from using full sails.
     I like to keep them up right into the heat of battle.  A
     ship with full sails set has a capital letter for its
     nationality.  E.g., a Frog, "f0", with full sails set would
     be printed as "F0".

     When a ship is battered into a listing hulk, the last man
     aboard "strikes the colors."  This ceremony is the ship's
     formal surrender.	The nationality character of a surren-
     dered ship is printed as "!".  E.g., the Frog of our last
     example would soon be "!0".




Printed 7/9/88		  July 9, 1988				5






SAIL(6)             UNIX Programmer's Manual		  SAIL(6)



     A ship has a random chance of catching fire or sinking when
     it reaches the stage of listing hulk.  A sinking ship has a
     "~" printed for its nationality, and a ship on fire and
     about to explode has a "#" printed.

     Captured ships become the nationality of the prize crew.
     Therefore, if an American ship captures a British ship, the
     British ship will have an "a" printed for its nationality.
     In addition, the ship number is changed to "&","'", "(",
     ,")", "*", or "+" depending upon the original number, be it
     0,1,2,3,4, or 5.  E.g., the "b0" captured by an American
     becomes the "a&".	The "s4" captured by a Frog becomes the
     "f*".

     The ultimate example is, of course, an exploding Brit cap-
     tured by an American: "#&".

MMOOVVEEMMEENNTT
     Movement is the most confusing part of _S_a_i_l to many.  Ships
     can head in 8 directions:

				      0      0	    0
	     b	     b	     b0      b	     b	     b	     0b      b
	     0	      0                                             0

     The stern of a ship moves when it turns.  The bow remains
     stationary.  Ships can always turn, regardless of the wind
     (unless they are becalmed).  All ships drift when they lose
     headway.  If a ship doesn't move forward at all for two
     turns, it will begin to drift.  If a ship has begun to
     drift, then it must move forward before it turns, if it
     plans to do more than make a right or left turn, which is
     always possible.

     Movement commands to _S_a_i_l are a string of forward moves and
     turns.  An example is "l3".  It will turn a ship left and
     then move it ahead 3 spaces.  In the drawing above, the "b0"
     made 7 successive left turns.  When _S_a_i_l prompts you for a
     move, it prints three characters of import.  E.g.,
	  move (7, 4):
     The first number is the maximum number of moves you can
     make, including turns.  The second number is the maximum
     number of turns you can make.  Between the numbers is some-
     times printed a quote "'".  If the quote is present, it
     means that your ship has been drifting, and you must move
     ahead to regain headway before you turn (see note above).
     Some of the possible moves for the example above are as fol-
     lows:

	  move (7, 4): 7
	  move (7, 4): 1
	  move (7, 4): d      /* drift, or do nothing */

SAIL(6)             UNIX Programmer's Manual		  SAIL(6)



	  move (7, 4): 6r
	  move (7, 4): 5r1
	  move (7, 4): 4r1r
	  move (7, 4): l1r1r2
	  move (7, 4): 1r1r1r1

     Because square riggers performed so poorly sailing into the
     wind, if at any point in a movement command you turn into
     the wind, the movement stops there.  E.g.,

	  move (7, 4): l1l4
	  Movement Error;
	  Helm: l1l

     Moreover, whenever you make a turn, your movement allowance
     drops to min(what's left, what you would have at the new
     attitude).  In short, if you turn closer to the wind, you
     most likely won't be able to sail the full allowance printed
     in the "move" prompt.

     Old sailing captains had to keep an eye constantly on the
     wind.  Captains in _S_a_i_l are no different.	A ship's ability
     to move depends on its attitide to the wind.  The best angle
     possible is to have the wind off your quarter, that is, just
     off the stern.  The direction rose on the side of the screen
     gives the possible movements for your ship at all positions
     to the wind.  Battle sail speeds are given first, and full
     sail speeds are given in parenthesis.

			  0 1(2)

     Pretend the bow of your ship (the "^") is pointing upward
     and the wind is blowing from the bottom to the top of the
     page.  The numbers at the bottom "3(6)" will be your speed
     under battle or full sails in such a situation.  If the wind
     is off your quarter, then you can move "4(7)".  If the wind
     is off your beam, "3(6)".	If the wind is off your bow, then
     you can only move "1(2)".	Facing into the wind, you can't
     move at all.  Ships facing into the wind were said to be "in
     irons".

     the wind direction.  The wind blows from the + sign (high
     pressure) to the - sign (low pressure).  E.g.,

     The wind speeds are 0 = becalmed, 1 = light breeze, 2 =
     moderate breeze, 3 = fresh breeze, 4 = strong breeze, 5 =

     If two ships collide, they run the risk of becoming tangled
     together.	This is called "fouling."  Fouled ships are stuck
     together, and neither can move.  They can unfoul each other
     if they want to.  Boarding parties can only be sent across
     to ships when the antagonists are either fouled or grappled.

     Ships can grapple each other by throwing grapnels into the
     rigging of the other.

     The number of fouls and grapples you have are displayed on
     the upper right of the screen.

     Boarding was a very costly venture in terms of human life.
     Boarding parties may be formed in _S_a_i_l to either board an
     enemy ship or to defend your own ship against attack.  Men
     organized as Defensive Boarding Parties fight twice as hard
     to save their ship as men left unorganized.

     The boarding strength of a crew depends upon its quality and
     upon the number of men sent.

     The British seaman was world renowned for his sailing abili-
     ties.  American sailors, however, were actually the best
     seamen in the world.  Because the American Navy offered
     twice the wages of the Royal Navy, British seamen who liked
     the sea defected to America by the thousands.

     In _S_a_i_l, crew quality is quantized into 5 energy levels.
     "Elite" crews can outshoot and outfight all other sailors.
     "Crack" crews are next.  "Mundane" crews are average, and
     "Green" and "Mutinous" crews are below average.  A good rule
     of thumb is that "Crack" or "Elite" crews get one extra hit
     per broadside compared to "Mundane" crews.  Don't expect too
     much from "Green" crews.

     Your two broadsides may be loaded with four kinds of shot:

     Carronades only have a range of two, so you have to get in
     close to be able to fire them.  You have the choice of fir-
     ing at the hull or rigging of another ship.  If the range of
     the ship is greater than 6, then you may only shoot at the
     rigging.

     The types of shot and their advantages are:

RROOUUNNDD
     Range of 10.  Good for hull or rigging hits.

DDOOUUBBLLEE
     Range of 1.  Extra good for hull or rigging hits.	Double
     takes two turns to load.

CCHHAAIINN
     Range of 3.  Excellent for tearing down rigging.  Cannot
     damage hull or guns, though.

GGRRAAPPEE
     Range of 1.  Sometimes devastating against enemy crews.

     "Load" shows what your port (left) and starboard (right)
     broadsides are loaded with.  A "!" after the type of shot
     indicates that it is an initial broadside.  Initial broad-
     side were loaded with care before battle and before the
     decks ran red with blood.	As a consequence, initial broad-
     sides are a little more effective than broadsides loaded
     later.  A "*" after the type of shot indicates that the gun
     crews are still loading it, and you cannot fire yet.  "Hull"
     shows how much hull you have left.  "Crew" shows your three
     sections of crew.	As your crew dies off, your ability to
     fire decreases.  "Guns" and "Carr" show your port and star-
     board guns.  As you lose guns, your ability to fire
     decreases.  "Rigg" shows how much rigging you have on your 3
     or 4 masts.  As rigging is shot away, you lose mobility.

     is distance.  It is harder to hit a ship at range ten than
     it is to hit one sloshing alongside.  Next is raking.  Rak-
     ing fire, as mentioned before, can sometimes dismast a ship
     at range ten.  Next, crew size and quality affects the dam-
     age done by a broadside.	The number of guns firing also
     bears on the point, so to speak.  Lastly, weather affects
     the accuracy of a broadside.  If the seas are high (5 or 6),
     then the lower gunports of ships of the line can't even be
     opened to run out the guns.  This gives frigates and other
     flush decked vessels an advantage in a storm.  The scenario
     _P_e_l_l_e_w _v_s. _T_h_e _D_r_o_i_t_s _d_e _L'_H_o_m_m_e takes advantage of this
     peculiar circumstance.

     Repairs may be made to your Hull, Guns, and Rigging at the
     slow rate of two points per three turns.  The message
     "Repairs Completed" will be printed if no more repairs can
     be made.

     Computer ships in _S_a_i_l follow all the rules above with a few
     exceptions.  Computer ships never repair damage.  If they
     did, the players could never beat them.  They play well
     enough as it is.  As a consolation, the computer ships can
     fire double shot every turn.  That fluke is a good reason to
     keep your distance.  The _D_r_i_v_e_r figures out the moves of the
     computer ships.   It computes them with a typical A.I. dis-
     tance function and a depth first search to find the maximum
     "score." It seems to work fairly well, although I'll be the
     first to admit it isn't perfect.
