     Snake is a display-based game which must be played on a CRT
     terminal.	The object of the game is to make as much money
     as possible without getting eaten by the snake.  The --ll and
     --ww options allow you to specify the length and width of the
     field.  By default the entire screen (except for the last
     column) is used.

     You are represented on the screen by an I.  The snake is 6
     squares long and is represented by S's.  The money is $, and
     an exit is #.  Your score is posted in the upper left hand
     corner.

     You can move around using the same conventions as vi(1), the
     h, j, k, and l keys work, as do the arrow keys.  Other pos-
     sibilities include:

     sefc These keys are like hjkl but form a directed pad around
	  the d key.

     HJKL These keys move you all the way in the indicated direc-
	  tion to the same row or column as the money.	This does
	  _n_o_t let you jump away from the snake, but rather saves
	  you from having to type a key repeatedly.  The snake
	  still gets all his turns.

     SEFC Likewise for the upper case versions on the left.

     ATPB These keys move you to the four edges of the screen.
	  Their position on the keyboard is the mnemonic, e.g.	P
	  is at the far right of the keyboard.

     x	  This lets you quit the game at any time.

     p	  Points in a direction you might want to go.

     w	  Space warp to get out of tight squeezes, at a price.

     To earn money, move to the same square the money is on.  A
     new $ will appear when you earn the current one.  As you get
     richer, the snake gets hungrier.  To leave the game, move to
     the exit (#).

     A record is kept of the personal best score of each player.
     Scores are only counted if you leave at the exit, getting

     eaten by the snake is worth nothing.

     As in pinball, matching the last digit of your score to the
     number which appears after the game is worth a bonus.

     When playing on a small screen, it's hard to tell when you
     hit the edge of the screen.

     The scoring function takes into account the size of the
     screen.  A perfect function to do this equitably has not
     been devised.
