     _B_a_n_n_e_r prints a large, high quality banner on the standard
     output.  If the message is omitted, it prompts for and reads
     one line of its standard input.  If --ww is given, the output
     is scrunched down from a width of 132 to _n , suitable for a
     narrow terminal.  If _n is omitted, it defaults to 80.

     The output should be printed on a hard-copy device, up to
     132 columns wide, with no breaks between the pages. The
     volume is great enough that you may want a printer or a fast
     hardcopy terminal, but if you are patient, a decwriter or
     other 300 baud terminal will do.

BBUUGGSS
     Several ASCII characters are not defined, notably <, >, [,
     ], \, ^, _, {, }, |, and ~.  Also, the characters ", ', and
     & are funny looking (but in a useful way.)

     The --ww option is implemented by skipping some rows and
     columns.  The smaller it gets, the grainier the output.
     Sometimes it runs letters together.
