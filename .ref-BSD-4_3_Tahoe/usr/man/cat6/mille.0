     _M_i_l_l_e plays a two-handed game reminiscent of the Parker
     Brother's game of Mille Bournes with you.	The rules are
     described below.  If a file name is given on the command
     line, the game saved in that file is started.

     When a game is started up, the bottom of the score window
     will contain a list of commands.  They are:

     P	  Pick a card from the deck.  This card is placed in the
	  `P' slot in your hand.

     D	  Discard a card from your hand.  To indicate which card,
	  type the number of the card in the hand (or "P" for the
	  just-picked card) followed by a <RETURN> or <SPACE>.
	  The <RETURN or <SPACE> is required to allow recovery
	  from typos which can be very expensive, like discarding
	  safeties.

     U	  Use a card.  The card is again indicated by its number,
	  followed by a <RETURN> or <SPACE>.

     O	  Toggle ordering the hand.  By default off, if turned on
	  it will sort the cards in your hand appropriately.
	  This is not recommended for the impatient on slow ter-
	  minals.

     Q	  Quit the game.  This will ask for confirmation, just to
	  be sure.  Hitting <DELETE> (or <RUBOUT>) is equivalent.

     S	  Save the game in a file.  If the game was started from
	  a file, you will be given an opportunity to save it on
	  the same file.  If you don't wish to, or you did not
	  start from a file, you will be asked for the file name.
	  If you type a <RETURN> without a name, the save will be
	  terminated and the game resumed.

     R	  Redraw the screen from scratch.  The command ^L (con-
	  trol `L') will also work.

     W	  Toggle window type.  This switches the score window
	  between the startup window (with all the command names)
	  and the end-of-game window.  Using the end-of-game win-
	  dow saves time by eliminating the switch at the end of
	  the game to show the final score.  Recommended for
	  hackers and other miscreants.

     If you make a mistake, an error message will be printed on
     the last line of the score window, and a bell will beep.

     At the end of each hand or game, you will be asked if you
     wish to play another.  If not, it will ask you if you want
     to save the game.	If you do, and the save is unsuccessful,
     play will be resumed as if you had said you wanted to play
     another hand/game.  This allows you to use the " .}S 3 1 ""
     " "S"" "" " " "" "" "" "" command to reattempt the save.

     Here is some useful information.  The number in parentheses
     after the card name is the number of that card in the deck:

RRUULLEESS
     OObbjjeecctt: The point of this game is to get a total of 5000
     points in several hands.  Each hand is a race to put down
     exactly 700 miles before your opponent does.  Beyond the
     points gained by putting down milestones, there are several
     other ways of making points.

     OOvveerrvviieeww: The game is played with a deck of 101 cards.  _D_i_s_-
     _t_a_n_c_e cards represent a number of miles traveled.	They come
     in denominations of 25, 50, 75, 100, and 200.  When one is
     played, it adds that many miles to the player's trip so far
     this hand.  _H_a_z_a_r_d cards are used to prevent your opponent
     from putting down Distance cards.	They can only be played
     if your opponent has a _G_o card on top of the Battle pile.
     The cards are _O_u_t _o_f _G_a_s, _A_c_c_i_d_e_n_t, _F_l_a_t _T_i_r_e, _S_p_e_e_d _L_i_m_i_t,
     and _S_t_o_p.	_R_e_m_e_d_y cards fix problems caused by Hazard cards
     played on you by your opponent.  The cards are _G_a_s_o_l_i_n_e,
     _R_e_p_a_i_r_s, _S_p_a_r_e _T_i_r_e, _E_n_d _o_f _L_i_m_i_t, and _G_o.  _S_a_f_e_t_y cards
     prevent your opponent from putting specific Hazard cards on

     you in the first place.  They are _E_x_t_r_a _T_a_n_k, _D_r_i_v_i_n_g _A_c_e,
     _P_u_n_c_t_u_r_e _P_r_o_o_f, and _R_i_g_h_t _o_f _W_a_y, and there are only one of
     each in the deck.

     BBooaarrdd LLaayyoouutt: The board is split into several areas.  From
     top to bottom, they are: SSAAFFEETTYY AARREEAA (unlabeled): This is
     where the safeties will be placed as they are played.  HHAANNDD:
     These are the cards in your hand.	BBAATTTTLLEE: This is the Bat-
     tle pile.	All the Hazard and Remedy Cards are played here,
     except the _S_p_e_e_d _L_i_m_i_t and _E_n_d _o_f _L_i_m_i_t cards.  Only the top
     card is displayed, as it is the only effective one.  SSPPEEEEDD:
     The Speed pile.  The _S_p_e_e_d _L_i_m_i_t and _E_n_d _o_f _L_i_m_i_t cards are
     played here to control the speed at which the player is
     allowed to put down miles.  MMIILLEEAAGGEE: Miles are placed here.
     The total of the numbers shown here is the distance traveled
     so far.

     PPllaayy: The first pick alternates between the two players.
     Each turn usually starts with a pick from the deck.  The
     player then plays a card, or if this is not possible or
     desirable, discards one.  Normally, a play or discard of a
     single card constitutes a turn.  If the card played is a
     safety, however, the same player takes another turn immedi-
     ately.

     This repeats until one of the players reaches 700 points or
     the deck runs out.  If someone reaches 700, they have the
     option of going for an _E_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n, which means that the play
     continues until someone reaches 1000 miles.

     HHaazzaarrdd aanndd RReemmeeddyy CCaarrddss: Hazard Cards are played on your
     opponent's Battle and Speed piles.  Remedy Cards are used
     for undoing the effects of your opponent's nastiness.

	 GGoo (Green Light) must be the top card on your Battle
     pile for you to play any mileage, unless you have played the
     _R_i_g_h_t _o_f _W_a_y card (see below).
	 SSttoopp is played on your opponent's _G_o card to prevent
     them from playing mileage until they play a _G_o card.
	 SSppeeeedd LLiimmiitt is played on your opponent's Speed pile.
     Until they play an _E_n_d _o_f _L_i_m_i_t they can only play 25 or 50
     mile cards, presuming their _G_o card allows them to do even
     that.
	 EEnndd ooff LLiimmiitt is played on your Speed pile to nullify a
     _S_p_e_e_d _L_i_m_i_t played by your opponent.
	 OOuutt ooff GGaass is played on your opponent's _G_o card.  They
     must then play a _G_a_s_o_l_i_n_e card, and then a _G_o card before
     they can play any more mileage.
	 FFllaatt TTiirree is played on your opponent's _G_o card.  They
     must then play a _S_p_a_r_e _T_i_r_e card, and then a _G_o card before
     they can play any more mileage.
	 AAcccciiddeenntt is played on your opponent's _G_o card.  They

     must then play a _R_e_p_a_i_r_s card, and then a _G_o card before
     they can play any more mileage.

     SSaaffeettyy CCaarrddss: Safety cards prevent your opponent from play-
     ing the corresponding Hazard cards on you for the rest of
     the hand.	It cancels an attack in progress, and _a_l_w_a_y_s
     _e_n_t_i_t_l_e_s _t_h_e _p_l_a_y_e_r _t_o _a_n _e_x_t_r_a _t_u_r_n.
	 RRiigghhtt ooff WWaayy prevents your opponent from playing both
     _S_t_o_p and _S_p_e_e_d _L_i_m_i_t cards on you.  It also acts as a per-
     manent _G_o card for the rest of the hand, so you can play
     mileage as long as there is not a Hazard card on top of your
     Battle pile.  In this case only, your opponent can play
     Hazard cards directly on a Remedy card other than a Go card.
	 EExxttrraa TTaannkk When played, your opponent cannot play an _O_u_t
     _o_f _G_a_s on your Battle Pile.
	 PPuunnccttuurree PPrrooooff When played, your opponent cannot play a
     _F_l_a_t _T_i_r_e on your Battle Pile.
	 DDrriivviinngg AAccee When played, your opponent cannot play an
     _A_c_c_i_d_e_n_t on your Battle Pile.

     DDiissttaannccee CCaarrddss: Distance cards are played when you have a _G_o
     card on your Battle pile, or a Right of Way in your Safety
     area and are not stopped by a Hazard Card.  They can be
     played in any combination that totals exactly 700 miles,
     except that _y_o_u _c_a_n_n_o_t _p_l_a_y _m_o_r_e _t_h_a_n _t_w_o _2_0_0 _m_i_l_e _c_a_r_d_s _i_n
     _o_n_e _h_a_n_d.	A hand ends whenever one player gets exactly 700
     miles or the deck runs out.  In that case, play continues
     until neither someone reaches 700, or neither player can use
     any cards in their hand.  If the trip is completed after the
     deck runs out, this is called _D_e_l_a_y_e_d _A_c_t_i_o_n.

     CCoouupp FFoouurrrr''ee: This is a French fencing term for a counter-
     thrust move as part of a parry to an opponents attack.  In
     Mille Bournes, it is used as follows: If an opponent plays a
     Hazard card, and you have the corresponding Safety in your
     hand, you play it immediately, even _b_e_f_o_r_e you draw.  This
     immediately removes the Hazard card from your Battle pile,
     and protects you from that card for the rest of the game.
     This gives you more points (see "Scoring" below).

     SSccoorriinngg: Scores are totaled at the end of each hand, whether
     or not anyone completed the trip.	The terms used in the
     Score window have the following meanings:
	 MMiilleessttoonneess PPllaayyeedd: Each player scores as many miles as
     they played before the trip ended.
	 EEaacchh SSaaffeettyy: 100 points for each safety in the Safety
     area.
	 AAllll 44 SSaaffeettiieess: 300 points if all four safeties are
     played.
	 EEaacchh CCoouupp FFoouurr''ee: 300 points for each Coup Four'e accom-
     plished.

     The following bonus scores can apply only to the winning
     player.
	 TTrriipp CCoommpplleetteedd: 400 points bonus for completing the trip
     to 700 or 1000.
	 SSaaffee TTrriipp: 300 points bonus for completing the trip
     without using any 200 mile cards.
	 DDeellaayyeedd AAccttiioonn: 300 points bonus for finishing after the
     deck was exhausted.
	 EExxtteennssiioonn: 200 points bonus for completing a 1000 mile
     trip.
	 SShhuutt--OOuutt: 500 points bonus for completing the trip
     before your opponent played any mileage cards.

     Running totals are also kept for the current score for each
     player for the hand (HHaanndd TToottaall), the game (OOvveerraallll TToottaall),
