     This program lets you play backgammon against the computer
     or against a "friend".  All commands only are one letter, so
     you don't need to type a carriage return, except at the end
     of a move.  The program is mostly self documenting, so that
     a question mark (?) will usually get some help.  If you
     answer `y' when the program asks if you want the rules, you
     will get text explaining the rules of the game, some hints
     on strategy, instruction on how to use the program, and a
     tutorial consisting of a practice game against the computer.
     A description of how to use the program can be obtained by
     answering `y' when it asks if you want instructions.

     The possible arguments for backgammon (most are unnecessary
     but some are very convenient) consist of:

     nn	     don't ask for rules or instructions

     rr	     player is red (implies n)

     ww	     player is white (implies n)

     bb	     two players, red and white (implies n)

     pprr      print the board before red's turn

     ppww      print the board before white's turn

     ppbb      print the board before both player's turn

     tttteerrmm   terminal is type _t_e_r_m, uses /etc/termcap

     ssffiillee   recover previously saved game from _f_i_l_e.  (This can
	     also be done by executing the saved file, i.e., typ-
	     ing its name in as a command)

     Arguments may be optionally  preceded  by	a  `-'.   Several
     arguments may be concatenated together, but not after `s' or
     `t' arguments, since they can be followed	by  an	arbitrary
     string.   Any  unrecognized arguments are ignored.  An argu-
     ment of a lone `-' gets a description of possible arguments.

     If _t_e_r_m has capabilities for  direct  cursor  movement  (see
     _t_e_r_m_c_a_p(5))  _b_a_c_k_g_a_m_m_o_n ``fixes'' the board after each move,
     so the board does not  need  to  be  reprinted,  unless  the
     screen suffers some horrendous malady.  Also, any `p' option

     will be ignored.  (The `t' option is  not	necessary  unless
     the   terminal   type  does  not  match  the  entry  in  the
     /etc/termcap data base.)

QQUUIICCKK RREEFFEERREENNCCEE
     When the program prompts by typing only your color,  type	a
     space or carriage return to roll, or

     dd	     to double

     pp	     to print the board

     qq	     to quit

     ss	     to save the game for later

     When the program prompts with 'Move:', type

     pp	     to print the board

     qq	     to quit

     ss	     to save the game

     or a _m_o_v_e, which is a sequence of

     ss--ff     move from ss to ff

     ss//rr     move one man on ss the roll rr

     separated by commas or spaces and	ending	with  a  newline.
     Available abbreviations are

     ss--ff11--ff22   means ss--ff11,,ff11--ff22

     ss//rr11rr22    means ss//rr11,,ss//rr22

     Use `b' for bar and `h' for home, or 0 or 25 as appropriate.

     The program's strategy needs much work.
