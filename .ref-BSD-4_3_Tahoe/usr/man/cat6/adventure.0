     The object of the game is to locate and explore Colossal
     Cave, find the treasures hidden there, and bring them back
     to the building with you.	The program is self-descriptive
     to a point, but part of the game is to discover its rules.

     To terminate a game, type `quit'; to save a game for later
     resumption, type `suspend'.

BBUUGGSS
     Saving a game creates a large executable file instead of
     just the information needed to resume the game.
