     _P_h_a_n_t_a_s_i_a is a role playing game which allows players to
     roll up characters of various types to fight monsters and
     other players.  Progression of characters is based upon
     gaining experience from fighting monsters (and other
     players).

     Most of the game is menu driven and self-explanatory (more
     or less).	The screen is cursor updated, so be sure to set
     up the TTEERRMM variable in your environment.

     The options provide for a variety of functions to support
     the game.	They are:

     --ss   Invokes _p_h_a_n_t_a_s_i_a without header information.

     --mm   Get a monster listing.

     --aa   Get a listing of all character names on file.

     --xx   Examine/change a particular character on file.

     --hh   Print a help listing (this message).

     --HH   Print header only.

     --pp   Purge old characters.

     --bb   Show scoreboard of top characters per login.

     --SS   Turn on wizard options, if allowed.

     The characters are saved on a common file, in order to make
     the game interactive between players.  The characters are
     given a password in order to retrieve them later.	Only
     characters above lleevveell zero are saved.  Characters unused
     for awhile will be purged.  Characters are only placed on
     the scoreboard when they die.

     NNoorrmmaall PPllaayy

     A number of the player's more important statistics are
     almost always displyed on the screen, with maximums (where
     applicable) in parentheses.

     The character is placed randomly near the center of a carte-
     sian system.  Most commands are selected with a single
     letter or digit.  For example, one may move by hitting 'W',
     'S', 'N', or 'E', (lower case may also be used, at no time
     is the game case dependent).  One may also use 'H', 'J',
     'K', 'L', for movement, similar to _v_i(1).	To move to a
     specific (x, y) coordinate, use the mmoovvee ('1') command. The
     distance a character can move is calculated by 1 plus 1.5
     per lleevveell.. Moving in a compass direction will move the
     player the maximum allowed distance in that direction.

     A player may see who else is playing by using the ppllaayyeerrss
     ('2') option.  One may see the coordinates of those who are
     the same distance or closer to the origin as he/she.  KKiinnggss,,
     and ccoouunncciill ooff tthhee wwiissee can see and can be seen by everyone.
     A ppaallaannttiirr removes these retrictions.

     One can talk to other players with the ttaallkk ('3') option.
     In general, this is a line or so of text.	To remove a
     current message, just type <return> when prompted for a mes-
     sage.

     The ssttaattss ('4') option shows additional characteristics of a
     player.

     One may leave the game either with the qquuiitt ('5') option.

     One may rest by default.  Resting lets one regain maximum
     eenneerrggyy lleevveell,, and also lets one find mmaannaa (more is found for
     larger levels and further distances from the origin).

     One may call a monster by hitting '9' or 'C'.

     Use 'X' to examine other players.

     One may quit or execute a sub-shell by hitting interrupt.
     Quitting during battle results in death for obvious reasons.

     Several other options become available as the player
     progresses in lleevveell and mmaaggiicc,, or to other stations in the
     game ( vvaallaarr,, ccoouunncciill ooff tthhee wwiissee,, kkiinngg ).  These are
     described elsewhere.  In general, a control-L will force the
     redrawing of the screen.

     Other things which may happen are more or less self-
     explanatory.

     FFiigghhttiinngg MMoonnsstteerrss

     A player has several options while fighting monsters.  They
     are as follows:

     mmeelleeee	    Inflicts damage on the monster, based upon
		    ssttrreennggtthh.. Also decreases the monster's
		    ssttrreennggtthh some.

     sskkiirrmmiisshh	    Inflicts a little less damage than mmeelleeee,, but
		    decreases the monster's qquuiicckknneessss instead.

     eevvaaddee	    Attempt to run away.  Success is based upon
		    both the player's and the monster's bbrraaiinnss
		    and qquuiicckknneessss..

     ssppeellll	    Several options for throwing spells
		    (described elsewhere).

     nniicckk	    Hits the monster one plus the player's sswwoorrdd,,
		    and gives the player 10% of the monster's
		    eexxppeerriieennccee.. Decreases the monster's eexxppeerrii--
		    eennccee an amount proportional to the amount
		    granted.  This also increases the monster's
		    quickness.	Paralyzed monsters wake up very
		    fast when nicked.

     lluucckkoouutt	    This is essentially a battle of wits with the
		    monster. Success is based upon the player's
		    and the monster's bbrraaiinnss.. The player gets
		    credit for slaying the monster if he/she
		    succeeds.  Otherwise, nothing happens, and
		    the chance to lluucckkoouutt is lost.

     CChhaarraacctteerr SSttaattiissttiiccss

     ssttrreennggtthh	    determines how much damage a character can
		    inflict.

     qquuiicckknneessss	    determines how many chances a character gets
		    to make decisions while fighting.

     eenneerrggyy lleevveell   specifies how much damage a character may
		    endure before dying.

     mmaaggiicc lleevveell    determines which spells a character may
		    throw, and how effective those spells will
		    be.

     bbrraaiinnss	    basically, the character's intelligence; used
		    for various fighting options and spells.

     eexxppeerriieennccee     gained by fighting monsters and other charac-
		    ters.

     lleevveell	    indicative of how much experience a character
		    has accumulated; progresses geometrically as
		    eexxppeerriieennccee increases.

     ppooiissoonn	    sickness which degrades a character's perfor-
		    mance (affects eenneerrggyy lleevveell and ssttrreennggtthh ).

     ssiinn	    accumulated as a character does certain nasty
		    things; used only rarely in normal play of
		    the game.

     aaggee	    of player; roughly equivalent to number of
		    turns.  As aaggee increases, many personal
		    statistics degenerate.

     CChhaarraacctteerr TTyyppeess

     Character statistics are rolled randomly from the above
     list, according to character type.  The types are as fol-
     lows:

     mmaaggiicc uusseerr     strong in mmaaggiicc lleevveell and bbrraaiinnss , weak in
		    other areas.   Must rely on wits and magic to
		    survive.

     ffiigghhtteerr	    good in ssttrreennggtthh and eenneerrggyy lleevveell , fairly
		    good in other areas.  This adds up to a
		    well-equipped fighter.

     eellff	    very high qquuiicckknneessss and above average mmaaggiicc
		    lleevveell are eellvveess selling points.

     ddwwaarrff	    very high ssttrreennggtthh and eenneerrggyy lleevveell , but
		    with a tendency to be rather slow and not too
		    bright.

     hhaallfflliinngg	    rather quick and smart, with high eenneerrggyy
		    lleevveell , but poor in mmaaggiicc and ssttrreennggtthh.. Born
		    with some eexxppeerriieennccee..

     eexxppeerriimmeennttoo    very mediocre in all areas.  However, the
		    eexxppeerriimmeennttoo may be placed almost anywhere
		    within the playing grid.

     The possible ranges for starting statistics are summarized
     in the following table.

     Not only are the starting characteristics different for the
     different character types, the characteristics progress at
     different rates for the different types as the character
     goes up in lleevveell.. EExxppeerriimmeennttooeess'' characteristics progress
     randomly as one of the other types.  The progression as
     characters increase in lleevveell is summarized in the following
     table.

     The character type also determines how much gold a player
     may carry, how long until rriinnggss can overcome the player, and
     how much ppooiissoonn the player can withstand.

     SSppeellllss

		    from finding the character, as well as hiding
		    the player from other players.  His/her coor-
		    dinates show up as '?' in the ppllaayyeerrss option.
		    Players cannot collect mmaannaa,, find trading

     MMoonnsstteerrss

     Monsters get bigger as one moves farther from the origin
     (0,0).  Rings of distance 125 from the origin determine the
     size.  A monster's eexxppeerriieennccee,, eenneerrggyy lleevveell,, and bbrraaiinnss are
     multiplied by the size.  SSttrreennggtthh is increase 50% per size
     over one, and qquuiicckknneessss remains the same, regardless of
     size.

     Also, nastier monsters are found as one progress farther out
     from the origin.  Monsters also may flock.  The percent
     chance of that happening is designated as fflloocckk%% in the mon-
     ster listing.  Monsters outside the first ring may carry
     treasure, as determined by their treasure type.  Flocking
     monsters, and bigger monsters increase the chances of treas-
     ure.

     Certain monsters have special abilities; they are as fol-
     lows:

     A monster may also be carrying ggoolldd or ggeemmss.. These are used
     at ttrraaddiinngg ppoossttss to buy things. A ggeemm is worth 1000 gold
     pieces.  Too much ggoolldd will slow a player down.  One may
     carry 1000 plus 200 per lleevveell of ggoolldd.. A ggeemm weighs one half
     a gold piece.  Monsters of treasure type 7 or higher may
     carry ggeemmss..

     The chance of a cursed treasure is based upon treasure type.
     The more valuable treasures have a greater chance of being
     cursed.  A cursed treasure knocks eenneerrggyy lleevveell very low, and
     adds 0.25 ppooiissoonn..

     RRiinnggss

     RRiinnggss are only carried by nnaazzgguullss and DDaarrkk LLoorrdd.. They come
     in four different flavors.  All rriinnggss rest the player to
     maximum and cause him/her to hit much harder in battle with
     monsters (assuming one has chosen to use the rriinngg for bat-
     tle.)

     Two types of rriinnggss are cursed and come either from nnaazzgguullss
     or DDaarrkk LLoorrdd.. After a few times of using these types, the
     player falls under the control of the rriinngg,, and strange,
     random things will occur.	Eventually, the player dies, and
     gives his/her name to a monster on the file.  Dying before
     the rriinngg is used up also renames the monster.

     The two remaining types of rriinnggss are much more benign.  The
     one from a nnaazzgguull is good for a limited number of battle
     rounds, and will save the player from death if it was being
     used when he/she died.  The one from DDaarrkk LLoorrdd is the same,
     except that it never is used up.  rriinnggss disappear after sav-
     ing someone from death.  In general, cursed rriinnggss occur much
     more often than normal ones.  It is usually not a good idea
     to pick one up.  The only way to get rid of a rriinngg is to
     have a monster steal it.

     KKiinngg

     A player may become kkiinngg bbyy ffiinnddiinngg aa _c_r_o_w_n and going to
     (0,0).  Players must have a lleevveell in the range of 10 to 1000
     to be able to find a _c_r_o_w_n. When a player with one or more
     _c_r_o_w_n_s reaches lleevveell 1000, the _c_r_o_w_n_s are converted to _g_o_l_d.

     Once a player is king, he/she may do certain things while in
     the Lord's Chamber (0,0).	These are exercised with the
     ddeeccrreeee ('0') option.

     _t_r_a_n_s_p_o_r_t	    This is done to another player.  It randomly
		    moves the affected player about.  A cchhaarrmm
		    protects from transports.




Printed 7/10/88               GAMES			       11






PHANTASIA(6)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	     PHANTASIA(6)



     _c_u_r_s_e	    This is done to another player.  It is analo-
		    gous to cursed treasure, but worse.  It
		    inflicts two ppooiissoonn,, knocks eenneerrggyy lleevveell very
		    low, and degrades the maximum energy.  It
		    also removes a ccllooaakk.. A bblleessssiinngg protects
		    from king's curses.

     _e_n_e_r_g_y _v_o_i_d    The king may put a number these scattered
		    about his/her kingdom as he/she pleases.  If
		    a player hits one, he/she loses mmaannaa,, eenneerrggyy,,
		    and ggoolldd.. The energy void disappears after
		    being hit.

     _b_e_s_t_o_w	    This is also done to another player.  The
		    king may wish to reward one or more loyal
		    subjects by sharing his/her riches ( ggoolldd ).
		    Or it is a convenient way to dispose of some
		    unwanted deadweight.

     _c_o_l_l_e_c_t _t_a_x_e_s  Everyone pays 7% tax on all ggoolldd and ggeemmss
		    acquired, regardless of the existence of a
		    kkiinngg.. The king collects the accrued taxes
		    with this option.

     The kkiinngg may also tteelleeppoorrtt anywhere for free by using the
     origin as a starting place.

     CCoouunncciill ooff tthhee WWiissee,, VVaallaarr

     A player automatically becomes a member of the ccoouunncciill ooff
     tthhee wwiissee upon reaching level 3000.  Members of the council
     cannot have rriinnggss.. Members of the council have a few extra
     options which they can exercise.  These are exercised iinntteerr--
     vveennee ('8') option.  All iinntteerrvveennee options cost 1000 mana.
     One iinntteerrvveennee option is to _h_e_a_l another player.  This is
     just a quick way for that player to be rested to maximum and
     lose a little ppooiissoonn.. The main purpose in life for members
     of the council is to seek the HHoollyy GGrraaiill.. This is done with
     a ppaallaannttiirr under the _s_e_e_k _g_r_a_i_l option.  The distance cited
     by the seek is accurate within 10%, in order not to make it
     too easy to find the grail.  A player must have infin-
     tesimally small ssiinn,, or else it's all over upon finding the
     grail.  In order to help members of the council on their
     quest, they may _t_e_l_e_p_o_r_t with greater ease.

     Upon finding the grail, the player advance to position of
     vvaallaarr.. He/she may then exercise more and niftier options
     under _i_n_t_e_r_v_e_n_t_i_o_n. These include all of the council
     members' option plus the ability to move other players
     about, bless them, and throw monsters at them.  A vvaallaarr's
     blessing has the same effect as the treasure _b_l_e_s_s_i_n_g,
     except that the affected player does not get his/her

     other players age the player who uses them.  VVaallaarr are
     essentially immortal, but are actually given five lives.  If
     these are used up, the player is left to die, and becomes an
     eexx--vvaallaarr.. VVaallaarr cannot _m_o_v_e, _t_e_l_e_p_o_r_t, or call monsters.
     (An exception to this is if the _v_a_l_a_r finds a _t_r_a_n_s_p_o_r_t_e_r.
     This is to allow him/her to dispose of excess _g_o_l_d. Any mon-
     sters which a vvaallaarr encounters are based upon his/her size.
     Only one valar may exists at a time.  The current valar is
     replaced when another player finds the grail.  The valar is
     then bumped back to the council of the wise.

     WWiizzaarrdd

     The _w_i_z_a_r_d is usually the owner of the game, and the one who
     maintains the associated files.  The _w_i_z_a_r_d is granted spe-
     cial powers within the game, if it is invoked with the '-S'
     option.  Otherwise, the _w_i_z_a_r_d plays no different from other
     players.  The _w_i_z_a_r_d abilities are outlined below.

     _c_h_a_n_g_e _p_l_a_y_e_r_s
	  When examining a player, (game invoked with '-x', or

     Certain regions of the playing grid have different names.
     In general, this is only to give the player some idea of
     his/her present location.	Some special places do exist.

     _T_r_a_d_i_n_g _P_o_s_t_s  These are located at |x| == |y| == n*n*100
		    for n = 1, 2...1000.  Trading posts farther
		    out have more things for sale.  Be careful
		    about cheating the merchants there, as they
		    have short tempers.  Merchants are dishonest
		    about 5% of the time.

     _L_o_r_d'_s _C_h_a_m_b_e_r This is located at (0,0).  Only players with
		    ccrroowwnnss may enter.

     Once a player reaches lleevveell 5, the game will start to time
     out waiting for input.  This is to try to keep the game a
     bit faster paced.

     A _g_u_r_u will never be disgusted with your ssiinnss if they are
     less than one.

     A _m_e_d_i_c wants half of a player's ggoolldd to be happy.  Offering
     more than one has, or a negative amount will anger the

     gets the first hit.  If the two players are severely mis-
     matched, the stronger player is drastically handicapped for
     the battle.  In order to protect from being stuck in an
     infinite loop, the player waiting for response may time out.
     Options for battle are:

     _f_i_g_h_t	    Inflicts damage upon other person.

     _r_u_n _a_w_a_y	    Escape from battle.  Has a 75% chance of

     Sometimes waits for the other player may be excessive,
