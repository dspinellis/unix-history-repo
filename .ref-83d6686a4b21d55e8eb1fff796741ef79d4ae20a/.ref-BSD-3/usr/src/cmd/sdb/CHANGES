	file or if any source files are newer than the object file.

	argument to an r command was a number greater that 1 has been
	fixed.

	I/O redirection with the r command has been fixed.

Version 2.3  November 11, 1979

Version 2.1  September 17, 1979

	The `s' and `a' formats now accept optional integers which specify a
	length.

	Strings printed without a length specification are truncated at
	length 128.

	A new format `p' interprets the value as a pointer to a procedure
	and prints the name of the procedure pointed to.

	The shell metacharacters `*' and `?' may be used for matching
	procedure and variable names.

	A number of bugs with F77 programs have been fixed.
