     The fortran-77 I/O library, libI77.a, has  been  exten-
sively  updated.   All  known  bugs have been fixed, and I/O
error reporting has  been  improved.   Several  non-standard
extensions to FORTRAN I/O have been added.

     Some general concepts regarding f77 I/O deserve clarif-
ication.  There are three forms of I/O: formatted, unformat-
ted, and list-directed. The last is related to formatted but
does  not  obey  all the rules for formatted I/O.  There are
two modes of access to external and internal  files:  direct
and  sequential.  The definition of a logical record depends
upon the combination of I/O form and mode specified  by  the
fortran I/O statement.

     A logical record in direct access external files  is  a
string  of  bytes  of  a  length  specified when the file is
opened.  Read and write statements must not specify  logical
records  longer  than  the  original record size definition.
Shorter logical records  are  allowed.   Unformatted  direct
writes  leave  the  unfilled  part  of the record undefined.
Formatted direct writes cause the unfilled record to be pad-
ded with blanks.

     Logical records in sequentially accessed external files
may  be  of  arbitrary  and variable length.  Logical record
length for unformatted sequential files is determined by the
size  of  items  in  the iolist.  For formatted write state-
ments, logical record length is  determined  by  the  format
statement  interacting  with  the  iolist at execution time.
Formatted sequential  access  causes  one  or  more  logical
records ending with 'newline' characters to be read or writ-
ten.

     Logical record length for list-directed  I/O  is  rela-
tively  meaningless.  On output, the record length is depen-
dent on the magnitude of the  data  items.   On  input,  the
record  length  is determined by the data types and the file
contents.









                           - 2 -


     The logical record length for "internal" files  is  the
length  of  the  character variable or array element. Thus a
simple character variable is  a  single  logical  record.  A
character variable array is similar to a fixed length direct
access file, and obeys the same rules.  Unformatted  I/O  is
not allowed on "internal" files.

     Note that each execution of a fortran  unformatted  I/O
statement causes a single logical record to be read or writ-
ten. Each execution of a  fortran  formatted  I/O  statement
causes one or more logical records to be read or written.

     Any error detected during I/O processing will cause the
program  to  abort unless alternate action has been provided
for specifically in the  program.   Any  I/O  statement  may
include  an  err=  clause (and iostat= clause) to specify an
alternate branch to be  taken  on  errors  (and  return  the
specific  error code).  Read or write statements may include
end= to branch on end-of-file.  File position and the  value
of I/O list items is undefined following an error.

I. Implementation details.

     The maximum number of logical units that a program  may
have  open  at  one time has been set to correspond with the
UNIX system limit, currently 20.  However, the  I/O  library
uses  UNIX  file  access  for  internal purposes.  Therefore
fatal errors are possible if the maximum number of files are
open.   Specifically,  'close'  or 'endfile' on an old file,
and "'inquire' by file" may fail.

     Vertical format control  is  implemented.  The  logical
unit  must  be  opened  for  sequential  access  and "form =
'print'"  (see  below).   Control  codes  '0'  and  '1'  are
replaced in the output file with '\n' and '\f' respectively.
The control character '+' isn't implemented  and,  like  any
other character in the first position of a record written to
a "print" file, is dropped.  No vertical format  control  is
recognized for direct formatted output or list directed out-
put.

     Default logical units 0, 5, and  6  can  be  re-defined
with  an  'open' statement.  To preserve error reporting, it
is an error to close logical unit 0.  If you  want  to  open
the  default  filename  for  any  preconnected logical unit,
remember to 'close' the unit first.  Redefining the standard
units  may  impair normal console I/O.  An alternative is to
use shell re-direction to  externally  re-define  the  above
units.   To re-define default blank control or format of the
standard input or output files,  use  the  'open'  statement
specifying the unit number and no filename (see below).

     An 'open' statement need not specify a filename. If  it
refers to a logical unit that is already open, the "blank= "









                           - 3 -


and "form= " specifiers may be redefined  without  affecting
the current file position.  Otherwise, if "status='scratch'"
is specified, a temporary file  with  a  name  of  the  form
'tmp.FXXXXXX'  will  be  opened,  and,  by  default, will be
deleted when closed or during termination of program  execu-
tion.   Any other "status= " specifier without an associated
filename results in opening a file named 'fort.N' where N is
the specified logical unit number.  It is an error to try to
open an existing file with "status='new'".  It is  an  error
to  try  to open a nonexistent file with "status='old'".  By
default "status='unknown'" will be assumed, and a file  will
be created if necessary.  Existing files are never truncated
on opening but are positioned at the end-of-file.

     Sequentially accessed external files are  truncated  to
the  current  file  position  on  'close',  'backspace',  or
'rewind' only if the last access to the file was a write.

     Upper as well as lower case characters  are  recognized
in format statements and all alphabetic arguments to the I/O
library routines.  This has always been true for  statements
that  are part of the source code, but not for format state-
ments or character arguments from a file.

     If the external representation of a datum is too  large
for the field width specified, the specified field is filled
with asterisks (*).  On 'Ew.dEe' output, the e field will be
filled  with asterisks if the exponent representation is too
large.  (This will only happen if e==0)

     List-directed output of complex values now includes  an
appropriate  comma.   List-directed output now distinguishes
between real*4 and  real*8  values  and  formats  them  dif-
ferently.   Output  of a character string that includes '\n'
now works correctly.

     If I/O errors are not trapped by the user's program  an
appropriate error message will be written to 'stderr' before
aborting.  An error number will be printed in [ ] along with
a  brief  error  message  showing  the  logical unit and I/O
state.  Error numbers < 100 refer to UNIX  errors,  and  are
described  in  the  introduction  to  chapter  2 of the UNIX
Programmer's Manual.  Error numbers >= 100 come from the I/O
library,  and  are described further in the appendix to this
writeup.  For internal I/O,  part  of  the  string  will  be
printed with '|' at the current position in the string.  For
external I/O, part of the current record will  be  displayed
if  the error was caused during reading from a file that can
backspace.

     Direct access list-directed I/O is not allowed.  Unfor-
matted  internal I/O is not allowed.  Both the above will be
caught by the  compiler.   All  other  flavors  of  I/O  are
allowed, although some are not part of the ANSI standard.









                           - 4 -


     The standard units, 0, 5, and 6, are now  named  inter-
nally  'stderr',  'stdin', and 'stdout' respectively.  These
are not actual filenames and can not  be  used  for  opening
these units.  'inquire' will not return these names and will
indicate that the above units are not named unless they have
been  opened  to  real  files.   The names are meant to make
error reporting more meaningful.

     On output, a real value that is truly zero will display
as  '0.' to distinguish it from a very small non-zero value.
This occurs in 'F', 'E', 'D', and 'G' format conversions.

     Non-destructive tabbing is implemented for both  inter-
nal  and  external  formatted I/O.  Tabbing left or right on
output does not affect  previously  written  portions  of  a
record.   Tabbing  right on output causes unwritten portions
of a record to be filled with blanks.  Tabbing left or right
off  the  end  of  a logical record is an error.  The format
specifier 'T'  must  be  followed  by  a  positive  non-zero
number.  If it is not, it will have a different meaning (See
below).  Note that spacing with 'X' always writes blanks  in
the output record.

II. Non-"ANSI Standard" Extensions

     B is an acceptable edit control  specifier.  It  causes
return  to  the  default mode of blank interpretation (NULL)
and is identical to BN.  This is  consistent  with  S  which
returns to default sign control.

     P by itself is equivalent to 0P. It  resets  the  scale
factor to the default value, 0.

     The form of the  'Ew.dEe'  format  specifier  has  been
extended  to  'D' also.  The form 'Ew.d.e' is allowed but is
not standard.  The 'e' field specifies the minimum number of
digits  or  spaces  in the exponent field on output.  If the
value of the exponent is too large,  the  exponent  notation
'e' or 'd' will be dropped from the output to allow one more
character position.  If this is still not adequate, the  'e'
field  will  be filled with asterisks (*). The default value
for 'e' is 2.

     An additional form of  tab  control  specification  has
been  added.  The ANSI standard forms 'TRn', 'TLn', and 'Tn'
are supported where n is a positive non-zero number. If  'T'
or  'nT' is specified, tabbing will be to the next (or n-th)
8-column tab stop.  Thus columns  of  alphanumerics  can  be
lined  up without counting.  (See above for a description of
the tabbing implementation.)

     A format control specifier has been added  to  suppress
the  newline  at  the  end of the last record of a formatted
sequential write. The specifier is a dollar sign ($). It  is









                           - 5 -


constrained  by  the same rules as the colon (:). It is used
typically for console prompts.  For example:


        write (*, "('enter value for x: ',$)")
        read (*,*) x


     Radices other than 10 can be  specified  for  formatted
integer  I/O conversion. The specifier is patterned after P,
the pre-scale  factor  for  floating  point  conversion.  It
remains in effect until another radix is specified or format
interpretation is complete. The specifier is defined as [n]R
where  2  <=  n  <= 36. If n is omitted, the default decimal
radix is restored.

     In conjunction with the above, a sign control specifier
has  been added to cause integer values to be interpreted as
unsigned during output conversion. The specifier is  SU  and
remains  in  effect  until another sign control specifier is
encountered, or format interpretation is complete. Radix and
'unsigned'  specifiers could be used to format a hexadecimal
dump, as follows:


        2000    format( SU, 16R, 8I10.8)


Note: Unsigned integer values greater than (2**30 - 1), i.e.
any  signed negative value, can not be read by FORTRAN input
routines.  All internal values will be output correctly.

     The ANSI standard is ambiguous regarding the definition
of  a "print" file.  Since UNIX has no default "print" file,
an additional 'form' specifier  is  now  recognized  in  the
'open'  statement.   Specifying "form='print'" implies 'for-
matted' and enables vertical format control for that logical
unit  (see  above).   Vertical format control is interpreted
only on sequential formatted writes to a "print" file.

     The 'inquire' statement  will  return  'print'  in  the
'FORM='  string variable for logical units opened as "print"
files.  It will return -1 for the unit number of  an  uncon-
nected file.

     If a logical unit is already open, an 'open'  statement
including the re-define those options.  This instance of the
'open' statement need not include the filename, and must not
include  a  filename if 'unit=' refers to the standard input
or outputs.  Therefore, to re-define the standard output  as
a "print" file, use:


        open (unit=6, form='print')









                           - 6 -


     In a 'close' statement, "status='keep'" may  be  speci-
fied for temporary files.  This is the default for all other
files.   Remember  to  get  the  file's  real  name,   using
'inquire', if you want to re-open it later.

     List directed read has been modified to allow input  of
a  string  not enclosed in quotes. The string must not start
with a digit, and can not contain a separator (,  or  /)  or
blank  (space  or  tab). A newline will terminate the string
unless escaped with \. Any string not meeting the above res-
trictions must be enclosed in quotes (" or ').

     Internal list-directed I/O has been implemented. During
internal list reads, bytes are consummed until the iolist is
satisfied, or the 'end-of-file' is reached.  During internal
list  writes,  records are filled until the iolist is satis-
fied.  The length of an internal array element should be  at
least 20 bytes to avoid logical record overflow when writing
double precision values.  Internal list read was implemented
to  make  command line decoding easier.  Internal list write
should be avoided.

                         Appendix A
                 I/O Library Error Messages

     The following error messages are generated by  the  I/O
library.   The  error  numbers are returned in the "iostat="
variable if the "err=" return is taken. Error numbers <  100
are  generated  by  UNIX.  See  the UNIX Programmers Manual,
introduction to chapter 2.

        /* 100 */       "error in format"
                        See error message output for the location
                        of the error in the format. Can be caused
                        by more than 10 levels of nested (), or
                        an extremely long format statement.

        /* 101 */       "illegal unit number"
                        It is illegal to close logical unit 0.
                        Negative unit numbers are not allowed.
                        The upper limit is system dependent.

        /* 102 */       "formatted io not allowed"
                        The logical unit was opened for
                        unformatted I/O.

        /* 103 */       "unformatted io not allowed"
                        The logical unit was opened for
                        formatted I/O.

        /* 104 */       "direct io not allowed"
                        The logical unit was opened for sequential
                        access, or the logical record length was
                        specified as 0.

        /* 105 */       "sequential io not allowed"
                        The logical unit was opened for direct
                        access I/O.

        /* 106 */       "can't backspace file"
                        The file associated with the logical unit
                        can't seek. May be a device or a pipe.

        /* 107 */       "off beginning of record"
                        The format specified a left tab off the
                        beginning of the record.

        /* 108 */       "can't stat file"
                        The system can't return status information
                        about the file. Perhaps the directory is
                        unreadable.

        /* 109 */       "no * after repeat count"
                        Repeat counts in list-directed I/O must be
                        followed by an * with no blank spaces.










                           - 8 -


        /* 110 */       "off end of record"
                        A formatted write tried to go beyond the
                        logical end-of-record. An unformatted read
                        or write will also cause this.

        /* 111 */       "truncation failed"
                        The truncation of external sequential files
                        on 'close', 'backspace', or 'rewind' tries
                        to do a copy. It failed. Perhaps the temp
                        file couldn't be created.

        /* 112 */       "incomprehensible list input"
                        List input has to be just right.

        /* 113 */       "out of free space"
                        The library dynamically creates buffers for
                        internal use. You ran out of memory for this.
                        Your program is too big!

        /* 114 */       "unit not connected"
                        The logical unit was not open.

        /* 115 */       "read unexpected character"
                        Certain format conversions can't tolerate
                        non-numeric data. Logical data must be
                        T or F.

        /* 116 */       "blank logical input field"

        /* 117 */       "'new' file exists"
                        You tried to open an existing file with
                        "status='new'".

        /* 118 */       "can't find 'old' file"
                        You tried to open a non-existent file
                        with "status='old'".

        /* 119 */       "unknown system error"
                        Shouldn't happen, but .....
                        (Send me a documented example.)

        /* 120 */       "requires seek ability"
                        Direct access requires seek ability.
                        Sequential unformatted I/O requires seek
                        ability on the file due to the special
                        data structure required. Tabbing left
                        also requires seek ability.

        /* 121 */       "illegal argument"
                        Certain arguments to 'open', etc. will be
                        checked for legitimacy. Often only non-
                        default forms are looked for.
