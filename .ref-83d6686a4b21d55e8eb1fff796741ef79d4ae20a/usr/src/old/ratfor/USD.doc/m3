IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
Ratfor
was originally written in
C[4]
on the
.UC UNIX
operating system[5].
The language is specified by a context free grammar
and the compiler constructed using
the
.UC YACC
compiler-compiler[6].
.PP
The
Ratfor
grammar is simple and straightforward, being essentially
.P1
prog	: stat 
	| prog   stat
stat	: \f3if\fP (...) stat 
	| \f3if\fP (...) stat \f3else\fP stat
	| \f3while\fP (...) stat
	| \f3for\fP (...; ...; ...) stat
	| \f3do\fP ... stat
	| \f3repeat\fP stat
	| \f3repeat\fP stat \f3until\fP (...)
	| \f3switch\fP (...) { \f3case\fP ...: prog ...
			\f3default\fP: prog }
	| \f3return\fP
	| \f3break\fP
	| \f3next\fP
	| digits   stat
	| { prog }
	| anything unrecognizable
.P2
The observation
that
Ratfor
knows no Fortran
follows directly from the rule that says a statement is
``anything unrecognizable''.
In fact most of Fortran falls into this category,
since any statement that does not begin with one of the keywords
is by definition ``unrecognizable.''
.PP
Code generation is also simple.
If the first thing on a source line is
not a keyword
(like
.UL if ,
.UL else ,
etc.)
the entire statement is simply copied to the output
with appropriate character translation and formatting.
(Leading digits are treated as a label.)
Keywords cause only slightly more complicated actions.
For example, when
.UL if
is recognized, two consecutive labels L and L+1
are generated and the value of L is stacked.
The condition is then isolated, and the code
.P1
if (.not. (condition)) goto L
.P2
is output.
The 
.ul
statement
part of the
.UL if
is then translated.
When the end of the 
statement is encountered
(which may be some distance away and include nested \f3if\fP's, of course),
the code
.P1
L	continue
.P2
is generated, unless there is an
.UL else
clause, in which case
the code is
.P1
	goto L+1
L	continue
.P2
In this latter case,
the code
.P1
L+1	continue
.P2
is produced after the
.ul
statement
part of the
.UL else.
Code generation for the various loops is equally simple.
.PP
One might argue that more care should be taken
in code generation.
For example,
if there is no trailing
.UL else ,
.P1
	if (i > 0) x = a
.P2
should be left alone, not converted into
.P1
	if (.not. (i .gt. 0)) goto 100
	x = a
100	continue
.P2
But what are optimizing compilers for, if not to improve code?
It is a rare program indeed where this kind of ``inefficiency''
will make even a measurable difference.
In the few cases where it is important,
the offending lines can be protected by `%'.
.PP
The use of a compiler-compiler is definitely the preferred method
of software development.
The language is well-defined,
with few syntactic irregularities.
Implementation is quite simple;
the original construction took under a week.
The language
is sufficiently simple, however, that an
.ul
ad hoc
recognizer can be readily constructed to do the same job
if no compiler-compiler is available.
.PP
The C version of 
Ratfor
is used on
.UC UNIX
and on the Honeywell
.UC GCOS
systems.
C compilers are not as widely available as Fortran, however,
so there is also a
Ratfor
written in itself
and originally bootstrapped with the C version.
The
Ratfor
version
was written so as to translate into the portable subset
of Fortran described in [1],
so it is portable,
having been run essentially without change
on at least twelve distinct machines.
(The main restrictions of the portable subset are:
only one character per machine word;
subscripts in the 
form
.ul
c*v\(+-c;
avoiding expressions in places like
.UC DO
loops;
consistency in subroutine argument usage,
and in 
.UC COMMON
declarations.
Ratfor
itself will not gratuitously generate non-standard Fortran.)
.PP
The
Ratfor
version is about 1500 lines of
Ratfor
(compared to about 1000 lines of C);
this compiles into 2500 lines of Fortran.
This expansion ratio is somewhat higher than average,
since the compiled code contains unnecessary occurrences
of
.UC COMMON
declarations.
The execution time of the
Ratfor
version is dominated by
two routines that read and write cards.
Clearly these routines could be replaced
by machine coded local versions;
unless this is done, the efficiency of other parts of the translation process
is largely irrelevant.
