.SH NAME
fstat \- file status
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fstat
[
.B \-u
user ] [
.B \-p
pid ] [
.B filename... 
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Fstat
identifies open files.
A file is considered open if a process has it open,
if it is the working directory for a process,
or if it is an active pure text file.
If no options are specified,
.I fstat
reports on all open files.
.PP
Options:
.TP 6
.B  \-u
Report all files open by the specified user.
.TP 6
.B  \-p
Report all files open by the specified process.
.TP 6
.B filename...
Restrict reports to the specified files.
If the file is a block special file,
.I fstat
additionally reports on any open files on that device,
treating it as a mounted file system.  
.PP
The following fields are printed:
.TP 6
.B  USER
The username of the owner of the process.
.TP 6
.B CMD
The command name of the process.
.TP 6
.B PID
The process id.
.TP 6
.B FD
The file number in the per-process open file table.  The special
names ``text'' and ``wd'' mean that the file is the pure text inode
or the working directory for the process.
If the file number is followed by an asterisk (``*''), then the file is
not an inode, but is a socket or a FIFO or has an error of some kind.
In this case the rest of the entry is in variable format, doesn't
correspond to the rest of the headings, and is enclosed in parentheses.
.TP 6
.B DEVICE
Major/minor number of the device this file exists on.
.TP 6
.B INODE
The inode number of the file.
.TP 6
.B SIZE
The size, in bytes, of the file.
.TP 6
.B TYPE
The type of the file (see
.IR stat (2)).
.SH Sockets
The formating of open sockets depends on the protocol domain.
In all cases the first field is the domain name, the second field
is the socket type (stream, dgram, etc), and the third is the socket
flags field (in hex).
The remaining fields are protocol dependent.
For tcp, it is the address of the tcpcb, and for udp, the inpcb (socket pcb).
For unix domain sockets, its the address of the socket pcb and the address
of the connected pcb (if connected).
Otherwise the protocol number and address of the socket itself are printed.
The attempt is to not duplicate
.IR netstat (1),
but rather to make enough information available to permit further analysis.
.PP
For example, the addresses mentioned above are the addresses which the
``netstat -A'' command would print for tcp, udp, and unixdomain.
Note that since pipes are implemented using sockets, a pipe appears as a
connected unix domain stream socket.
A unidirectional unix domain socket indicates the direction of flow with
an arrow (``<-'' or ``->''), and a full duplex socket shows a double arrow
(``<->'').
.SH BUGS
Since
.I fstat
takes a snapshot of the system, it is only correct for a very short period
of time.
