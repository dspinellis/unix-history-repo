@(#)how_pix	1.1 (Berkeley) %G%
To translate and execute a program with pix, place the source in a file
whose name ends in the characters ".p", i.e. "prog.p".  The command
	pix prog.p
will translate the program into interpreter code which will be then be executed
If there are compilation errors `E', then execution will be suppressed.
To create a permanent "obj" file which you can interpret, use "pi".
Type "pi" for basic information on pi.

The complete command line syntax for pix is
	pix [ -blnpstuw ] [ -i file ... ] name.p [ arg ... ]
Here the trailing arguments are passed to your Pascal program.
This command is equivalent to
	pi [ -blnpstuw ] [ -i file ... ] name.p
and then
	px scratch [ arg ... ]
where scratch is a temporary file which is then removed.

The command "man pi" will give information as to the options of pix.
Refer to the UNIX Pascal User's Manual for more details.
