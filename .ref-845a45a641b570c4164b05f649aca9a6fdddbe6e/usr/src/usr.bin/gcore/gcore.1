.Sh NAME
.Nm gcore
.Nd get core images of running process
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm gcore
.Op Fl s
.Op Fl c Ar core
.Ar exec pid
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Gcore
creates a core image of the specified process,
suitable for use with
.Xr gdb  1 .
By default, the core is written to the file
.Dq Pa core.<pid> .
Both the executable image,
.Ar exec ,
and the process identifier,
.Ar pid ,
must be given on the command line.
.Pp
The options are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c
Write the core file to the specified file instead of
.Dq Pa core.<pid> .
.It Fl s
Stop the process while gathering the core image, and resume it
when done.  This guarantees that the resulting core dump will
be in a consistent state.  The process is resumed even if it was
already stopped.
The same effect can be achieved manually with 
.Xr kill 1 .
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/log/messages -compact
.It Pa core.<pid>

.Sh HISTORY
.Nm Gcore
appeared in 4.2BSD.
.Sh BUGS
Context switches or paging activity that occur while
.Nm gcore
is running may cause the program to become confused.
For best results, use -s to temporarily stop the target process.

.Nm Gcore
is not compatible with the original 4.2BSD version.  In particular, 4.4BSD
requires the 
.Ar exec
argumemt.
