.Sh NAME
.Nm kgmon
.Nd generate a dump of the operating system's profile buffers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm kgmon
.Op Fl bhpr
.Op Fl M core
.Op Fl N system
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Kgmon
is a tool used when profiling the operating system.
When no arguments are supplied,
.Nm kgmon
indicates the state of operating system profiling as running,
off, or not configured.
(see
.Xr config 8 )
If the
.Fl p
flag is specified,
.Nm kgmon
extracts profile data from the operating system and produces a
.Pa gmon.out
file suitable for later analysis by
.Xr gprof 1 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b
Resume the collection of profile data.
.It Fl h
Stop the collection of profile data.
.It Fl p
Dump the contents of the profile buffers into a
.Pa gmon.out
file.
.It Fl r
Reset all the profile buffers. 
If the
.Fl p
flag is also specified, the
.Pa gmon.out
file is generated before the buffers are reset.
.It Fl M
Extract values associated with the name list from the specified core
instead of the default ``/dev/kmem''.
.It Fl N
Extract the name list from the specified system instead of the
default ``/vmunix''.
.El
.Pp
If neither 
.Fl b
nor
.Fl h
is specified, the state of profiling collection remains unchanged.
For example, if the
.Fl p
flag is specified and profile data is being collected,
profiling will be momentarily suspended,
the operating system profile buffers will be dumped,
and profiling will be immediately resumed.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/kmemx -compact
.It Pa /vmunix
the default system
.It Pa /dev/kmem
the default memory

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Users with only read permission on
.Pa /dev/kmem
cannot change the state
of profiling collection. 
They can get a 
.Pa gmon.out
file with the warning that the data may be
inconsistent if profiling is in progress.

.Nm
command appeared in
