 * Sun-4c S-bus definitions.  (Should be made generic!)
 *
 * Sbus slot 0 is not a separate slot; it talks to the onboard I/O devices.
 * It is, however, addressed just like any `real' Sbus.
 *
 * Sbus device addresses are obtained from the FORTH PROMs.  They come
 * in `absolute' and `relative' address flavors, so we have to handle both.
 * Relative addresses do *not* include the slot number.
