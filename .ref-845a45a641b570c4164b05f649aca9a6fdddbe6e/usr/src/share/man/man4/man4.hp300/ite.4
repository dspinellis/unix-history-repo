.Sh NAME

.Tn HP
Internal Terminal Emulator
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Tn TTY
special files of the form ``ttye?''
are interfaces to the
.Tn HP ITE
for bit-mapped displays as implemented under
.Bx .
An
.Tn ITE
is the main system console on most
.Tn HP300
workstations and
is the mechanism through which a user communicates with the machine.
If more than one display exists on a system,
any or all can be used as
.Tn ITE Ns s
with the limitation that only the first
one opened will have a keyboard (since only one keyboard is supported).
.Pp
.Tn ITE
devices use the
.Tn HP-UX
.Sq Li 300h
.Xr termcap 5
or
.Xr terminfo 5
entries.
However, as currently implemented,
the
.Tn ITE
does not support the full range of
.Tn HP-UX
capabilities for this device.
Missing are multiple colors, underlining, blinking, softkeys,
programmable tabs, scrolling memory and keyboard arrow keys.
The keyboard does not have any of the international character
support of
.Tn HP Ns 's
.Tn NLS
system.
It does use the left and right
.Em extend char
keys as meta keys, in that it will set the eighth bit of the character code.
.Pp
Upon booting, the kernel will first look for an
.Tn ITE
device
to use as the system console
.Pq Pa /dev/console .
If a display exists at any hardware address, it will be the console.
The kernel looks for, in order:
a 98544, 98545, or 98547 Topcat display,
a 98700 Gatorbox at a supported address (see
.Xr gb 4 ) ,
or a 98720 Renaissance at a supported address (see
.Xr rb 4 ) .
Currently there is no
.Tn ITE
support for the
98548, 98549, 98550 and 98556 boards.
.Pp
When activated as an
.Tn ITE
(special file opened),
all displays go through a standard initialization sequence.
The frame buffer is cleared,
the
.Tn ROM
fonts are unpacked and loaded into off-screen storage and
a cursor appears.
The
.Tn ITE
initialization routine also sets the colormap entry used to white.
Variable colors are not used, mainly for reasons of simplicity.
The font pixels are all set to 0xff and the colormap entry corresponding
to all planes is set to R=255, G=255 and B=255.
The actual number of planes used to display the characters depends
on the hardware installed.
Finally, if the keyboard
.Tn HIL
device is not already assigned to another
.Tn ITE
device, it is placed in ``cooked'' mode and assigned to this
.Tn ITE .
.Pp
On most systems,
a display is used both as an
.Tn ITE
.Pf ( Pa /dev/ttye?
aka
.Pa /dev/console )
and as a graphics device
.Pq /dev/grf? .
In this environment,
there is some interaction between the two uses that should be noted.
For example, opening
.Pa /dev/grf0
will deactivate the
.Tn ITE ,
that is, write over whatever may be on the
.Tn ITE
display.
When the graphics application is finished and
.Pa /dev/grf0
closed,
the
.Tn ITE
will be reinitialized with the frame buffer cleared
and the
.Tn ITE
colormap installed.
