#
# this is a shell script that get's "sourced" when building and
# installing TranScript software.  It sets up definitions of the
# places that TranScript wants to do it's work.
# This script is concerned with the software itself, not with
# the printers.  Another script (???) is used to configure printers.
#
# If you change the values in this script, parts of the TranScript
# system may need to be remade (recompiled), and reinstalled.

# BINDIR
#	This is a directory where TranScript user programs are put.
#	It should be in the PATH of each user that want's to use them.
#	Many UNIX sites will keep these kinds of programs separate
#	from the regular UNIX utilites but in a well-known spot, like
#	"/usr/local/bin", "/usr/local", etc.  Whatever you choose,
#	make sure it's in people's search paths.  The TranScript
#	installation sequence will write in this directory.
#BINDIR=/usr/bin
BINDIR=/usr/local

# PSLIBDIR
#	This is a directory where TranScript keeps lots of things:.
#	spooler interface filters, font metrics files, prologue files,
#	and executables needed by TranScript or administrators, but not
#	by general users.
#PSLIBDIR=/usr/lib/ps
PSLIBDIR=/usr/local/lib/ps

# OWNER GROUP
#	User and group names for installed files
#	On BSD systems, this is typically "root" and "staff"
OWNER=bin
GROUP=bin

# PSTEMPDIR
#	The temporary directory you want TranScript filters to use
#	when necessary.  Sometimes this may need to hold a large print
#	file, so choose a tmp directory on a filesystem with enough
#	space.
#PSTEMPDIR=/usr/tmp
PSTEMPDIR=/tmp

# MAN1 MAN7 MAN8
#	The places you want the on-line manual pages installed.
#	If you want them all in the same place, 
#	(e.g., /usr/man/manl), set them all to that.
#MAN1=/usr/man/man1

# DITDIR
#	DITDIR/devpsc is where the "ditroff" fonts used by 
#	psdit and psroff go.
#DITDIR=/usr/lib/font
DITDIR=/usr/local/lib/font

# MAKEDEV 
#	is the FULL pathname of the makedev program for ditroff
#	(for Berkeley ditroff, this file is called "devconfig")
#	You may have to go hunting to find it (maybe even recompile it)
#	If you do not have ditroff (i.e., don't have makedev), set 
#	MAKEDEV=boguscmd
#MAKEDEV=/usr/bin/makedev
MAKEDEV=/usr/src/local/ditroff/bin/devconfig

# TROFFFONTDIR
#	This is the directory where the 
#	utility "ptroff" and "pscat" find their fonts.
#	DON'T make it /usr/lib/font if you can help it!
TROFFFONTDIR=$PSLIBDIR/troff.font

# BANNERFIRST BANNERLAST
#	These determine the default actions to take with job banner pages.
#	These pages (printed by the spooler to identify a job) may
#	be printed either before the job itself (so that you know
#	by looking in the output tray whose print job is active) or
#	after the job (so that they stack nicely), or both, or neither.
#	These flags may be set on a per-printer basis, so you don't need
#	to worry about them much here.
BANNERFIRST=1
BANNERLAST=0

# VERBOSELOG
#	Indicates that verbose job logging should take place in the 
#	printer log files.  It can be reset on a per-printer basis,
#	so don't worry about it here.
VERBOSELOG=1
