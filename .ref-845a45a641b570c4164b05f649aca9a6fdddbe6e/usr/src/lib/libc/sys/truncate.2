.Sh NAME
.Nm truncate ,
.Nm ftruncate

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <unistd.h>
.Ft int
.Fn truncate "const char *path" "off_t length"
.Ft int
.Fn ftruncate "int fd" "off_t length"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn Truncate
causes the file named by
.Fa path
or referenced by
.Fa fd
to be truncated to at most
.Fa length
bytes in size.  If the file previously
was larger than this size, the extra data
is lost.
With
.Fn ftruncate ,
the file must be open for writing.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
A value of 0 is returned if the call succeeds.  If the call
fails a -1 is returned, and the global variable
.Va errno
specifies the error.
