system bootstrapping procedures
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Sy Power fail and crash recovery.
Normally, the system will reboot itself at power-up or after crashes.
An automatic consistency check of the file systems will be performed,
and unless this fails, the system will resume multi-user operations.
.Pp
.Sy Cold starts.
On an HP300, the boot procedure uses the boot ROM to load a boot program
from an
.Tn LIF
format directory at the beginning of an attached disk.
The
.Pa /usr/mdec
directory contains a disk boot programs which should be placed in a
new pack automatically by
.Xr newfs 8
when the ``a'' partition file system on the pack is created.
.Pp
This
.Em boot
program
finds the corresponding file on the given device 
.Pf ( Ar vmunix
by default),
loads that file into memory,
and starts the program at the entry address specified in the program header.
.Pp
The boot program can be interrupted by typing `^C' (ctrl-C).
This will force the boot program to interactively prompt for a system to boot.
If not interrupted, it will boot from the device from which the boot
program itself was loaded.
.Pp
The file specifications used for an interactive boot are of the form:
.Pp
.Dl device(unit, minor)
.Pp
where
.Ar device
is the type of the device to be searched,
.Ar unit
is 8 * the hpib number plus the unit number of the disk or tape,
and
.Ar minor
is the disk partition or tape file number.
Normal line editing characters can be used when typing the file specification.
Currently, ``rd'' and ``sd'' are the only valid
.Ar device
specifiers.
.Pp
For example,
to boot from the `a' file system of unit 0 on HP-IB 2,
type
.Ql rd(16, 0)vmunix
to the boot prompt.
For tapes, the minor device number gives a file offset.
.Pp
In an emergency, the bootstrap methods described in the paper
.%T Installing 4.3bsd on the HP300
can be used to boot from a distribution tape.
