I understand that my accounts on source machines at Berkeley are to be used
only to assist in the development of, and for the review of, Berkeley UNIX.
I will not copy any source or documentation from a Berkeley machine to any
other machine without the explicit written or electronic approval of a CSRG
staff member.
