This directory contains source for most of the
documents contained in Volume 2 of The UNIX
Programmer's Manual, 7th Edition.
Most use -ms to format; many also use
refer, tbl and eqn. Precise incantations
are engraved in ./run.

The citations for those papers that use
refer are taken from /usr/dict/papers/Rv7man.
