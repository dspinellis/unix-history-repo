.pp
During the first three months of the contract, the DASH Project
has proceeded with the design and the implementation of the second
version of the DASH operating system on Sun 3/50 workstations and Ethernets.
.pp
The core of the message-passing system has been implemented and
experimented with. The results obtained have been quite encouraging: with
the VM remapping approach adopted in DASH, large messages can be moved
between user virtual address spaces at a rate in excess of 30 Mbytes/s,
whereas software copying can only achieve a rate of about 2 Mbytes/s.
Also, the overhead of one message-passing operation has been found
to be low, and therefore the local IPC performance for short messages
is not sacrificed by our design. These results, and the others, that are
described in [Tzou and Anderson 1988], have confirmed the soundness of
the basic design decisions.
.pp
The virtual memory system has been completely specified and
designed; that part of it which supports IPC regions has been
implemented and used in the message-passing experiments. The
implementation of the remainder of the VM system has begun.
.pp
The design of the network and subtransport layers, as well as
that of kernel RPC, has also made substantial progress, and has been
partially implemented. A study of the feasibility of implementing the
real-time message stream abstraction (in particular, deterministic
and probabilistic performance guarantees) on top of current virtual-circuit
networks is close to its successful completion.
.pp
The second version of the DASH kernel is also being ported to a Sequent
Symmetry shared-memory multiprocessor. A small part of the kernel has
recently run on the machine, and the other parts will follow.
The experiments to be performed on the DASH kernel in the Sequent
environment are now being designed.

\fB\s+2Berkeley UNIX Project\s0\fP
.pp
We looked into the costs of joining acunet, reviewed Marshall
Rose's proposal to /usr/group for a networking standard, made known
our impressions and attended the /usr/group working group meeting
at the end of June.
We have reviewed another potential network interface standard
submitted by Steven Head of Hewlett Packard,
and have begun discussions with him about it.
We are continuing our discussions with interested parties at
Wollongong and Hewlett Packard as part of the effort to arrive at a
POSIX standard for network interfaces.
.pp
We have implemented and tested some of our planned revisions to
Socket calls in Berkeley UNIX, namely receiving and sending data
while supporting constructions such as end-of-record marks, obtaining
indications of out-of-band data without having to poll separately for them.
Our intent is to provide this interface to OSI services; our testing method
was to modify XNS code to use them (since this is already integrated and
working in Berkeley UNIX).
We modified the kernel to allow for large, variable
length network addresses (necessary for long ISO TSELs),
implemented backward compatibility routines, and tested the changes.
.pp
We reviewed existing ethernet drivers with an eye towards
implementing new functionality required for OSI services (such as
multi-cast reception and transmission), and unification (or
identification and collecting) of common code.
.pp
We implemented some low-level 802.2 support for 8 ethernet drivers,
and began adding support for enabling multicast reception.  The 802.2
support was made available to colleagues at the University of Wisconsin,
who will incorporate it in their upcoming release of ISO for the IBM RT.
.pp
The kernel network buffering strategies were revised
to support typed data and record marks and to make them more portable.
The portability changes will also improve network performance
on architectures without page-mapped I/O.
.pp
We designed and coded an alternate interface for communicating routing
changes with the kernel (after soliciting comments from colleagues
at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and the University of Wisconsin),
and designed and coded our own algorithm for hierarchical routing lookups.
.pp
The version of TCP with the new ``slow-start,'' round-trip time estimation,
and congestion control
algorithms has been tested extensively, and is included in the current
Berkeley ``Tahoe'' test release.
It has been adopted by many vendors of 4.2BSD- and 4.3BSD-derived
networking software.
Additional performance experiments have been done by
Van Jacobson of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory,
and several additional performance improvements are ready
to be merged into the Berkeley TCP.
.pp
The prototype POSIX terminal driver that was developed to validate
the P1003.1 terminal driver specification has been used to
produce a fully POSIX-compliant interface.
In addition, a binary compatibility interface has been developed
to allow a transition path for programs using the old Berkeley
terminal driver.
Most of the system utilities that manipulate terminals have been
converted to use the new terminal driver.
.pp
A POSIX session and job control implementation has been developed.
Those system utilities that create sessions and manipulate jobs have
been converted to use the new facilities.
Numerous other smaller POSIX related changes are also being made.
