.Sh NAME
.Nm make_keypair
.Nd generate Kerberos host key pair
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm make_keypair
.Ar hostname
.Op Ar hostname ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm make_keypair
command
is used to create pairs of
.Tn DES
keys for
each
.Ar hostname .
The keys are used by privileged programs such as
.Xr register 1
to make remote updates to the Kerberos database without
having to have first acquired a Kerberos ticket granting ticket
.Pq Tn TGT .
The keys created by
.Nm make_keypair
are placed (by hand) in the filesystems of the
kerberos server in
.Pa /etc/kerberosIV/register_keys ,
and in the root directory of the clients.
For example, the file
.Pa /.update.key128.32.130.3
would
contain a copy of the key of the client with
IP address 128.32.130.3.
These keys provide a shared secret which may be used to establish
a secure channel between the client hosts and the Kerberos server.
