.SH NAME
ching \- the book of changes and other cookies
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ching
[ hexagram ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I "I Ching"
or
.I "Book of Changes"
is an ancient Chinese oracle that has been in use for centuries
as a source of wisdom and advice.
.PP
The text of the
.I oracle
(as it is sometimes known) consists of sixty-four
.I hexagrams,
each symbolized by a particular arrangement of six straight (\-\-\-)
and broken (\-\ \-) lines.  These lines have values ranging
from six through nine, with the even values indicating the broken lines.
.PP
Each hexagram consists of two major sections.  The
.B  Judgement
relates specifically to the matter at hand (E.g.,
\*(lqIt furthers one to have somewhere to go.\*(rq) while the
.B  Image
describes the general attributes of the hexagram and how they apply
to one's own life (\*(lqThus the superior man makes himself strong
and untiring.\*(rq).
.PP
When any of the lines have the values six or nine, they are moving lines;
for each there is an appended judgement which becomes significant.
Furthermore, the moving lines are inherently unstable and
change into their opposites; a second hexagram
(and thus an additional judgement) is formed.
.PP
Normally, one consults the oracle by fixing the desired question
firmly in mind and then casting a set of changes (lines)
using yarrow\-stalks or tossed coins.  The resulting hexagram
will be the answer to the question.
.PP
Using an algorithm suggested by S. C. Johnson, the UNIX
.IR oracle " simply reads"
a question from the standard input (up to an EOF)
and hashes the individual characters in combination with the
time of day, process id and any other magic numbers which happen to be lying
around the system.  The resulting value is used as the seed
of a random number generator which drives a simulated coin\-toss divination.
The answer is then piped through
.BR nroff " for formatting"
and will appear on the standard output.
.PP
For those who wish to remain steadfast in the old traditions,
the oracle will also accept the results of a personal divination using,
for example, coins.  To do this, cast the change and then type the
resulting line values as an argument.
.PP
The impatient modern may prefer to settle for Chinese cookies; try
.IR fortune (6).
