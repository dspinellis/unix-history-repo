**  REST FOR REPAIRS
**
**	You sit around and wait for repairs to happen.  Actually, you
**	sit around and wait for anything to happen.  I do want to point
**	out however, that Klingons are not as patient as you are, and
**	they tend to attack you while you are resting.
**
**	You can never rest through a long range tractor beam.
**
**	In events() you will be given an opportunity to cancel the
**	rest period if anything momentous happens.
