.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Lpc

Without any arguments,
.Nm lpc
will prompt for commands from the standard input.
If arguments are supplied,
.Nm lpc
interprets the first argument as a command and the remaining
arguments as parameters to the command.  The standard input
may be redirected causing
.Nm lpc
to read commands from file.
Commands may be abreviated;
the following is the list of recognized commands.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic \&? No [ command ... ]
.It Ic help No [ command ... ]
Print a short description of each command specified in the argument list,
or, if no argument is given, a list of the recognized commands.
.Pp
.It Ic abort  No {\ all\ |\ printer\ }
Terminate an active spooling daemon on the local host immediately and
then disable printing (preventing new daemons from being started by
.Xr lpr )
for the specified printers.
.Pp
.It Ic clean  No {\ all\ |\ printer\ }
Remove any temporary files, data files, and control files that cannot
be printed (i.e., do not form a complete printer job)
from the specified printer queue(s) on the local machine.
.Pp
.It Ic disable  No {\ all\ |\ printer\ }
Turn the specified printer queues off.  This prevents new
printer jobs from being entered into the queue by
.Xr lpr .
.Pp
.It Ic down No {\ all\ |\ printer\ } message ...
Turn the specified printer queue off, disable printing and put
.Em message
in the printer status file. The message doesn't need to be quoted, the
remaining arguments are treated like
.Xr echo 1 .
This is normally used to take a printer down and let others know why
.Xr lpq 1
will indicate the printer is down and print the status message).
.Pp
.It Ic enable  No {\ all\ |\ printer\ }
Enable spooling on the local queue for the listed printers.

.Pp
.It Ic exit
.It Ic quit
Exit from lpc.
.Pp
.It Ic restart  No {\ all\ |\ printer\ }

If the user is the super-user,
try to abort the current daemon first (i.e., kill and restart a stuck daemon).

Enable printing and start a spooling daemon for the listed printers.
.Pp
.It Ic status  No {\ all\ |\ printer\ }
Display the status of daemons and queues on the local machine.
